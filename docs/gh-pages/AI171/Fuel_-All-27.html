     There are quite a few comments on here along the lines of "no one would do that", "that's highly unlikely", "that's impossible" etc. We need to remember that a highly unlikely event, a dual engine shutdown/fail, has undeniably happened. Given that a highly unlikely event has happened all of the possible unlikely events that could have caused it are actually reasonably likely
     <i>
      given
     </i>
     that we know the accident happened. Think of it this way, tossing 100 heads in a row is incredibly unlikely and tossing 99 heads in a row is also incredibly unlikely. However, if you happen to toss 100 heads in a row then the incredibly unlikely 99 heads that came before the 100th are a certainty. They had to have happened for the 100 heads to happen.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     This accident was caused by an unlikely sequence of events. If it wasn't then similar accidents would happen more often. Therefore we can't rule out possibilities just because they're unlikely. It's worthwhile considering the
     <i>
      relative
     </i>
     likelihood of different scenarios. For example is it more likely that the fuel switches were turned off due to a selection error or a mechanical failure?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     This was not a normal flight. It resulted in an accident. There is little point in blathering on about how a normal crew operates on a normal flight.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I've studiously avoided commenting on this accident, for good reasons. And looking at the history, many others would have benefited from the same restraint.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And I won't comment now. But this article, about another classic "no one would do that" scenario is pertinent and worth reading in its own right:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/magazine/fatal-distraction-forgetting-a-child-in-thebackseat-of-a-car-is-a-horrifying-mistake-is-it-a-crime/2014/06/16/8ae0fe3a-f580-11e3-a3a5-42be35962a52_story.html" target="_blank">
   https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifes...a52_story.html
  </a>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's precisely the ones who loudly proclaim "I would NEVER do that", "that could NEVER happen to me" who are most at risk. And that is relevant to aviation too. IMHO.

     No experience of the 787 but lots on the 75/76.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The possibility of a perceived stab trim problem allied to an associated eicas message could have induced the PNF to go straight to the stab trim switches mindful of the problems associated with the 737 Max albeit a different type and a system not fitted in the 787 but an issue of which the Training Captain would have been well aware especially if he had been briefed on the stab messages from the previous sector. If, repeat if, he simply made the wrong selection and hit the fuel cut off switches then the holes have suddenly lined up. Unlikely, unfathomable perhaps but by no means impossible. Other than that....deliberate act ?
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  no experience of Boeing at all here but would a stab trim issue have been highlighted by EICAS that early? I assume Boeings have take off inhibit logic to hide certain less than emergency conditions until above ~1500AGL? Would a Stab issue have been serious enough to immediately pop up?

  Placing the fuel control switches to cutoff is not \x93hard\x94 but you certainly need some force to do it.
  <br/>
  They certainly can not jump across the safeguard by themselves. (in turbulence for example)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  this whole scenario is simply far beyond my comprehension.
  <br/>
  what happened to crew coordination when selecting fuel switches? Even in a perceived emergency situation, the switcher needs to confirm the perception.

     My only question is, after close to 40 years flying, on takeoff, if I lost thrust/ Power, my immediate reaction would NOT BE TO CHECK THE FUEL CONTROL SWITCHES. Unless the Pilot flying saw the Pilot monitoring visually reach down and shut the fuel control switches off, which would be odd since as the PF, your attention is looking at the instruments and outside, not inside and downward in the direction of the FC switches. It seems odd how quickly they ascertained the fuel control switches were shut off. No startle factor, or confusion, just a very quick determination that the FC switches were cutoff. Very strange.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  This puzzled me as well and got me thinking about the quick diagnosis of the problem.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If one of the two pilots had preplanned this action, and didn\x92t want to be blamed for it, he will have known the conversation would be recorded, so he moves the switches to cut off, then immediately challenges the other pilot about the action, which of course he denies. One of them resets the switches to run, but by then it is too late.

  <u>
   Language:
  </u>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Having lived in the Middle East for over 20 years, I am somewhat used to the Indian use of the English language. Therefore, I wouldn't look too closely at the usage of "transitioned"; it simply means moving from one condition to another.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The conversation of the pilots, on the other hand, will be very interesting. It should be analysed in the language they were speaking, considering whether this was their native language to start with. I assume that the conversation was in Hindi, translated to English for the report. In that case alone, a lot of nuance might have been lost in translation. That's without even considering the tone, volume etc. of the conversation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <u>
   Procedure:
  </u>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I am an Airbus driver, so I am not familiar with the B787 EICAS. On the Bus, the ECAM would generate an
  <u>
   ENG
  </u>
  FAIL, followed shortly thereafter by an
  <u>
   ENG
  </u>
  ALL ENGINE FAILURE. I assume the B787 would have a similar event on the EICAS. Now, considering the time frame of how quickly things happened, there is absolutely no reason for the pilots to assume something was wrong with both engine cutoffs, unless they were physically switched off by someone. We are not trained to consider a fuel cutoff switch as the main reason for an engine failure, especially on the takeoff roll.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <u>
   Question?
  </u>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When I was a young F/O, some of the captains I flew with had the (annoying) habit of resting their hands just behind the thrust levers on their PM (PNF) sectors to 'be ready' to reject the takeoff. This would put the hands in the vicinity of the Fuel Cutoffs, which would, in turn, increase the chances of an unintended action on these switches. Is this a possibility, or am I way off?

     To those who still try to put the blame on the switches...
     <br/>
     - If the switches were defective (wrong type without the detent was installed), this airplane has been in operation for 10+ years - somebody would have noticed.
     <br/>
     - If the switches were defective due to wear, it's impossible that both would fail simultaneously at exactly the same time. Have you ever seen all FOUR wheel bearings in a car fail within one second of each other?
     <br/>
     - If this was an electric issue (spilled coffee theory), there is no way that ALL electrical contact simultaneously shorted into the exact condition to cut off the fuel. We would see one or two contacts fail first and some kind of "command disagreement", but not a nearly instantaneous total failure. Maybe only if somebody spilled a glass of mercury over the switches ...
     <br/>
     The only plausible explanation is that somebody moved them (for a reason unknown).
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Agreed: you would not see all contacts failing the same way, at the same time, in a multi-pole switch like that. Nothing is impossible, of course but the odds of that happening in one switch are extremely low. Two switches, at the same time?.
  <br/>
  Ditto for the idea of the physical detents failing, causing the switch lever to drop at the worst time. Not impossible, again, but both switches within a second of each other? Very low odds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Am I correct in thinking that engine cutoff would in flight would trigger a warning on EICAS?

  It's established fact both fuel control switches moved to CUTOFF 4 seconds after Vr, a deliberate guarded action, not easily done accidentally.
  <br/>
  The CVR records one pilot asking &ldquo;Why did you cut off?&rdquo;, the other replies &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t&rdquo;. Then a bland Mayday attributed to the Captain &ldquo;engine failure, returning&rdquo; in the middle of the crisis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The language, if reported correctly, feels strangely detached. No confusion, no urgency, no clear troubleshooting. Not drawing conclusions, but does anyone else see signs of performative behaviour, that is saying the right things outwardly, while being at odds with the underlying cause?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I appreciate that both crew members lost their lives, however if we avoid discussing uncomfortable patterns, we miss the point of investigation and learning.

  Really? It suggests to me and I would imagine the vast majority of us who have flown modern Boeings that they were physically moved, by one of the crew, one at a time, the question is why.

  We can be sure this switches and their locking mechanism were carefully inspected in the wreckage .
  <br/>
  <br/>
  since there is no grounding of the 787 fleet i think nobody considers the switches were defective but it seems to be clear for the investigators they were pulled and switched to cutoff by pilot action .

  The investigation probably now concentrates by whom of them both and to find out if it was a catastrophic operation error in a mental blackout or a concious , deliberate action .

  The accident aircraft was written up for a status message of &rdquo;STAB POS XDCR&rdquo; on the previous flight, which is a message relating to implausible data from the stab trim switches. It was released from maintenance (according to the preliminary report) at 06:40UTC ahead of an 07:40UTC departure (the crash flight) with &rdquo;no fault found&rdquo;.
  <br>
   <br>
    On the 787-8, as all modern planes, switches are not cabled as dry closing contacts all the way from the switch poles to the affected end devices (FADECs in the case of fuel cutoff switches), but rather connect locally to an analogue/digital converter to encode the switch position data onto the digital comms bus ARINC629 which allows all aircraft systems to talk to one another.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Are the fuel cutoff switches, which are positioned adjacent to the stab trim switches, connected to the same ADC module which produced the error message on the previous flight, which maintenance was unable to resolve before the accident flight took off?  I do not know, but it must be worthy of being looked into.

  Previous media reports (from supposedly well-placed sources) talked about &lsquo;voltage spikes&rsquo;, &lsquo;rapid power disruptions&rsquo;, &lsquo;faulty power-panel components&rsquo; and &lsquo;EEC glitches&rsquo; inferring an uncommanded electronic state change in the fuel switches.

     (Admin/Mod)Folks, it appears that the message isn't getting through.
     <br/>
     There were two professional pilots on that flight deck.
     <br/>
     It is not acceptable to effectively accuse
     <u>
      <b>
       both
      </b>
     </u>
     of a criminal act, because there is no evidence to identify which hand -
     <u>
      <b>
       if either
      </b>
     </u>
     - moved the fuel switches, or for what purpose or reason.
     <br/>
     Unless and until any such evidence is published by the relevant authorities, kindly desist from doing so out of respect for your professional colleagues.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  The Mods have stuck to this principle, which I shall try to adhere to.
  <br/>
  This preliminary report is just that, but maybe consider the issues the Indian AAIB have had to address in publishing it. They will have a similar concern to the pP mods, maybe more so since any apparent accusations directed at the pilots may lead to physical retribution.
  <br/>
  I therefore conclude great care has been taken to "sanitise" what the AAIB know, or at least strongly suspect, (from EAFR) into the report. They have conspicuously failed to identify which of the pilots was each half of the conversation they have not repeated the exact words, there's a lot missing (was positive rate ever called, was rotate ever called, any discussion about putting FC back to Run, who/how flying aircraft meanwhile). As a result we, the reader, should step back and not over-interpret this sanitised report.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Secondly, given the mod statement above,
  <b>
   <u>
    if
   </u>
  </b>
  a criminal act is suspected by the AAIB, this will likely trigger all sorts of 'primacy' issues in the investigation i.e. police? AAIB? or joint? and all the history that involves (SAS Linate?) - in Europe we have 996-2010 Article 12 para 2, but India?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <b>
   Summary
  </b>
  : For good reason I believe this report has been very carefully worded, sanitised with great care, and as such easy to inappropriately speculate what went on.

     From the report, there is no indicated time stamp identifying the point when one pilot asked the other "why did you cut off"
     <br/>
     This could explain the the assumption that it took ten seconds to reverse the switch positions.
     <br/>
     Cut off could have been noticed at any point later than 08:08:42 but before 08:08:52.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  From my reading of the AAIB report, the delay in noticing the cut off switch position could not have been any later than 08:08:47 because the reference to the verbal exchange was written before the reference to the RAT deployment and I assume the written narrative follows the chronological sequence of events.  The delay in resetting those fuel switches might therefore have been no more than 5 seconds.  It is a pity that the pilot making the challenge didn't simply reset the switches to run instead of challenging the other pilot.  I frequently tell people who blow their horns at pedestrians or other motorists that blowing the horn isn't going to help them avoid an accident and that what they really need to do in the limited time available to them is concentrate on applying the brakes and turning the steering wheel.

  I cannot imagine a situation where any pilot would be moving a crew bag within seconds of getting airborne.

  From the report it is clear that the switches were selected to cut off, we will likely NEVER know why, maybe the CVR gives a few more clues but we will never know if it was an intentional or accidental act. What is clear is that during rotation you are never fiddling with bags etc.

   Was the RAT deployed manually?

  The report says,
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
   <i>
    As per the EAFR data both engines N2 values passed below minimum idle speed, and the

    RAT hydraulic pump began supplying hydraulic power at about 08:08:47 UTC.

  This was 5 seconds after the fuel was cut off.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It suggests to me that the RAT deployment was initiated while the engines were still above idle and generating electrical power. Obviously one of the pilots could have done it via depressing the switch, as it's a "dual engine failure/stall" memory item (see
  <a href="https://www.pprune.org/accidents-close-calls/666581-air-india-ahmedabad-accident-12th-june-2025-part-2-a-70.html#post11918946" target="_blank">

  Is there a way for the RAT to deploy while the engines are still above idle?

   <br/>
   <br/>
   This extract from the datasheet of the Honeywell switch installed in the B787 for switching between Cut Off and Run shows the various gates that can be incorporated in such a switch.  I suspect that it is Configuration D which allows the switch to be in one or other of only 2 positions.  But the centre gate has a relatively wide flat table on which the switch can rest if it is not moved correctly to either the Run or Cut Off position.  I therefore think that it is not beyond the realm of possibility that both switches may have initially been resting on the gate and then slipped into the cut off position during take off.  However, what militates against this theory are the words of the challenge, "Why did you do that?" suggesting that one pilot had seen the other pilot actually flip the switches.
