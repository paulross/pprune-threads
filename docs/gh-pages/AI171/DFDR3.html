  The Enhanced Airborne Flight Recorder (EAFR) fitted in the forward and aft locations are interchangeable and appear to be able to record video.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As their power requirements are 28 VDC and just 20.5 watts it seems strange that only the forward mounted unit should have a battery backup.

    T he Image Recorder growth function is used to record visual images of the flight deck instruments, flight deck, the aircraft structures, and engines as required. The Image Recorder function is capable of receiving a digital 10/100 Mbit Ethernet data stream of cockpit images and stores this data in the Crash Protected Memory in a separate partition. Even though the image recording duration will be governed by regulations, the EAFR Crash Protected Memory capacity has the storage capacity for two hours of image data recording per EUROCAE ED-112 requirements. Data in the Image Recording Crash Protected Memory partition can only be downloaded when the EAFR is off the aircraft.

  Different (older) aircraft, the flight recorders there did not have backup power iirc.

     in my first reply, I started typing, but then removed, 'one thing missing in the FDR's disaster survivability requirements, is 'politics resistance'. Not implying that in this case, except for some face saving moves, the 'thruth' is in danger.

  I had thought consideration for the preservation of truth might underlie India's reluctance to send the flight recorders across the Pacific Ocean. But it could simply be that the foreign accident boards and India have different opinions on how trustworthy India's flight recorder lab is. Negotiations ensue? Anyway, this is idle speculation on my part.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While impatient media might lament the delay, I think it is right that some time is spent on ensuring that the end result of the investigation is trustworthy. Even if that involves diplomacy.

   The RIPS unit is a certificated device that just has to supply 20.5 watts for ten minutes so cost cannot be a consideration.

   Another debate that should now be had is real time telemetry. Given the number of airlines contracting with Starlink for internet services onboard their fleets uploading the data stream fed to FDR's wouldn't put a dent on the available bandwidth and the search and recovery process for FDR's would be a thing of the past.

  The RIPS provides power to both the recorder and to the microphones in the cockpit.... If there's no power to the microphones, there is nothing to hear. If there's no power for systems in the aircraft.... then there's not going to be much for any recorder to record.

  Two minor points regarding competence and who gets the task of data extraction from the data recorders: Firstly, that it's the AAIB (India) which will decide where and when to hand over the data recorders, and secondly, the supposed comment attributed to the Ministry of Civil Aviation in the press release dated June 19 (
