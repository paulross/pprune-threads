     Nonsense.
     <br>
      <br>
       There isn't anything of a factual nature to tell us that the investigation is suffering 'political interference', or that there is any issue in the use of the new lab to extract data from the flight recorders. There's unsubstantiated and improbable speculation in the guise of reporting that the data recorders might get sent elsewhere, but no credible sign this was ever planned.
       <br>
        <br>
         Plus... 'flag carrier'? Air India is a wholly owned subsidiary of Tata, not an organ of state. And prior to it's purchase by them, the Indian government didn't seem overly concerned about the airline or its future. Hard to see why they would now.
         <br>
          <br>
           The only thing well founded will be found in the accident report.
          </br>

  Paraphrasing from the article above-
  <br>
   They originally refused to allow UN and ICAO observers as part of the investigation, but have now reversed course.
   <br>
    They gave one press conference in the last 30 days and no questions were taken.
    <br/>
    They took almost 2 weeks to read out the boxes.
    <br/>
    UN stated that it is up to the Country leading the investigation on wether to release the report at all- a frightening thought.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They are not being transparent, for whatever reason. I don't really care as I'm more concerned with the technical details of what went wrong or who did what that led to the accident.

     Yeah but thought it worth discussing again IF we believe that the engine failure was caused by a pilot selecting both fuel control switches to cutoff. You\x92re right that I can\x92t imagine myself doing it but fear can make our inner chimps do strange things in response to the flight or flight response. (See the chimp paradox book).

  Or we could wait two more days because certainly that would be in the flight recorder data.

     The flight recorder will witness what came first - Power loss or Start Switches to Cutoff? It seems the 'Third Contingency' that I alluded to about a thousand posts ago, sadly now seems likely.
    </div>
   </div>

  This. If power was lost first, it's complicated. If switches to cutoff was first, it may be a simple and unpalatable answer.
