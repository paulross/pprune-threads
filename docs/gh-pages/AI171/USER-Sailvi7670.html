  Takeoff roll and rotation looked normal. No tail clearance or any other issues to indicate anything abnormal until after the main gear left the runway and they were not retracted.

     Having read all the posts, watched the videos and with a 30 year background interest in air safety, I have a nagging feeling that the engine fuel cut off switches were pulled just after take-off. I am not saying this with the intention of idle speculation, it is just that to me nothing else seems to make sense. To anyone disagreeing with this, I really hope you are right and I am wrong.

  Delta airlines had a Captain do this in 1986 on a 757 out of LAX. Came within a few hundred feet of ditching. Then flew all the way to CVG with the rat hanging out!

     Okay. Wouldn't you still put the nose down? Aircraft remains in a nose up position and increases it's AOA all the way down unless it entered VMC and was out of control.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Why would you lower the nose and violently slam the aircraft into ground. The crew flew the aircraft exactly like you should in that situation. They traded angle of attack for descent rate and put the aircraft on the ground with the best chance of survival. Unfortunately with at least 110,000 lbs of fuel and buildings on the decent path the outcome was never going to be good. Doing so also bought them time to try and resolve the engine malfunction.

     Just as an example of how many misconceptions, mistruths, half truths and complete BS there is in this, and any accident, thread consider this\x85
     <br/>

     I am very sure the only variant of the 757/767 that had a RAT was the 767-400, which was not in production in 1986. I flew the 767-200 and -300 with 3 different engine combinations (around 30-40 different airframes and 2 airlines) and none of them had a RAT.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Happy to be corrected if this model 757 (or 767 as someone in a later post says) had a RAT.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Every 757/767 built has a RAT. When you did your walk arounds it was the large rectangular panel near the right aft wing root. Normally it was outlined in red and we were advised not to walk under it. If for some reason it extended the extension was somewhat violent and you would not want to be under it. Where were your ground schools?

  I wondered that myself however the ground roll and initial takeoff all seem normal. In addition I can\x92t conceive of pilots that would not be pushing the thrust levers forward as hard as they could in this situation.

     If the fuel was cut off, how long would it take until the engines spooled down? How long would it take, given wind-milling etc, for that to result in a loss of power? I'd love to see a timeline of the flight with the fuel being cut off that is remotely compatible with the events we saw, because I don't think it's possible.
    </div>

  I can tell you that when a jet engine has a catastrophic failure the loss of thrust is near instantaneous. Lost a tower shaft on a 767 which killed the fuel pump, hyd pump, oil pump ect&hellip; First cockpit indication and hard yaw almost coincidental.

     Nose down would be to get best glide - longest time in the air and max distance. Raising the nose up leads to a stall and brings the aircraft down faster than best glide. It's counter-intuitive, hence the tendency to pull the nose up in a stall or loss of power has to be trained out of pilots.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Incorrect at low altitude and already low airspeed. At 100 to 200 feet you are simply,y going to hit the ground much harder if you lower the nose. By the time they could probably form a rational thought they were already flaring for impact. With the gear and flaps extended pushing the nose down is going to put you into the ground instantly.

     The requirement to lift the cutoff switch out of the detent before moving it is an important point. However, those switches are close together and unless the the detent requires significant force I suggest that they could be operated together with one hand if that was an intentional action.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Extremely difficult to accomplish with one hand, might even be impossible. There also would be no muscle memory to do both at the same time. I was as most pilots taught always shut down one engine at a time even at the gate to insure you never build that type of habit pattern.

     Retracting the flaps would put them at the back of the power curve where drag increases with decreasing speed, causing the speed to reduce further!
     <br/>
     The trouble seems to start at the exact moment the gear should have been raised, putting the flaps up, iso the gear, would cause the kind of loss of lift you see in the video. From there on, being at the back of the power curve, only firewalling the thrust levers and extending the flaps again could have saved them.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Even if they selected the flaps to the next higher flap position on a flight to London the 787 would have been able to power out of it. The deceleration rate and aircraft attitude don\x92t suggest to me an inadvertent flap retraction. I have done this exercise in the 767-300ER and it\x92s almost a non event unless extremely heavy.

     sorry for coming back on this,,,BUT

     still lift-off speed is much more than expected,,,, and losing 12 knots in initial climb looks strange (when you are supposed to maintain V2+20)

  Not at all unusual. Wind speeds just fifty feet above the ground are often higher than ground level.

     RAT out? I think not. Sounds like aorflow changes as flaps retracted.
     <br/>
     Flap lever quadrant has a gate preventing quick lever movement past F1 position.
     <br/>
     So if flap lever selected on first movement, the lever goes to F1 position, where only the trailing edge flaps retracted whereas the slats remained at takeoff setting.
     <br/>
     Hoping against hope it wasn\x92t a brain fart!😖
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  The flight part is nothing like you would see with the flaps retracted from 5 to 1 and the aircraft would have been able to recover and fly out of that at their likely weight.

     Does the B787 have auto flap retract ? Possibly a fault in the system could cause the flaps to retract during the take off run which would not give a configuration warning at the start if they were set correctly. Aircraft uses more runway than normal which it seems to have done, crew become aware of the problem near rotation and miss retracting the landing gear while trying to work out what's going on.

  There is no auto flap retract on the 787.

     Default setup is left tank left engine, right tank right engine. Each engine also has two redundant pumps feeding it, meaning it can operate fully and normally on one operational engine fuel pump.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Furthermore, the engines cannot run from the center tank. There's no such thing. The center tank transfers to the outer tanks, when necessary or when running low or to resolve imbalances, either automatically or manually initated by the pilot for whatever reason. The engine fuel pumps only ever draw from their respective tank.
     <br/>
     It is as thus impossible for the center tank being empty to cause engine shutdown unless the main tanks were also empty, in which case we would: be in a lot of trouble, shouldn't be taking off, and wouldn't have a massive orange fireball.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Virtually everything in this post is wrong. The 787 fuel system is almost the same as the 767. The default setup is all fuel pumps on. Each wing tank sends fuel to the left or right respective manifold. The center (main) tank pumps send fuel to both manifolds and operate at a higher pressure than the wing tanks and will feed the manifolds for each side from its left or right pump before the wing tanks. If there is fuel in the center tank it is always burned first and directly supplies the manifolds to the engines. Once the center tank is empty the wing tanks then begin supplying fuel to their respective manifolds. If any pumps are inadvertently left off you will get a EICAS message and a light in the pump switch.

     <b>
      Flap/Slat Load Relief
     </b>
     <br/>
     In the primary mode, the flap load relief system protects the flaps from excessive air loads. If flap airspeed placard limits are exceeded with the flaps in the 15 through 30 position, LOAD RELIEF is displayed and
     <b>
      the flaps
     </b>
     <b>
      automatically retract
     </b>
     to a safe position appropriate to the airspeed. Load relief retraction is limited to flaps 5. When airspeed is reduced, the flaps automatically re&ndash;extend as airspeed allows. Re&ndash;extension is limited to the commanded flap position.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Thats a load relief system for a flap over speed. It never retracts the slats and only moves the flaps to the next position. There was definitely no overspeed of the flaps in this accident.

     Given the loads on the generators etc. at TO, I would say it won't take very long for the engine to spool down. Maybe around 5-7 seconds. Any differing opinions?

  Thrust loss from a loss of fuel flow is near instantaneous.

     Good point.
     <br/>
     GE already knows and so does Air India.
     <br/>
     For the SLF, GE will call my employer and paraphrasing here: this airframe that engine needs attention because of the following.

  Engine parameters are generally data linked in bursts. Usually every 30 minutes. If an engine parameter goes out of limits normally an alert will de sent immediately but in this case I doubt the alert would gave been sent before the power interruption. The black box will tell the story.

     This is probably a very stupid question, but what would happen if a BPCU fault (or other cause) led to VFSGs on opposite sides of the aircraft being connected to the same 230 VAC bus?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     My understanding is that the left engine VFSGs are not synchronized in frequency or phase with the right engine VFSGs. Cross-connecting them, electrically, could be quite violent from both an electrical and mechanical perspective.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Is it realistically possible that the torque shock from cross-connected VFSGs could damage their associated accessory drive trains to the extent that the associated FADEC alternators would no longer make power? In this situation, there would be a loss of aircraft electrical power due to the BPCU fault, no FADEC alternator power due to damage to the accessory drive train, and, therefore, no engine thrust.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I presume each VFSG has a frangible link to protect the accessory drive train in the event the VFSG seizes up, which ought to make this loss-of-engine-thrust scenario impossible, but presumption is not knowledge, and this is a possible failure chain that doesn't involve stacking up multiple 10e-9 events.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  What you suggest might be plausible. I had a tower shaft snap on a 767. The engine quits immediately. You lose fuel flow, oil pressure, generator and  hydraulic pressure instantly. That could account for the gear not coming up. In a normal shutdown or flameout hydraulic pressure is maintained for a considerable period of time and windmilling will provide some pressure. I would have expected the gear to move further up in the retraction cycle. Tie this in with claimed electrical issues and the concept is at least interesting.

     767 pilot here, on the 767 it would capture the altitude, but more importantly, it would freeze the airspeed at whatever speed the alt capture occurred at. So the thrust levers would retard to maintain the much slower speed at the point of capture. This could be a possible scenario, especially if the crew was slow to realize what happened, AND the 787 has a similar low altitude capture issue.
    </div>

  I agree with what you posted however the solution is so simple that I can\x92t believe a professional flight crew would not handle it without much of a blip. Push the trust  levers forward.
