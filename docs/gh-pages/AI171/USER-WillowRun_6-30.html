  You're referring to Pakistan Int'l Airlines 8303, accident date May 22, 2020, presumably; in which 97 of 99 persons on board the aircraft were killed, with one additional fatality of a person on the ground.

  Nothing about "legal" whatsoever in what follows.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the 12 years during which I have followed, and posted on, threads on this forum occasional objections to excessive uninformed posts and posters have been lodged. Recently the reasons for these objections have increased, and without question are acute on this thread (and maybe unprecedented).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  People in the aircraft piloting profession speak in a language in which laypeople generally do poorly, even when they sincerely try. The terminology or lexicons are one thing, and the bigger problem is that being a professional pilot means that the person has mastered (at any particular experience level of the profession) the process of thinking and reasoning . . . as a professional pilot. The useless and at times ridiculously incorrect stuff posted by laypeople often seems to have been written performatively. "Keyboard warriors" might be an outdated phrase but it lives on. But as one layperson who has learned a great deal here I hope the pro's will stay engaged.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As fdr said just a few posts ago, this accident and investigation has "international importance" and the 787 is a "globally important aircraft type." Big aviation accidents do indeed capture the public's imagination, because they provoke [insert title of risque novel by Erica Jong, circa 1974], because they negatively affect a cross-section of people in the places connected by the flight in question, and because governments generally take them quite seriously. The junk-posters would be wise (though when hell freezes over) to recall that the people who care the most about getting the right answers through the investigation are the . . . . professional pilots.

  At this time I think whether or not the 787 fleet will be subjected to a grounding order is indeterminate. The recorder units have been available for enough time so that it is reasonable to believe the fundamental "what" of the accident has been identified, even though the "how" and "why" will require more information than will be found in the recorders. I don't think the status of this component of the investigation points one way or the other to a grounding order.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the fact that the very highly authoritative poster fdr has anticipated a grounding order, and if I understood the very succinct (adjacent) post by another such authoritative person, PJ2 also anticipates it .... while I do not claim to understand their reasoning or the aeronautical or systems information on which it is based, but despite anything else I'm not going to disagree.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several prior instances have been referenced. The deferral of a grounding order following Lion Air 610 strikes me as part of the overall MCAS debacle; regulatory capture, "narrative management" by the OEM. This accident has happened in a considerably different context. The previous grounding order that gives some concern is the one issued after American 191.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Not the order itself. Rather, after the non-U.S. operators had inspected their fleets and were able to report whether or not any engine-attachment structures (I don't want to get it wrong so I'm not specifically referring to "pylon" or "bolt" etc.) were damaged, they sought lifting of the order. The FAA Administrator kept it in place. The non-U.S. operators sued in federal court, arguing (at hopefully only slight over-simplification) that the U.S. was obligated by international convention to accept the airworthiness certificates of the other States in which those operators were legally organized. They won their case, too. . . . .
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But at the time British Caledonian among other non-U.S. operators challenged the FAA Admin. to lift the grounding order, were any of those non-U.S. operators aware only of the proper maintenance condition of their engines' attachments, or were they also aware of the change in the aerodynamic qualities of the aircraft resulting from the asymmetric slats caused, in turn, by the severance of the hydraulics? If they did not yet know about the fact that the asymmetric slats caused the stall speed to increase, then their airworthiness certificates should not have been given legal deference. (If anyone knows the state of knowledge of the non-U.S. operators when they first challenged the FAA's grounding order, any information (or reprimand either for my lack of knowledge or thread drift) via PM will be greatly appreciated.)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  So if the 787 fleet is in fact subjected to a grounding order, one hopes that the conditions for lifting it will be determined with great clarity. Not to drift over the edge, but the MAX order and its lifting might not give great confidence on this point.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Related to all this is the suggestion, way upthread, that Annex 13 is no longer fit for purpose. Respectfully stated, but I disagree. What would be proposed to update it? Until this tragic accident is resolved, what prospect is there to engage Member States (of ICAO) plus all the credentialed observer organizations in the process to rewrite it? Also, since Sully changed retirement careers the U.S. has not had a Permanent Rep to ICAO (let alone one confirmed by the Senate for Ambassador rank).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  What about keeping the investigation process and results insulated from the pressures for drawing into the litigation process? Early disclosures of partial information would tend to erode that insulation - and for what gain?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The phrase by Icarus (post at 09:25) is one I would like to borrow - though giving attribution to an anonymous callsign could get tricky . . . . "narrative management, damage control, and pass the liability parcel."

      That the

      reports, clearly based on information from official Indian sources, that loss of thrust in both engines was a key factor in this crash, and that DGCA has ordered urgent inspections of 787s because of preliminary findings of the investigation, is important news from one of the most responsible newspapers anywhere. And Juan Browne's urging quick action and citing the importance to the entire fleet and to aviation generally is also significant. He's a respected aviator many here pay serious attention to.

     well, the first violation of the process. All accredited parties agree to non-disclosure and ONLY the IIC can make public statements.

  SLF/attorney here, and staying in (what I hope will be seen as) very narrow limits for posting here.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Disclosures of information by unofficial sources during on-going Annex 13 investigations would not seem to be unusual - not to excuse the occurence. If I'm reading OldnGrounded's post (at 10:04) correctly, it isn't really unexpected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I went back and reread the AvH report from which gear lever's post (at 4:27; AvH link at 4:43) was taken. Yes, AvH misidentifies an ELT. But consider: the content of the unofficially-sourced statement about the CVR-type portion of the forward recorder does not appear to have indicia of unreliability. To the contrary, as other posters have pointed out, by now the CVR-type portion of the recorder would have been read in all likelihood. Further, the rest of the June 17th unofficially-sourced statement aligns with the absence of any emergency ADs, or at least most all of that statement aligns that way. As for how the unofficial source was described, well of course that description would be vague or ambiguous - for one thing, the AvH wants to keep its source inside the flow of events and information.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As long as this post already is risking intrusion on the serious aviation-community discussion going on, I'll just add that the mods are to be greatly appreciated for many more forum hours into the future, for their incessant attention to the threads. Thank you!

     One would hope, but, whilst there has been confirmation that the EAFRs have been recovered, nothing has been reported about their state or whether they have been downloaded or examined.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     If the data is readable there may be a lot of politics and reputation on how that data may be interpreted. Behind the veneer of international cooperation vested interests will be being considered, advocated and agreed.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     It, unfortunately, is naive to think that politics will not have a silent presence in agreeing a press release. Boeing and GE are flagship USA companies. Air India is the flagship carrier of India.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Investigations of all types first establish what happened, then how and why, before recommendations and actions. There is a possibility that they know the what, but the how and why incur liability.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Nothing has been
  <i>
   officially
  </i>
  reported. Perhaps down the timeline it will emerge that AvH made a bet about publishing unofficial statements which later are revealed falsified or even just erroneous.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the closed thread, someone posted that soon the investigation will become immersed in "narrative management, damage control and pass the liability parcel." That's a good way to think about it, but maybe too good. And this post won't use the word that rhymes with shmolitics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a major aircraft accident such as this, several different hard-hitting law firms and attorneys who specialize in representing families of people who lose their lives in such accidents will be out in force. This will happen, even without knowing the outcome of the investigation and its analysis. But two factors (among possibly others) make the potential significance of the "games being played" now less than we might initially surmise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first is that regardless of the outcome, every significant potential defendant will become an actual defendant. I'm not saying to expect the ANSP in India to become a defendant, but certainly the three corporate entities will (and I mean no offense by stating this obvious point, but any unseen manuevering will turn out pointless if the object is to avoid being sued).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The second is that the results of the investigation will not be allowed as evidence in court, at least in the United States; I have to admit I'm not positive about whether the principle in International Air Law that accident investigation reports do not constitute evidence in court proceedings is actually observed in other countries. I believe it is observed, but I stand to be corrected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I have tried to organize and phrase this post in such a manner as not to offend the grief and dignity of those in shocked mourning over the loss of loved ones. The post merely seeks to offer comment on the possible impacts of the delay, or apparent delay, in officially sourced updates and information about the tragic fate of Air India Flight 171, Ahmedabad.

     A case in point is the 2013 Boeing 787 battery fires. After two thermal runaways in 52 000 flight-hours, the root cause was still unknown; however, the FAA nevertheless issued Emergency AD 2013-02-51 grounding every 787 until a modification was available. IMHO a risk where the outcome is catastrophic, even very low probability, would trigger the FAA to issue an Emergency Airworthiness Directive as per their policy.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     As I said in a previous post, every day that passes without a EAD suggest the cause was was specific to that aircraft (fuel contamination, maintenance failure, crew error - pick you own theory)
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Additionally, the lithium-ion batteries in the 787 design required compliance with "Special Conditions" in order to gain type certification. The addition of the Special Conditions at least strongly suggests that FAA's certification process brain-trust had maintained some vigilance with regard to the batteries once the type started operating, i.e., given their newness.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At this time, the fault or flaw at the root of this accident and how that fault or flaw worked through aircraft components and systems has not been identified publicly. It might not even have been identified .... I'm not convinced that separating "what" from "how and why" as a semantics exercise is enough to conclude the Annex 13 officials know the root cause yet. Maybe they do, maybe not.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And if they do not, then the contrast with the situation where FAA was, it seemed, keeping a close eye on battery issues in particular, is relevant.

  The June 30, 2025 edition of Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology (reviewed from an email with "Editors' Picks" sent to subscribers) includes an article dated June 27 by Sean Broderick, about the investigation of Air India 171. It relates some new facts or factual infomration (as well as coverage of many facts in the public domain for some time already).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One theme of the article is that the timing of release of information, in general about the investigation and specifically about data discovered in the recorder(s), appears inconsistent with other facts about the investigation. In support of this theme, the AW&amp;ST article quotes a former NTSB investigator (with specific aircraft accident investigation experience).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The article also refers to the progress of work at the accident site (including an estimate of the number of workers involved) and the presence of aircraft accident investigation professionals from highly experienced authorities and entities (U.S. NTSB, U.K. AIB, Boieng, GE). It is pointed out - certainly with respect and diplomatic tone - that the aircraft accident investigation authority of India has relatively less experience in such matters. And that the presence of more experienced participants in the investigation (as accredited representatives, if I hopefully recall study of Annex 13 correctly) would suggest that guidance to the India authority has been available.

  As the foregoing suggests the article asserts, in a thematic sense, that the timing of information release is not consistent with factual information about the investigation. (It also generally suggests that information typically is released by investigation authorities earlier within the initial 30-day time period provided for by Annex 13 .... but that generalization, while true in some cases, isn't backed up with anything specific of a factual nature.)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mods, I hope this adds to the thread and if not please don't miss the bin when it gets tossed.

  Regarding benefit of the doubt being warranted: While I agree, the more important point is the AW&amp;ST writer probably would also agree. The message the article centers upon is that the relevance of, or need for, giving benefit of the doubt appears substantial. In that sense, the writer makes the same point as "This is probably the first 'really big' accident investigation they have done that has achieved so much international attention" - and citing that there have been three "fatal airline accident[s] in the country since 2000".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among other facts supporting both the theme of article and the propriety of allowing benefit of the doubt, as the article notes, "Unlike their counterparts from Europe and the U.S., AAIB experts are not regularly dispatched as technical advisors in foreign investigations involving products built and certified at home."

  Considering the difficulties so far in determining cause(s) of this accident and the relatively scant infromation released by the investigating authorities, this news item about actions by the DGCA, which could turn out to be relevant, caught my eye. It was published in Aviation Daily, June 25, with a by-line of a senior air transport editor at AW&amp;ST.

    Indian aviation authorities have discovered a list of discrepancies while conducting an assessment of safety measures in the Indian aviation industry.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Two teams from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) carried out surveillance during night and early morning hours at major airports, including those in Delhi and Mumbai. The surveillance order was issued on June 19, and the DGCA summarized its findings in a June 24 statement.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The assessment covered a wide range of areas such as flight operations, airworthiness, ramp safety, air traffic control, pre-flight medical evaluations and communication, navigation and surveillance systems. As part of this process, &ldquo;ground activities and aircraft movements were closely monitored to check the compliance [with] regulatory requirements and to identify weak areas for improvement,&rdquo; the DGCA said.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In one of the more notable findings, the DGCA observed multiple cases where &ldquo;reported defects reappeared many times on the aircraft indicating the ineffective monitoring and inadequate rectification action.&rdquo; However, the DGCA did not reveal details of the incidents, or the airline or aircraft involved.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Maintenance regulations or procedures were not followed correctly in some instances. Airport issues involved runway markings and lighting, ground vehicles and obstruction data.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    All of the findings have been communicated to the operators concerned, and they must take corrective actions within seven days, the DGCA said. &ldquo;This process of comprehensive surveillance will continue in the future to detect hazards in the system,&rdquo; the agency said.

     With all due respect, do you have any idea how a large scale investigation of this kind actually works, because it would appear not so much.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Not only are there agencies and personnel from outside governmental influence directly involved in the investigation, and playing an active as well as observational role, which makes it almost impossible to hide or obscure critical pieces of information or data, but other than a frenzy of any-nonsense-goes in the name of hits, clicks and ad revenue, the media play no role whatsoever in any part of the investigation.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The team itself will operate largely within a bubble, and team members don't talk to media or politicians - however much the media or politicians still need to flap their jaws because to both classes, silence is anathema. Furthermore, everyone who does this kind of work is a professional, well aware that any unofficial commentary is capable of severely compromising the investigation and other members of the team. Just as pilots who fly these aircraft are professionals with a hard job deserving of respect, so are those who investigate when things go wrong.

  Annex 13 is held in high regard among attorneys practicing in international civil aviation legal matters. And by other types of professionals as well. So it was in a sense validating to read, in a number of posts way upthread, about the strict confidentiality obligations imposed on the individuals conducting or otherwise participating in the investigation. Also validating (in the same sense) to read the quoted post by za9ra22.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Without so much as hinting at approving of unauthorized leaks of information or statements purporting to be information from or about the investigation, the context which this accident has yielded is important. The first accident involving this type, and the different design fundamentals of the type (heavier use of electrical systems), would make any investigation authority especially careful not to issue incorrect statements. Perhaps the AAIB in India could be credited with understanding the high regard in which Annex 13 is held, and wanting, ..... perhaps desperately wanting, not to screw this up, not only in general terms but especially given the context. And add in the seemingly mystifying answers to what happened to Flight 171. If Annex 13 had a sentient presence, I'm convinced (mere SLF and attorney as I am) that it would concur with a "be careful, be very careful" approach to anything outside the tight circle of confidentiality within which the investigation occurs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When I saw the article in The Air Current, on one hand I hoped for the sake of the reputation of the publisher that the unnamed sources were legitimately informed, but at the same time, would not anyone legitimately informed have been subject to rather strict confidentiality and nondisclosure obligations?
