     Ive been away from aviation a while now, but the level of information available almost immediately after drew me back in here.

  Yes. But the level of information also is (unfortunately) often laced with misinformation, it being the year 2025.

     This truly is an awful thread with some utter rubbish being spouted. Please wait for some expert analysis to be released and stop making up ever more elaborate scenarios. It&rsquo;s a sad event, let&rsquo;s wait for the report

  This is a common complaint here at PPRuNe, has been since it began. (And I empathize with your position).

  One of the best things that our Professional and Knowledgeable members can to is point out errors (or nonsense) as it is encountered, or report posts that are well beyond the pale.

  General point:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is not uncommon that on social media, and in the press, we see sciolists pop up when a plane crash occurs.

    Background
    <br/>
    In-service reports have been received from operators of the affected airplanes where the AFDS altitude hold ALT hold mode was erroneously engaged during takeoff. One recent event resulted in an unusually low initial rate of climb. Another recent event resulted in a slight descent after takeoff, triggering a ground proximity warning system (GPWS) &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Sink&rdquo; caution message. Once airborne, the flightcrews pushed the Take Off/Go Around (TO/GA) switch to restore proper pitch guidance. Review of flight data from the reported events showed the activation of ALT pitch mode prior to takeoff without the crew&rsquo;s recognition.
    <br/>
    --fast forward
    <br/>
    For 787s:
    <br/>
    ï‚· Inadvertent selection of the Altitude Hold Switch on the MCP.
    <br/>
    ï‚· Inadvertent selection of the FLCH, VS/FPA when the MCP selected altitude is within 20
    <br/>
    feet of the displayed barometric altitude.
    <br/>
    ï‚· The Flight Director is ON with the Inertial Reference System (IRS) OFF (including during
    <br/>
    initiation of IRS alignment), and the MCP selected altitude is within 20 feet of the
    <br/>
    displayed barometric altitude.
    <br/>
    <br/>
   </div>
  </div>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  {there is more, this is just a taste, see the whole report for details}.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Would any of our 787 qualified pilots care to comment on this as it relates, or doesn't relate, to the aircraft's brief flight shown on the CCTV video?

     That said, what I did was for the past 7 days of this flight - i.e. 787s travelling to Gatwick I downloaded the raw .CSV data for each flight. From that I took the first sample with an altitude of &gt;0 i.e. the first point that the flight looked to be airborne. On my picture (which I've tried to show in 3D as far as possible), these are labelled as 1-1, 2-1, 3-1 etc and orange. As I don't have enough posts to include the visualisation, here it is:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     postimg.cc/gLW8zXDg
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The flight from today is in red with a larger marker. As you can see, it appears to be in the same position in space as every other flight this week at the same point in time (with all the caveats above). It did, however, have a ground speed approx. 10knts less than any other flight this week. Is that significant? I don't know. It certainly isn't airspeed anyway, so may not mean much.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I will suggest that you relabel your red pin as 12th June rather than 12th July.
  <img alt="" border="0" class="inlineimg" src="https://www.pprune.org/images/smilies/wink2.gif" title="Wink"/>

  (Interesting picture that you painted, in comparing to similar events using a similar data baseline).

     Ok why was the gear still down. Under all circumstances that comes up with positive rate. Can&rsquo;t see the flaps but sure looks like they were retracted instead of gear coming up.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     engine failure. Sure that would suck lift out but all parameters take thay into effect with the proper flap setting. And you can&rsquo;t take off without the right flap setting per the performance data unless you ignore it.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Loss of lift. VNAV engages at 400 ft and targets airspeed in MCP.

  I empathize with your frustration, and you have no idea how much has already been scrubbed.

  There are some wise engineers, ATC pros, and GE/RR experts who are not pilots but who do post here, and whom we'll not bar from discussion.

  Do you understand why?

     As fdr said just a few posts ago, this accident and investigation has "international importance" and the 787 is a "globally important aircraft type."
     <br/>
     Big aviation accidents do indeed capture the public's imagination, because they provoke [insert title of risque novel by Erica Jong, circa 1974], because they negatively affect a cross-section of people in the places connected by the flight in question, and because governments generally take them quite seriously.
     <br/>
     The junk-posters would be wise (though when hell freezes over) to recall that the people who care the most about getting the right answers through the investigation are the . . . . professional pilots.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I got the reference and laughed, because I read that book.
  <br/>
  The PPs prefer radio comms that are more signal than noise, so of course objections will be raised when the noise level increases.

   Since there isn't any actual evidence of willful pilot action to deliberately crash this aircraft, I will ask you all to please cease and desist with posts along those lines.
   <br/>
   I have discussed this with some of the mod and admin team.
   <br/>
   For the time being such speculation isn't just premature, it is potentially slanderous to our colleagues who died in this crash.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   I understand why some wish to air that inference. Please show our deceased colleagues your ability to exercise patience.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   If evidence of such comes to light then obviously the state of play changes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   If you compare this crash to the one recently in China (that a few of you have referred to), in that case there was a flight path trajectory that really stood out. In this case, there is no such flight path trajectory that leaps out at you as being wildly out of the norm. The apparent loss of power in this case, that has been discussed at great length, has been shown to have a variety of possible initiating causes or event chains.  In time other information may come to light that reveals an as- yet-unguessed anomaly that none of the brain trust of PPRuNe has come up with.

    Reading a few posts about an APU-to-pack takeoff, or a packs off takeoff on a 787, because of the hot weather, makes me shake my head.
    <br/>
    There is no bleed air on the 787. A packs off takeoff, or an apu to pack takeoff, is never done. There isn&rsquo;t a procedure in the fcom to describe it. It is also pointless. The packs are electrical.

     BOTH engines are

  </div>
  Presumed or reported? If the latter, by whom?
  <br/>
  I do not intend to single you out, but I want to illustrate something with this response.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A lot of discussion on this thread has pointed toward two engines failing - or losing power - for a variety of reasons.
  <br/>
  PPRuNe members are analysing and discussing this tragedy.
  <br/>
  When a credible report comes out that says
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
   "Based on FDR data, the two donks quit at {such and such a time} and {x event} associated with this indicates that they {failed or shut down} by time {XX:XX:XX}"
  </div>
  you, or we, can say that engines were shut down or failed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Using unconfirmed news reports, social media, or PPruNe analysis as a basis of "fact" is hazardous.
  <br/>
  A number of posters succumbed to this: see the obsession over white and green lights at the exit door (near seat 11A) as but one example.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As an aside: your EFATO story might be of interest on the Mil Av forum.

  In that poster's defense, you will find that they joined PPRuNe in 2002, and their original profile entry was 767.

  The upgrade to 777 between then and now is within reason.

  SP closed it when it had run amok.

  If it does so again, it will be doubtless be closed for a breather.

  Two things that it is hard to get information about, but that aviation industry professionals all have concerns about as expressed in the previous thread:
  <br/>
  1. Unscheduled Maintenance
  <br/>
  2. Scheduled Maintenance
  <br/>
  <br/>
  (1) Based on a passenger's comments on line, a variety of things - passenger side - weren't working as expected. How many other things that "needed attention" could be worked on in the interval between arrival from the previous flight and the takeoff that ended up in the tragic crash?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  (2) Based on some discussions by our posters of some known issues with software that have a time tag on them, interest has been displayed in whether or not those ADs and "known issues" had been taken care of by Air India.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Good questions, for the investigators, but hard to answer on PPRuNe at this point since there has probably been a hard lock down by Air India on their maintenance records. They have an investigation ongoing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The kind of information that people were/are asking about may or may not be leaked. In some previous accidents there have been some cases of that info coming to light outside of official protocols.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But expecting that may be a step too far.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I am sure that the investigators will ask those kinds of questions, and if we are patient those kinds of questions will eventually be answered.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thank you all for your continued interest. Let's keep it Professional.

     There are several videos of the survivor being interviewed in India, all of them as one might expect, in the language of the country, with English subtitles. As Mr Ramesh is a British national, many years in the UK, I did wonder if there have been any interviews in English, in which I expect he is fluent.

    In jet aircraft how many systems related dual engine flameouts have occurred at low altitude ? Excluding FOD &mdash; birds and ice (which presumably aren&rsquo;t a factor here) how many systems caused dual engine flameouts have occurred ?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As opposed to how many engine failures, thrust losses, or shutdowns have been caused by crew members grabbing at improper levers under stress or setting wrong data (I&rsquo;ll include Air Florida in that).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Not meant to be self - indicting by any means but if one is looking at probabilities and far-fetched scenarios
    <b>
     you can&rsquo;t exclude crew actions as a part of that
    </b>
    .
   </div>
  </div>
  I don't think anyone intends to do that.
  <br/>
  I felt that the (valid) objection was to the problem of stating as a fact that which is an estimate or a guess.

  I was offered a link to an official report (allegedly by the AAIB in India) this morning from a retired pilot friend: he said it was dated 15 June 2025.
  <br/>
  I checked the official site and found nothing. I went to his link and got a 404 result.
  <br/>
  Even professionals (he's only been retired a couple of years) can be taken in by the avalanche of "information" running around.
