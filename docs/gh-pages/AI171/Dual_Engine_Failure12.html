     Nobody seems to have discussed this. If I'm reading it right (and I'm not a pilot), it seems to be suggesting that in the event of a dual engine failure, a restart should be attempted while the engine still has high RPM?
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  That's how I read this:

  <br/>
  <br/>
  Obviously, because it's going to require quick action to catch high RPM. And maybe that's what they tried.

  Not sure about this. I think it's saying Resetting to initiate a Restart attempt. Not repeating it.

  A couple of points if I may......
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I don't see it written in the 787 FCOM but I have always been told that the action of resetting the Engine Cutoff switches in the event of a dual engine failure, is merely backing up what the FADECs have already done.  If there is an 'engine event' the FADECs will manage ignition and fuel-flow to restore the thrust that was demanded before the event.  If that management has failed then the manual resetting may be more successful.  (The same holds true for the RAT, manual selection is merely backing up the auto-deployment).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Any airline pilot will tell you that executing an in-flight relight on a big engine, no matter if it is by electric start, windmilling RPM or cross-bleed assisted, can take between 1 and 3 minutes to restore power.  This aircraft was airborne for less that 30 seconds.  No pilot in his right mind would prioritise an in-flight relight procedure, in a situation where they had neither the time, the height nor the speed for it to succeed.  I have no doubt the crew focussed entirely on pointing the aircraft at the clearest area they could see, to mitigate what would inevitably follow.

     The data recorder has all the information most are questioning. They already know if the fuel control switches were selected to cutoff and they know if this happened before or after the loss of thrust. Perhaps the sequence of events will be more clear tomorrow. I can tell you that from aircraft rotation to loss of thrust was a very short time period. Perhaps 8 seconds. I simply won&rsquo;t believe in that time period the crew were taking any non deliberate actions that would have shut the motors down.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Assuming the 2nd/3rd-hand 'leaked' info about fuel switches is even accurate the scenarios of what they know (investigators / leaker) would be:
  <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
   <li>
    They know exactly 1 fuel switch was cut off, perhaps implying single engine failure + wrong engine shutdown
   </li>
   <li>
    They know 1 or both switches were cycled off then on, implying a last-ditch attempt at some sort reset at any point up to say ~30s
   </li>
   <li>
    They know both fuel switches were cut off, and remained off, implying sabotage
   </li>
  </ol>
  Working logically through these:
  <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
   <li>
    If the cut off happened within 20s of leaving the ground perhaps it could explain why CCTV shows the initial climb then level for ~10s before descent. It could also explain the RAT and gear trucks perhaps if gear up was delayed? However, in this scenario they must know that the engine failed, that information would be clearly recorded and surely the leak would lead with that info? Also 'switches' is plural implying both, the radio call didn't mention single engine failure and like you say its quite hasty, even within 20s.
   </li>
   <li>
    Again assuming switches plural, this implies either of the prevailing theories of dual engine failure leading to loss of AC or loss of AC leading to reduced thrust or engine failure. However, it also seems strange to lead with that info rather than the state of the engines or electrical systems in any flight data, unless someone can explain how the data would be impacted?
   </li>
   <li>
    If this was the case then it would imply that there is no voice or engine data to explain the cut off, nothing was said and the engines were normal up until that point
   </li>
  </ol>

      So, we have a Memory Drill with a non-numbered thing you have to remember first, being sub-idle, and an FCTM that pumps the idea of getting those switches off and on ASAP, before the revs drop off too much, at any speed or altitude.

  ...... As you should be aware as an 'apparent' professional pilot, the handling of abnormal situations requires an informed decision to action an appropriate checklist, at an appropriate time.  Any professional would be able to see that.  Boeing training teaches that throughout.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Notwithstanding what it says in the B787 FCOM and FCTM, I don't think Boeing ever envisaged the dual engine failure procedure being required 10 seconds after rotate.  There are many pilots in civil aviation who live and die by what is written in the manuals without thinking past the text.  There are times when what is written is sensible and appropriate, and there are times when application is just plain daft.  This is why a man is in charge, not a machine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For those thinking about a SEF followed by an incorrect shutdown.....  In the event of a SEF you control the aircraft, take the gear up and engage the autopilot.  You then sit on your hands until 400' AGL.  If an engine is on fire - You let it burn until 400'.  No procedure is actioned until the problem is confirmed between you, and you are safely climbing away.  To deviate from that would be very unprofessional and highly dangerous.

  I think the correct Boeing reply would be: "it is not part of the certification process". So yes, loss of thrust on both engines during the takeoff phase is not really countered for in the procedures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That does not mean that the pilots "out of habit" would have reverted to the procedure. Who would not? But in that case, the fuel control switches would be found in the RUN position post crash (if anything was left). So did they find the switches in the cutoff position, or did the action of switching got "stored" somewhere in FDM (not a specialist on these things, only to hear many times in the past that "maintenance is already aware" if we had an issue and called maintenance post flight)

    As per the EAFR, the Engine 1 fuel cutoff switch transitioned from CUTOFF to RUN at about
   </i>
   <i>
    08:08:52 UTC. The APU Inlet Door began opening at about 08:08:54 UTC, consistent with the APU Auto Start logic. Thereafter at 08:08:56 UTC the Engine 2 fuel cutoff switch also transitions from CUTOFF to RUN. When fuel control switches are moved from CUTOFF to RUN while the aircraft is inflight, each engines full authority dual engine control (FADEC) automatically manages a relight and thrust recovery sequence of ignition and fuel introduction. The EGT was observed to be rising for both engines indicating relight.
    <b>
     Engine 1's core deceleration stopped, reversed and started to progress to recovery.
    </b>
    Engine 2 was able to relight but could not arrest core speed deceleration and re-introduced fuel repeatedly to increase core speed acceleration and recovery. The EAFR recording stopped at 08:09:11 UTC.

  That was with 10 seconds delay vs. 13 seconds for engine 2.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Time was spent with the verbal exchange, and then perhaps each pilot expected the other to put the switch back?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anyway, the preliminary report also establishes that the aircraft had only 3-4 seconds of powered flight. (Would the gear lever be operated that early?) Everyone who saw that from the CCTV video, pat yourselves on the back.

  Mayday call, dual engine failure, RAT deployment all confirmed.

  TCMA was a red herring, the aircraft was firmly in air mode as the accident unfolded, and the thrust levers were at takeoff thrust the whole time.

  For those sky gods who confidently state they would reset the cutoff switches immediately I would say that 10 seconds is not a particularly unusual time for startle effect to impair cognition, especially for something as monumental and unexpected as a dual engine failure at rotation. One reference amongst many:
  <a href="https://www.icao.int/Meetings/LOCI/Presentations/Managing%20Startle%20Individual%20Crew%20and%20Organizational%20Strategies.pdf" target="_blank">
   https://www.icao.int/Meetings/LOCI/P...Strategies.pdf
  </a>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And for those who scoff at the possibility of the PM inadvertently operating the cutoff switches (which is done as frequently as operating the gear lever), I\x92d remind you that more than one Airbus has landed with its parking brake on after the PM inadvertently set it rather than arming the spoilers.

     3 seconds after liftoff, you're not doing anything with you're hands. You probably haven't even given the positive rate/climb call that early in the take-off phase.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Again I agree with you, 3 seconds is about right for positive rate, I would be starting to lean over toward the gear handle about then. So did the start switches manually move to shutoff or not, if not then, they must have been manually cycled off to run 10 seconds later and what raised the "why did you" query, wouldn't that query be "dual engine failure"
