     Why are we concentrating on the engine switches .?
     <br/>
     What happened before this to cause the engines to run down, resulting in the crew trying the documented procedure of turning the switches off then on to restart ?.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  There are no documented procedures to that effect during takeoff\x85\x85\x85

     With the mention of the Stabiliser error message on the previous flight could there have been maintenance on the STAB switches which could have disrupted the Fuel cut off switches?

     left me wondering the same thing. It give a procedure for detecting the defect but omits to explain the cause. I was thinking that the wrong switches had been supplied/fitted. Assuming the image from the Chinese web site is correct, it is disappointing that the actuator can get into that state. I did not see anything that said whether that was how the switch arrived from Honeywell or if there was a defect that allowed the actuator to turn.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     One other useful thing from that web site is a partial schematic which shows the connection of the 4 poles in the switch. I believe this is from a 737NG but it should be the same idea.
     <br/>

  Why are you wasting your own time?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If any of that were true why would it happen after Vr and why would one pilot ask: \x93why did you go to cutoff\x94. That is an observed deliberate action. Cmon folks enough with the nonsense!
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Why are people shying around the truth!?

     Having studied human factors, that's not what I would call a switch guard. This is what I would call a guard:

  Having studied HF, how many flights since the beginning of time have BOTH of those switches been inadvertently moved during takeoff? If that number is 1 or less you were probably better off studying statistics.

     There is a lot of grasping at straws in this thread. It seems pretty simple to me and only one explanation that fits the evidence. About three seconds after takeoff the Captain noted the FO turn of the fuel cutoff switches. He immediately questioned that for obvious reasons and the FO replied he did not again for reasons that seem obvious to me. He did not want it on the tape and he wanted to delay the Captain in trying to switch them back on. Had the fuel cutoff switches been restored immediately before the engines unspooled the accident would have been avoided. In addition the timing of the cutoff switches movement is exactly what you would expect if the copilot was using one hand trying to be discreet in his actions.

  Finally! A sensible and very probable cause. Bravo.

      This might have been discussed but as has been suggested upthread; a possible scenario is that at some point, PIC took their hands off the thrust levers and/or placed them in a guarding position behind the thrust levers at their base - but by doing so unfortunately nudged the Run switches to 'Off' - perhaps 'helped' by there either being incorrectly fitted locking mechanisms or worn locking mechanisms ?
     </span>
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  No one\x92s hands should be anywhere near the thrust levers after V1\x85\x85

     FO was flying. If moving switches happened, it's likely the Captain did it.

  Correct. The delay in getting the switches back to run would also fit as he\x92d have been flying the aircraft at a critical time whilst trying to find/ reach the switches.
