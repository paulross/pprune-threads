     User989 thanks for a nice summary
     <br/>
     I am at risk of turning into one of those folks who gets their mind locked on one possibility and keeps banging on about it but here goes;
     <br/>
     <br/>
     If the authorities determined that the accident aircraft had been treated by maintenance for microbial growth in the fuel tanks within the last week or so, and they suspected that that procedure was carried out in a way that could result in fuel contamination, then that would explain
     <br/>
     <br/>
     1/ No other aircraft being affected
     <br/>
     2/ No measures taken at the airport
     <br/>
     3/ No AD\x92s from the regulators
     <br/>
     4/ No grounding of 787\x92s
     <br/>
     5/ Flight profile
     <br/>
     6/ Rat deployment etc etc
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I agree with your statement that dual flameout due fuel contamination is very unlikely, but we ARE dealing with something that is very unlikely. I favour the theory because an error in treating the fuel is so predictably human and simple, and a dual engine failure being related to fuel is also a simple and obvious idea, and it satisfies all we know both about the aircraft\x92s behaviour, and the authorities behaviour post accident.
     <br/>
     I posted a report earlier of a 787-8 powered by the same engine type have both engines roll back sub-idle within a minute of each other while airborne due to this, so we know it can happen in theory.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Now\x85\x85I want to be clear that I\x92m not saying I think I know what happened, I\x92m an average Joe with my hands full just flying the line, but I am a bit surprised that the idea of \x91fuel contamination specific to that airframe\x92 doesn\x92t get discussed more on this thread.
     <br/>
     Thanks again for the clear summary of discussion thus far.
    </div>

  Fuel guy here. I've been "sitting on my hands" as requested by the mods but I will bite on that. Because dual engine failure is a "common mode fault" contamination is one of simplest explanations. Forget wax, think sediment, water or misfuelling. The only reason this has been discounted in favour of an electromechanical/software fault is that there is no yaw, i.e. both engines ran down at the same time at more or less the same rate, and would have to have been fed from the same tank (so the contaminated fuel reaches the engines at EXACTLY the same time on each side - is that even possible?). Its a stretch but I suppose it is possible, however the retention samples should have been tested by now. I would be interested in confirmation that they were taken and tested. I would also want to know if there is a "hot hydrant" system at AMD or if there are bowsers and if any maintenance had been done (think Cathay at Surabaya). But honestly, the fuel supply chain is usually rigorous...[edit: I have just seen a Reddit post pointing to a major construction project involving the fuelling facilities at Ahmedabad...will try to find out more...]

  What happens to TCMA sensors like Weight on Wheels? Radio altimeter? Is there one Weight on Wheels per engine? Is there one radio altimeter per engine? If not, why not? Are the TCMA sensors directly powered as part of FADEC? If not, why not?
  <br/>
  Is it possible that there was a noticeable loss of thrust caused by loss of fuel pumps and the pilot responded by cycling thrust to zero and back, trying to clear the problem, inadvertently triggering the TCMA?

  We know the engines lost power in the initial climb, shortly after rotation.  If there was water sitting between the tank lower skin stringers, the rotation would have been the point that the water could tumble over the stringers that were previously preventing its movement. accumulate at the back of the tank and enter both pumps more or less simultaneously.

  For background, I worked at Smiths Industries wet fuel testing the B777 gauging system on ground rigs, and at Airbus building and testing fuel tank inerting rigs.  I've seen inside Airbus tanks, but not Boeing.

  I had been wondering the same until I read that there is a forward and a rear pickup within the tank. Each pump in the centre tank draws from it's own pickup and is piped to the spar valves and then onto the engines.

  In a well designed boat, you'd have each engine feeding from a different tank for the utmost in redundancy, but seemingly not so in all aircraft.

  Interestingly enough on Airbus aircraft even when there\x92s fuel in the centre tank the centre tank fuel pumps are switched off automatically after the flaps are extended for takeoff and each engine is fed by its respective wing tank for takeoff. Surprised it\x92s not the case for Boeings

  Don't get me wrong, I'm not suggesting for even a moment that Boeing don't do the same thing; I have no idea.  I was merely pointing out how the centre tank feeds when it does.

  Aside from separating the two engines' respective sources of fuel, the Airbus approach also ensures that the pilots can't inadvertently select a centre tank for take off that is empty, or near empty, for a short sector.

  Hello, this is my first post on pprune; as a 787 pilot I&rsquo;m also puzzled by this accident. All seem to agree that for some reason there was a complete electrical failure and RAT deployment. With a complete electrical failure all six main fuel pumps fail. Each engine also has two mechanically driven fuel pumps. On takeoff, if there is fuel in the center tank, it will be used first, pumped by the two center tank pumps.
  <br/>
  My airline&rsquo;s manuals don&rsquo;t go into much detail, but I read on another site that if both the center tank pumps fail, the engine driven pumps aren&rsquo;t able to suction feed well enough from the center tanks to sustain engine operation. If there was fuel in the center tanks, a complete electrical failure would soon lead to center tank fuel pumps failure (all fuel pumps failure as stated previously) and fuel starvation of both engines. A rescue from this situation would be an immediate selection of both center tank fuel pumps OFF (not if my airline&rsquo;s non-normal checklists) and waiting for successful suction feed from the L and R main tanks to occur, this would take a number of seconds.

     Hello, this is my first post on pprune; as a 787 pilot I\x92m also puzzled by this accident. All seem to agree that for some reason there was a complete electrical failure and RAT deployment. With a complete electrical failure all six main fuel pumps fail. Each engine also has two mechanically driven fuel pumps. On takeoff, if there is fuel in the center tank, it will be used first, pumped by the two center tank pumps.
     <br/>
     My airline\x92s manuals don\x92t go into much detail, but I read on another site that if both the center tank pumps fail, the engine driven pumps aren\x92t able to suction feed well enough from the center tanks to sustain engine operation. If there was fuel in the center tanks, a complete electrical failure would soon lead to center tank fuel pumps failure (all fuel pumps failure as stated previously) and fuel starvation of both engines. A rescue from this situation would be an immediate selection of both center tank fuel pumps OFF (not if my airline\x92s non-normal checklists) and waiting for successful suction feed from the L and R main tanks to occur, this would take a number of seconds.

  Great first post (IMMHO!) If this is correct, then I think you are onto something very significant. No expert, just an outside the box thinker who has been trying to see what ordinary (non-pilot-blaming) explanations there could be for a near simultaneous dual engine failure. I imagine a complete electrical failure leading to fuel starvation from lack of pump feed pressure from the centre tank would not result in apparently near simultaneous engine failure, but who knows? (Aren't there (suction) bypass valves here, but maybe they get stuck after long non-opening - instead long subject to closing pressures?)  This could have been the case here as my experience suggests the probabilities aren't small.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  FWIW, according to earlier posts, the fuel load was about 50T, leaving about 18T in the centre tank, so (I think) about 25-30% full. A full centre tank might allow engine pump suction to work fine, but this might not? (Contrary to what some have said.)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anyway, FWIW, not everyone agrees with RAT Deployment - see recent post by shep69. Would love to know why he doesn't go with RAT deployment...

  Sorry but that doesn't really make sense. Once the power failed and all pumps are off where is the point of switching of the center fuel pumps off? Without power they aren't running anyways.
  <br/>
  Furthermore the preference of the center tank while it's filled is just by the higher fuel pressure those center pumps deliver. There is no valve that controls that, which might be triggered by switching off pumps.

  Just for me to understand: How would you shut off the engine driven pumps if there is no electrical connection whatsoever? If there is a "powered" valve, wouldn't this (also) cut fuel suppy in case of a complete electrical failure?

  I am not a Boeing pilot, but a Bus pilot. I believe that what you're describing is prevented by the certification regs for transport category airplanes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the 320 (equipped with the old system (fuel pumps), not the newer system (transfer valves)) the center tank pumps are inhibited when the airplane is airborne with the slats extended.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Check these certification rules:

  Crossky, welcome to this hamster wheel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If you go and chat to the engineers, have a look in the IPC or MM I Ch 28, you should find a good description of the fuel boost pumps. It's been a while but I recall they are Eaton designs, the general arrangement is similar to the B777. They both have a suction feed that permits fuel feed in the event of a loss of all boost pumps. The only impact of that arises at high altitude and high thrust levels, where the engine driven fuel boost pumps may capitate and reduce the available fuel feed resulting in a lower thrust level.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Refer page 12.20.02 in the TBC's B787 FCTM, or search for "SUCTION FEED".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At sea level, full thrust will be achieved without any boost pump on the aircraft. Recall that the CWT boost pumps are known as Override boost pumps, they are feeding from the CWT when there is fuel and they are running, as the output pressure is higher from these pumps than the 2 wing boost pumps. Whether there is fuel in the CWT or not, or the CWT pumps are energised, is immaterial to whether fuel will be supplied to the engine driven fuel pumps.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Note that with BA038, the fundamental problem was blockage of wax/ice formed in the piping that blocked the FOHE, and that will cause a problem with those engines that have such architecture, but is not associated with the availability of the boost pumps themselves. Even then, the engines did not technically fail, as they have both done simultaneously with the B788 of AI 171, BA's engines were running but not able to provide significant thrust due to the FOHE blockages.
  <br/>

  Under a complete electrical failure all electrically powered fuel pumps will fail, but the engine driven mechanical pumps will not fail, but according to information in my manual and what I\x92ve seen online, the engine driven pumps can only suction feed the engines from the main tanks. The 787 will burn fuel from the center tanks first, because they provide a greater pressure than the main fuel tank pumps.

  and there is a discrepancy in the two points he makes below in adjacent posts. Is tdracer talking about the same HPSOV valves? Can anyone confirm that with both AC power loss and and a temporary DC power loss there are no critical engine related shutoff valves that will fail safe (unpowered) in a closed position?

     The engine driven fuel pump is a two-stage pump - a centrifugal pump that draws the fuel into the pump (i.e. 'suction feed'), and a gear pump which provides the high-pressure fuel to the engine and as muscle pressure to drive things like the Stator Vane and Bleed Valve actuators. It takes a minimum of ~300 PSI to run the engine -
     <b>
      the HPSOV is spring loaded closed and it takes approximately 300 psi to overcome that spring
     </b>
     .
     <br/>
     Engine driven fuel pump failures are very rare, but have happened (usually with some 'precursor' symptoms that were ignored or mis-diagnosed by maintenance). It would be unheard of for engine driven fuel pumps to fail on both engines on the same flight.

     <a href="https://www.pprune.org/accidents-close-calls/666581-air-india-ahmedabad-accident-12th-june-2025-part-2-a-2.html#post11903420" target="_blank">

     and there is a discrepancy in the two points he makes below in adjacent posts. Is tdracer talking about the same HPSOV valves? Can anyone confirm that with both AC power loss and and a temporary DC power loss there are no critical engine related shutoff valves that will fail safe (unpowered) in a closed position?

  The spring loaded valve he is talking about is surely behind (in sequence) the engine driven fuel pump. It assures that no fuel is leaking into the engine while the engine isn't running.
  <br/>
  However, it could easily have different modes of operation (closed, electrically actuated), activated (electrically actuated), open (transition from activated + fuel pressure &gt; 300psi).

     Hello, this is my first post on pprune; as a 787 pilot I&rsquo;m also puzzled by this accident. All seem to agree that for some reason there was a complete electrical failure and RAT deployment. With a complete electrical failure all six main fuel pumps fail. Each engine also has two mechanically driven fuel pumps. On takeoff, if there is fuel in the center tank, it will be used first, pumped by the two center tank pumps.
     <br/>
     My airline&rsquo;s manuals don&rsquo;t go into much detail, but I read on another site that if both the center tank pumps fail, the engine driven pumps aren&rsquo;t able to suction feed well enough from the center tanks to sustain engine operation. If there was fuel in the center tanks, a complete electrical failure would soon lead to center tank fuel pumps failure (all fuel pumps failure as stated previously) and fuel starvation of both engines. A rescue from this situation would be an immediate selection of both center tank fuel pumps OFF (not if my airline&rsquo;s non-normal checklists) and waiting for successful suction feed from the L and R main tanks to occur, this would take a number of seconds.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Is this something that you train for in your airline? Am I correct that to do this requires making the needed switch selections on the overhead panel?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Further up the thread one of the posters mentions that it is very unlikely that any crew action (checklist, QRH) would have got anywhere near to changing a fuel pump switch position.

  I would take that post by Crossky with a grain of salt. No part of his post made sense and I can only assume he is not a 787 pilot despite claiming to be. "Fuel starvation if pumps aren't turned off, not in my manual but I read about a procedure on the Internet", it's loony stuff.

  Is correct. As commented by Sailvi767, only after the jet is cleaned-up, away from the ground and ATC sorted out would any "normal" defect that didn't require a Memory/Recall item be attended-to. Now, if both engines stopped 7 seconds after liftoff, that's different; there is no published procedure for that.
