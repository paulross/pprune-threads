  Agreed, it's most unfortunate that that the preliminary report hasn&rsquo;t closed off speculation, it's simply created opportunity for more.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It confirms that both fuel cutoff switches were moved to OFF at Vr, within a one second interval which is as extreme and inexplicable as it gets. Then it gives us a CVR quote that&rsquo;s so neutered, "Why did you cut off?&rdquo; / &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t&rdquo;, that it raises more questions than it answers. If the goal was to reassure or clarify, it&rsquo;s had the opposite effect.

     One item in the report is the position of the LG Lever - Down.
     <br/>
     Given the lack of a full transcript, and in trying to defend the crewmembers
     <i>
      intentions
     </i>
     , Is it possible that at the point of "Positive Rate - Gear Up" - PM Brain farted, and performed a different muscle memory action? Thus they would deny moving the Switches - and take a few seconds to compute what they just did?
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  The landing gear lever is forward and up on the centre instrument panel, adjacent to the PFD. The two fuel control switches are aft and low, on the thrust pedestal. There's no reasonable way to confuse one for the other in terms of position, hand movement or 'muscle memory'.

  The phrasing
  <i>
   &ldquo;Why did you cut off?&rdquo;
  </i>
  doesn&rsquo;t suggest surprise at an EICAS message, it implies direct observation or perception of manual action. This quote from the preliminary report reads exactly like what it appears to be; one pilot reacting to a control input he didn&rsquo;t expect for which there was no plausible explanation .

  It's established fact both fuel control switches moved to CUTOFF 4 seconds after Vr, a deliberate guarded action, not easily done accidentally.
  <br/>
  The CVR records one pilot asking &ldquo;Why did you cut off?&rdquo;, the other replies &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t&rdquo;. Then a bland Mayday attributed to the Captain &ldquo;engine failure, returning&rdquo; in the middle of the crisis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The language, if reported correctly, feels strangely detached. No confusion, no urgency, no clear troubleshooting. Not drawing conclusions, but does anyone else see signs of performative behaviour, that is saying the right things outwardly, while being at odds with the underlying cause?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I appreciate that both crew members lost their lives, however if we avoid discussing uncomfortable patterns, we miss the point of investigation and learning.

  There&rsquo;s a line of argument in some of the discussion around AI171 that gives me pause. Understandably, nobody wants to rush to judgement, especially when the crew can&rsquo;t speak for themselves. But I&rsquo;m concerned we&rsquo;re leaning too far in the opposite direction: treating almost any possibility, even when it stretches beyond reason, other than unintentional error as "off-limits"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I&rsquo;m not suggesting intent. But at some point, professional integrity requires us to ask hard questions. If the evidence points to deliberate human action, whether through disorientation, procedural lapse, or something worse, we can&rsquo;t just explain it away with ambient heat and "muscle memory".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The aircraft didn&rsquo;t crash itself. If we're unwilling to face uncomfortable data, we risk turning investigation into deflection.

  If anyone believes both guarded switches flipped to OFF by accident, one after the other in under a second, I&rsquo;d genuinely like to hear the cockpit ergonomics that make that plausible. Because from where I sit, it doesn&rsquo;t happen unless someone means it, or at minimum, fails to follow any known SOP.

     Agree.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I can&rsquo;t see it being possible with 1 hand. Those switches are not easy to move fast. Pretty sure they are same ones as on 737 Max.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     You would need both hands. Which would mean you aren&rsquo;t even in your seat unless you are in some extreme yoga position within your seat.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  In everyday operations (e.g. shutdown at the gate), pilots often move them with one hand in quick succession. lift guard, toggle switch, repeat. Certainly no need to leave your seat.
