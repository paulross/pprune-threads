  Thanks for the summary tdracer, that really helps. Would posters please consider the technical information in tdracer's post as everyone formulates their thoughts? Let's work forward based on factual systems information please.

  </div>
  If I recall correctly, the Mayday call was wording to the effect "thrust not achieved". That sounds like a phrase which could be expected from a pilot who had just frantically tried to restart an engine, and realized that it was not a success, and there would not be an opportunity for another attempt. The pilot aviated, (forget navigation), then communicated - over a period of 13 seconds.

    What happened before this to cause the engines to run down, resulting in the crew trying the documented procedure of turning the switches off then on to restart ?
   </div>
  </div>
  Nothing in the report suggests that the engines began to run down before the fuel was selected to cutoff. The report states a sequence of events for power loss which
  <i>
   begins
  </i>
  with the switches being moved to cutoff. The maximum airspeed was immediately before the switches were moved, so there had not been a power rundown prior to that:

    The aircraft achieved the maximum recorded airspeed of 180 Knots IAS at about 08:08:42 UTC and immediately thereafter, the Engine 1 and Engine 2 fuel cutoff switches transitioned from RUN to CUTOFF position one after another with a time gap of 01 sec. The Engine N1 and N2 began to decrease from their take-off values as the fuel supply to the engines was cut off.

  From a PPRuNe perspective, good discussion here is desirable, as it is from a pilot perspective too. Nonsense or needlessly accusatory discussion, though it is discussion here, is not so good for pilots, and other well informed readers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some members want this thread locked, which is a choice we moderators can make, other members want discussion, which, if good, is desirable for everyone. We moderators prefer to not lock threads, we like to moderate, not terminate!
  <br/>
  <br/>
  So, could we all agree that knowing that both condition switches were selected  to cutoff by a pilot, we do not have information as to which pilot? What interest are we serving anyone by speculating which pilot here and now? Perhaps later, a full report adds to this knowledge, but possibly never.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I see four groups of readers here: Pilots of two crew airplanes, who are now instinctively more alert to what they are doing, and what their co crew is doing; Single crew pilots, who know that they are their own guardian against mistakes anyway; Designers, who are now thinking about improving designs to minimize the effects of pilot error; And, politely, everyone else.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pilots of two crew airplanes, you know what you have to do. Is slighting two members of our community helpful right now? In my opinion, I don't see how...
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Single pilots, you're on your own. Designers, yeah, we're thinking....
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Everyone else, the professional pilots forum is accepting your participation, please be respectful with what you post - you're posting it about pilots who recently passed away with high trauma. Is what you're about to post something helpful? Do you really want to say it? Will the pilot group be better because you did?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  We moderators don't want to lock the thread. And, we don't want to allow our core group of professional pilots to become profoundly aggravated by pages of low value posts. Please make our moderator jobs easier for us!
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thanks, Pilot DAR

  Yup Capn, that was posted while I wrote, I just removed it for exactly your observation.

  This thread may yet get locked if we keep seeing speculation like that!

  Okay, we're going to take a breath here for a little while, it's getting way too speculation laden, and fact barren. Think about what you might like to post for later, which will
  <i>
   contribute
  </i>
  - not just
  <i>
   speculate
  </i>
  . Is what you're going to post really, really new, and previously not thought of?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the mean time, take the time to read and search back, has your question/speculation already been asked an answered?
