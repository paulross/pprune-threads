     How does a 787 react to low speed? What are the protections on this type?
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Full suite of typical FBW flight envelope warnings and protections from initial "Airspeed Low" EICAS caution to inability to trim to autothrottle activation and pitch down, stick-shaker at onset of stall etc.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But nothing can protect against laws of physics that apply when there isn't just enough energy for a (possibly) shortened takeoff distance and misconfigured aircraft.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Very sad, and bewildering.

     Hmm.

  777 guy but you\x92re talking about two different things. Unless I\x92m mistaken. You\x92re talking about the Take Off Config EICAS warning. He\x92s talking about the Before Take Off checklist showing as complete, if the selected flaps aren\x92t in agreement with the entered CDU value.

  You're correct, but I'm not talking about the config warning, which will not sound for any takeoff flap (5, 10, 15, 17, 18, 20 for the -9) set. I'm talking about the BEFORE TAKEOFF checklist. The FLAP item on that checklist is closed-loop, meaning it looks for the CDU-entered value and compares it with the sensed flap position. If they differ, the FLAP item won't go green, therefore the checklist won't be completed. If not rectified, as the aircraft lines up (i.e., before thrust lever movement to set takeoff thrust and so nothing to do with the config warning), a MASTER CAUTION and the CHKLIST INCOMPLETE NORM EICAS is generated. Having said that, it's entirely possible that that function is operator-configurable. I'll check up on that.

     Default setup is left tank left engine, right tank right engine. Each engine also has two redundant pumps feeding it, meaning it can operate fully and normally on one operational engine fuel pump.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Furthermore, the engines cannot run from the center tank. There's no such thing. The center tank transfers to the outer tanks, when necessary or when running low or to resolve imbalances, either automatically or manually initated by the pilot for whatever reason. The engine fuel pumps only ever draw from their respective tank.
     <br/>
     It is as thus impossible for the center tank being empty to cause engine shutdown unless the main tanks were also empty, in which case we would: be in a lot of trouble, shouldn't be taking off, and wouldn't have a massive orange fireball.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Virtually everything in this post is wrong. The 787 fuel system is almost the same as the 767. The default setup is all fuel pumps on. Each wing tank sends fuel to the left or right respective manifold. The center (main) tank pumps send fuel to both manifolds and operate at a higher pressure than the wing tanks and will feed the manifolds for each side from its left or right pump before the wing tanks. If there is fuel in the center tank it is always burned first and directly supplies the manifolds to the engines. Once the center tank is empty the wing tanks then begin supplying fuel to their respective manifolds. If any pumps are inadvertently left off you will get a EICAS message and a light in the pump switch.

     Just a thought regarding the possibility of some kind of sensor failure: mud wasps.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Since this was a short stopover, perhaps pitot covers were not used. Mud wasps can build their nests in a very short timespan, and they have been known to block pitot tubes and static pitot ports in the past.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Just throwing this out there as one additional possible hole in one of the slices of cheese.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  787 doesn\x92t use an old fashioned system but an ADRS that displays a voted trusted speed (the same speed is displayed to both pilots). Block a pitot and it will vote that data out. Block all pitots and you\x92ll get a NAV AIRSPEED DATA EICAS and the AOA speed will be used as a valid source. You\x92ll only end up in an airspeed unreliable condition on one of three fault scenarios\x85simultaneous blockage of 2 of 3 pitot, complete blockage of 2 of 3 static ports or simultaneous seizure of both AoA vanes. Then the system gives you an EICAS with a memory action involved (disconnect AP, disarm AT, both FD off and set 10degrees up, 85% N1).

  Ahh, thanks! I agree 99%. But if what you say is correct, then isn't this a design flaw? I also don't understand why you'd do Gear Up and Flaps Down at the same time, if the flight was otherwise proceeding normally? But if you're being hypothetical, sure, the pilot might actually be able to induce an electrical failure. I can't comment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anyway, let's say we know what's supposed to happen when an engine-driven generator (or its GCS) quits. (Which incident do you refer to?) That's what all the redundancy is designed to address. And maybe that's exactly what did happen - a generator / GCS failed at high load in a high ambient temperature. But possibly the failure then highlighted a pre-existing but undetected fault in the switching system itself. With the generator working normally for (months?), everything seemed fine. Sadly, there are always possibilities that the designers don't consider, or are too hard (too expensive, etc) to address.

     Difficult!? Maybe not. If very late the flaps were tagged stowed, and there was a simultaneous gear up command, with FlapDown command, the overload could have failed a GCS. Then it becomes a switching exercise. (Automatics).

     Thanks for answering the question I hadn't yet asked but wanted to confirm!
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I'm still sticking with "Major Electrical Fault" as my most likely cause, and this adds to my suspicions.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     As I understand it, the landing gear is raised / retracted by electric motor-driven hydraulic pump (pumps?). This/these would create a significant electrical load.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     If the plane's multi-redundant electrical system has a fault which is intermittent (the worst kind of electrical issue to diagnose), and which causes the redundancy controls to go haywire (as there are, of course, electronic controls to detect failures and drive the switching over of primary and backup electrical supplies), then this fault could to triggered by a large load coming on-line. It could even be as simple as a high current cable lug not having been tightened when a part was being replaced at some stage. The relevant bolt might be only finger-tight. Enough to work 99.99% of the time between then and now... But a little bit more oxidation, and particularly, a bit more heat (it was a hot day), and suddenly, a fault.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Having worked in electronics for years, I know that semi-conductors (and lots of other components, especially capacitors [and batteries]) can also degrade instead of failing completely. Electro-static discharges are great for causing computer chips to die, or go meta-stable - meaning they can get all knotted up and cease working correctly - until they are powered off for a while. They can also degrade in a way that means they work normally a low temperatures, but don't above a certain temperature.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Anyway, there MUST be ways that the redundant power supplies can be brought down, simply because, to have a critical bus powered from a number of independent sources, there must be "controls" of some sort. I don't know how it's done in the 787, but that's where I'd be looking.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     As there is a lot of discussion already about how the bogies are hanging the wrong way suggesting a started but failed retraction operation, and it's now confirmed that the retraction would normally have taken place at about the point where the flight went "pear shaped", I'm going to suggest that the two things are connected. More than that: I'll suggest that the Gear Up command triggered the fault that caused both engines to shut down in very short succession. Nothing the pilots did wrong, and no way they could have known and prevented it.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     It's going to be difficult to prove though.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Gear and flaps are both hydraulic, and the hydraulic pumps typically act as effective fault-containment - a hydraulic failure or excess load doesn't result in excess demand on the electric side; the pump just starts to run out of output flow/pressure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In addition, the 787 has four main generators and I believe the switching is segregated into at least two controllers, on top of the four separate generator control units.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And again, electrical failure should not cause engine failure - consider QF32 where the wiring to the engine was mostly severed and they had to drown it with a fire truck.

     Best post until now in my view. We will find out very soon I think. Gear up command triggered the instant lack of fuel to both engines. I'm not sure on how the fuel flow is dependant on the power supplies on the 787 but I genuinely believe you are very very close to what might have happened here.

  It's not. Boost pumps should be more-or-less unnecessary at sea level.

     Yes, thanks, I've seen a few comments to this effect, and I have to accept most of what you say. I understand that they have their own dedicated generators and local independent FADECs (or EECs), but I'm trying to use what I do know to attempt to figure this out. I know that there are Fuel Cutoff switches in the cockpit. Somehow, if switched to Off, these will cut off the fuel to the engines, "no matter what". Of course, even that's not true, as the Qantas A380 engine burst apparently (comment in this thread) showed.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Anyway, the thing I'm looking at is how the fuel cutoff switch function could have been activated in some other way. To me, it seems obvious that there are wires that run between the engine fuel shutoff valves and the cockpit / flight control panel (no doubt with relays etc in between). I don't know where those shutoff valves are located, but logic says they should be located in the fuselage, not out at the engines. I also don't know how those valves operate - are they solenoid valves or electro-mechanically driven? Nor do I know where the power to activate those valves comes from, but using my logic, if those valves close when powered off, such as solenoid valves typically do, then the power cannot exclusively come from the engine-dedicated generators. If it did, you'd never be able to start the engines so they could supply their own power to hold those valves open. So, there must be some power (appropriately) fed from the main aircraft control bus to activate those valves - if the rest of what I'm assuming is correct. Anyway, like I say, I don't know enough about the details at this point, but there are many more ways to activate or deactivate a circuit than by flicking a switch. Killing the relevant power supply, for example. A screwdriver across some contacts (for example), another. Shorting a wire to Chassis, maybe. Just trying to contribute what I can.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     You raise another interesting point: "TCMA notwithstanding". Could you elaborate, please? What will happen if the TCMA system, which apparently also has some degree of engine control, loses power? The problem with interlinked circuits and systems is that sometimes, unexpected things can happen when events that were not considered actually happen. If one module, reporting to another, loses power or fails, sometimes it can "tell" the surviving module something that isn't true... My concern is where does the power to the Fuel Cutoff switches come from? Are there relays or solid-state switches (or what?) between the Panel Switches and the valves? If so, is the valve power derived from a different source, and if so, where? Are the valves solenoids, open when power applied, or something else? What is the logic involved, between switch and valve?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Would you mind answering these questions so I can ponder it all further, please? If I'm wrong, I'll happily say so.

    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I believe the valves are almost all bi-stable power-open power-close. When not powered, they remain in the last commanded position.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The valves are located in the spar (hence being called 'spar valves'. The fuel tank is immediately above the engine so it is a very short pipe for suction feeding. Tail mount engines are potentially a different story...

     Retired engineer here. Following my post a while ago on the avionics electrical system I have read all the posts and also noticed mention of the hydraulics system.
     <br/>
     Returning to my original source, which is
     <span style="color:#000000">
      Book 1 Introduction to B787 Avionic/Electrical, I read on p. 96 that the RAT will deploy if any of three condions are met.
      <br/>
      Maybe the URL will work this time
     </span>
     <br/>
     <a href="https://fliphtml5.com/quwam/qhdw/Book_1_-_Introduction_to_B787_Avionics_Electrical" target="_blank">
      https://fliphtml5.com/quwam/qhdw/Boo...ics_Electrical
     </a>
     <br/>
     <span style="color:#000000">
      These conditions for deployment of the RAT specifically are:
      <br/>
      Loss of both engines
      <br/>
      Loss of power to the instrument buses
      <br/>
      Loss of all three hydraulic systems
      <br/>
      <br/>
      The latter one may be worth a close look because it would appear that problems took place when the wheels left the runway and I assume there was a change of states in various sensors. I surmise these sensors are different from the engine systems where both commands and power are needed to force a change of state in, say, fuel pumps. Is it the same for thrust control?
      <br/>
      It says there are three hydraulic systems but is there a common reservoir? I'm not an expert in that field but google tells me that B787 has a bootstrap reservoir system which I understand to mean that a pressure of 5000 psi is maintained using a piston arrangement.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      At this point think timeline, and changes of states.
      <br/>
      There is an operational change when the wheels leave the ground. The associated sensors would send that data to the CCS. What was sent? Maybe the CCS read Hydraulic L + Hydraulic R + Hydraulic C = incorrect or fail, which would trigger deployment of the RAT. What would the electrical and control system do then? More importantly what exactly did all the systems do on this aircraft following such an event.
      <br/>
      Was there a problem with the fluid in the hydraulics? Does hydraulic fluid ever 'go off' in very hot conditions. Or maybe there wasn't as much fluid in there than there should have been? How would hydraulics systems be compromised if indeed that was the case.
      <br/>
      All speculation - but forensic system analysis is a bit like that
     </span>
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Three hydraulic systems, each with their own reservoir, pumps, and accumulators. Engine bleed air (I think; some newer aircraft have a semi-permanent nitrogen charge) keeps a few tens of PSI of positive pressure in the reservoir to prevent pump cavitation; loss of this is not an emergency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Left and right hydraulics have an engine driven pump that will keep turning as long as the engine is turning unless explicitly disabled.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Low reservoir levels are both a maintenance check and something that will raise an EICAS warning.

     The biggest news site in Greece claims to have the results of a kind of preliminary report from India AAIB which say that as the plane rotated, the pilot's seat malfunctioned (broken pin) and went suddenly far back forcing the captain to accidentally lower the thrust lever as he already had his hand on it and despite the co-pilots effort to help increase the thrust it was already to late to avoid the stall. I dont believe they would have posted something as serious as this without any credible source cause they are supposed to be a serious news outlet but you never know when stupidity takes over validity. Source is the protothema dot gr site

  There are at least two whatsapp chain messages doing the rounds (one about the seat theory and one about water on electrics causing FADEC failure). Both are very detailed but clearly fake news with incorrect dates, ECAM instead of EICAS and lots of other things which are clearly inaccurate. They\x92ve probably seen this and reporting it as news

     Water ingress into the E/E bay is a serious issue. The B744 had this issue in the past causing serious problems, one of which was fortunate to not lead to a loss of the aircraft, on a B744F. The B744 pax aircraft had a number of water problems related to the toilets and the galley. The forward galley on the B742/3s had many issues.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Any large aircraft going through maintenance is interesting to observe the extent of corrosion that occurs near toilets and galleys, and from water lines.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Water accumulations on the B744 came to light at rotate, and took out a lot of electrical services.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     My suspicion is some cause such as this will come to light shortly.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Both of the E/E bays contain stuff that is nice to keep dry and operating, and prior events have shown that multiple system failures can and have occurred when a flood is added to all the black boxes sitting innocently on their racks.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The ADs are not necessarily directly related to the specific cause, they highlight the potential for water damage and that bad stuff happens. In two cases I investigated, the event occurred at rotate. Both were B744's one pax, one F.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Compound, unrelated system failures at rotate? Single cause? Water in the E/E bay.

  A Qantas 747-438 suffered an 'Electrical System Event' when on approach to Bangkok airport on 7 January 2008. The following extracts are taken from the report:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "System malfunctions
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Between 0846 and 0852, 4 after passing FL 100 and when the aircraft was turning
  <br/>
  onto an extended left downwind leg for runway 01 Right (01R), the EICAS, flight
  <br/>
  displays and automated systems showed faults of numerous electrical and other
  <br/>
  aircraft systems, including:
  <br/>
  \x95 AC buses 1, 2 and 3 not powered
  <br/>
  \x95 autothrottle disconnected
  <br/>
  \x95 autopilot disengaged
  <br/>
  \x95 some fuel pumps not operating
  <br/>
  \x95 weather radar not operating
  <br/>
  \x95 automatic cabin air conditioning and pressurisation system not operating
  <br/>
  \x95 right (FO\x92s) displays blanked
  <br/>
  \x95 between three and five pages of messages on the EICAS display
  <br/>
  \x95 lower EICAS display blanked.
  <br/>
  The CSM contacted the flight crew and advised that the cabin lighting had failed."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Origin of Generator Control Unit (GCU) faults
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Post-incident examination of the GCUs revealed corrosion of the internal circuit
  <br/>
  boards in all three of the GCUs that shut down. Analysis of the corrosion materials
  <br/>
  observed in GCU 3 showed evidence of long-term exposure to water, including
  <br/>
  evidence of acids and carbohydrates that are present in beverages such as coffee,
  <br/>
  fruit juice and soft drinks. Those findings indicated a fluid source originating from
  <br/>
  the aircraft\x92s galley drains or from spilt liquids in the cabin, and also suggested that
  <br/>
  liquid ingress had been occurring over an unknown, but extended period of time."

  </a>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This link to the report includes diagrams of where the 747 forward galley was located, directly above the Main Equipment Centre and the E1/E2 racks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The phtographs show how ineffective the dripshield was in protecting the electrical equipment and the extent of corrosion and damage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The aircraft was 17 years old at the time of the incident and had completed a C-check approximately three months before the incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As FDR notes, this issue seems to have carried over to the 787-8 with Airworthiness Directive AD 2016-14-04 (
  <a href="https://drs.faa.gov/browse/excelExternalWindow/A5DEFBD6365368B486257FEA0058AF6B.0001" target="_blank">
   https://drs.faa.gov/browse/excelExte...A0058AF6B.0001
  </a>
  )
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are issuing this AD 2016-14-04 to prevent a water leak
  <br/>
  from an improperly installed potable water system coupling, or main cabin water source, which could
  <br/>
  cause the equipment in the EE bays to become wet, resulting in an electrical short and potential loss
  <br/>
  of system functions essential for safe flight"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  AD 2016-14-04 mirrors precisely what occurred to the Qantas 747 on 7 January 2008. It is possible something similar may have occurred on take-off of AI171, with water causing the equipment in the EE bays to become wet resulting in electrical short and potential loss of system functions

  There have been a few accidents where the thrust levers were at idle right up to the point of impact. Turkish airlines in Amsterdam and Asiana in SFO. I think a lot of pilots are of the view that the thrust levers are set and forget. Whether the fuel stopped through a shut-off by equipment failure or a mismanaged event by the crew I think pilots should regain the practice of keeping a hand on the T/L whenever they are airborne and in the take-off or landing phase. I'm not blaming the crew in this accident but I can well imagine the confusion in processing a series of indications from EICAS that the aircraft was no longer capable of climbing. They simply would not have had the time to do even the most rudimentary G.R.A.D.E. or whatever acronym for decision making AI use to have recovered the situation. Airline pilots are not test pilots and are taught to be methodical in dealing with an emergency. If it transpires that it was a fault with the engines, either software or hardware, then the regulatory authorities need to consider the validity of 370 minutes ETOPS.

  Can any 78 driver think of a scenario where an abnormal switch position (I'm thinking far up on the overhead panel like one of those Engineer test switches) or a pulled CB may have allowed the flight to continue the takeoff roll with perhaps one (or two) simple EICAS messages (which the crew might have ignored), to then later on result in something catastrophic?

     I recommend that everyone look at the video posted by Sawbones62 in

     . The video (Stig Shift #76) is by a qualified B787 engineer and he looks at the various aircraft systems that are being discussed in the Air India accident. With respect to the landing gear, he concludes that the landing gear handle must have been selected up for the bogies to have been tilted front down.

  I too watched his explanation with interest. However I believe he is not considering the possibility of C hydraulics failure prior to wheels lift-off, because I speculated this is the more likely reason the gear trucks remained in a forward tilt position,

  . I believe the crew never got as far as calling for the Gear Up... many possible reasons for this, flickering instrument screens during the electrical switchover to battery power, flurry of EICAS messages. For any of those things happening around time of rotation, I would be advocating delaying gear up decision until safely climbing away above AA and as a crew you have chance to discuss safest course of action. Not putting the gear up shouldn't kill you.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Point is the gear truck tilt is a clue of a C hydraulics failure, but we cant determine if hydraulics failed prior to wheels off runway or prior to gear doors opening in retraction sequence.

  Presumably the RAT was deployed (with an "humungous" bang) when the residual pressure in the "C" hydraulic system decayed to zero: there was initially enough to tilt the trucks but thats it.

     In terms of power, each FADEC has its own alternator driven by the engine. But there\x92s a failover connection to the AC bus of the plane. Not sure if there\x92s a physical relay keeping it disconnected in normal operations.
    </div>
   </div>

  There is. And the disconnection is tested after engine start up. A failed disconnection will give an EICAS "No dispatch" message.
