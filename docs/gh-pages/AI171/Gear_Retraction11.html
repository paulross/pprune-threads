     The issues with the "they shut down the wrong engine" theory:
     <br/>
     1. No asymmetry evidence with flight path deviation. No roll, no yaw effects
     <br/>
     2. No rudder inputs visible.
     <br/>
     3. No crew should be doing memory items below 400ft. Boeing requires each crew member confirm together memory item switch/control selections.
     <br/>
     4. Non-normal gear truck tilt position, a one engine failure should not affect the C hydraulics. As per (3) gear would be selected Up before any memory actions.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The evidence so far is an almost simultaneous dual engine failure, which rules out alot of other theories.

  This was already addressed in one of tdracer's posts about the TCMA system: the air/ground decision is made by the aircraft itself (using multiple redundant inputs and voting logic), and only a single air/ground binary state is provided to the EEC(FADEC). Further, he also stated that the EEC assumes "air", as that is the safer state given the nature of its operations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Based on this, both engines will get the same air/ground indication from the aircraft and hence will always make the same TCMA decisions (subject to their individual throttle positions and thrust outputs).

     . What is apparent is a (substantial) loss of thrust. That's what one can say with some certainty.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  The available video and trajectory information are quite conclusive that both engines stopped producing thrust within 12 seconds of the main wheels leaving the ground. Had partial power of any level remained, the aircraft impact would have been further away from the departure end of the runway. The NE end camera shows by using transit sightings against identifiable structures, that the failure occurred while the aircraft was still within the airport boundary area. The energy state of the aircraft at that time trades off to impact at the correct time and place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On departure at these weights the aircraft would have some assumed temperature thrust reduction from max available on the GEnx -1B70, Unless they were carrying lead, they were around 30,000 or more below the limit weight for a flaps 5 TO. At that weight, around 440k lbs, they would have had a fair OEI climb gradient on one engine, certainly a positive gradient with the gear down, so they lost more than 50% of total thrust. There is no yaw or roll, or inputs to counter a yaw or roll moment so the aircraft was symmetrical at all times, that means losing absolutely no less than 50% of total available thrust at that point on each engine. At 50% reduction. the aircraft would have continued a positive gradient with the gear down and the flaps at the TO setting. It did not, it decelerated at around 1meter sec, or 0.1g deceleration for just maintaining level flight, but it also had to descend and that was worth around 0.05g as well. Instead of having any positive thrust margin, the guys were needing to descend to balance the decrement in thrust of around 0.15g, and that means it has negligible to no thrust from the engines. The full analysis takes more effort as the AOA has increased over the 15-20 seconds to impact, which is increasing the drag of the aircraft rapidly towards the end. For the first 5-10 seconds however, it is not such a great change, but it is still increasing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In level flight, the aircraft would accelerate level at around 0.3-0.4g gear down with both engines running at max chuff. Lose one, and you are back to 0.05-0.1g or so. These guys had far less than one engine remaining, gravity was all that they had going for them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To that end, there is no requirement to have the EAFR readout of the N1, N2, FF, or EGT, the video shows they had no puff going worth a darn. That is basic back of the envelope physics and anyone who does aircraft performance testing would be able to get that answer straight from the video without using a calculator, by the time they had watched the video a couple of times in replay.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I have no qualms on stating that the engines are not operating, the RAT, gear tilt are consistent with the dynamics of the aircraft. This is far simpler to determine the energy state than that of the B738W at Muan, the lack of early video required a couple of iterations of the kinetic energy of the aircraft at Muan to end up with a probable flight path, and most likely estimate of the thrust remaining for those most unfortunate souls.

  Yes, all true. And I didn't think your earlier post was incredible, just that it was an exercise not intended to explain
  <i>
   everything
  </i>
  about air/ground logic.  I think that, in the real world, it's most likely that the air/ground decision will take inputs from other sensors, not just WoW.  Radio altimeters seem the most likely choice and we've been told they've been used on earlier Boeings (which I think I already knew or assumed).  I'd certainly feel safer with that arrangement.

     The gear tilt position is not definitive evidence crew had selected gear up. I've speculated another cause for this non-normal gear tilt is that C hydraulics failed around time of rotation. This would explain the gear remaining in the forward tilt position. There are reasons why the crew may have not selected gear up,

     Therefore we cannot determine wow or air/ground logic from an assumed gear retraction.

  Without knowing the 787-8 gear system, we know that is is supposed to be hydraulically moved from \x94nose up\x94 to nose down as the first step in the gear up sequence. But do we know that it would end up \x94nose down\x94 without hyd pressure?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another point pointing to that the aircraft did consider itself being \x94In Air\x94 is the ADS-B data sending Altitude from the first 575 feet at

   08:08:46.55 until at least 08:50.87\x85?

   I would think the sub systems like TCMA would use the same In Air / On Ground logic as the aircraft normally use?
   <br/>
   I come from an FBW aircraft with a Air/Ground logic that seems rather bullet proof and would
   <b>
    guess
   </b>
   the 787 wouldn\x92t use a less solid logic which probably, in doubt would consider it being \x94In Air\x94?

   It would be \x94logic\x94 for the TCMA to use this logic?

     But at this point it&rsquo;s wayyyyyyy too early to do any Boeing Bashing based on an accident none of us have any clue as to the cause.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Indian media has been reporting all week that the DGCA said only 24 of Air India's 33 Boeing 787 aircraft had passed an "enhanced safety inspection" it had ordered the airline to carry out. What this actually means is one third of the 787 fleet didn't pass safety inspections. 7 were in fact grounded. Possible incompetency in maintenance, or/and maintenance that is increasingly required due to incompetency in design, manufacturing and inferior components, for reasons I&rsquo;ll explain further down.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Even before the crash, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) had warned Air India of multiple safety protocol violations after three of its planes continued operations despite pending security checks of emergency systems. This warning was issued days before the Ahmedabad Air India Plane crash. In one case an AI plane flew to destinations such as Dubai, Riyhad and Qatar despite a 1 month delay in carrying out mandatory inspections. Indian Media has reported numerous instances of AI planes failing Pre-flight inspections and Daily/Turnaround inspections that are crucial before every flight, and still flying.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In fact, Air India has long suffered from numerous technical failures, creaky aircraft and demoralised staff, even before the disastrous crash, and certainly since.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On 10th March:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - AI125 (Chicago to Dehli) was forced to turn around after 5 hours
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On 16th June:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - Al315 (Hong Kong to Delhi) returned to base due to technical snags that the pilots decided weren&rsquo;t safe to fly with
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - Al9695 (Delhi to Ranchi) returned to base due to technical snags that the pilots decided weren&rsquo;t safe to fly with
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - A BA Boeing 787 was forced to turn back to London

  Problems are reported in Indian media to be deep and structural. From Indian bureaucracy (Babudom), prevalent in both public, ex public and recently privatised sectors, poor work ethics, an &ldquo;it will do&rdquo; (chalta hai) culture, bullying and hierarchical workplace, to paying lip service to maintenance and health and safety. Indian media has reported grave safety concerns surfacing within Air India, with whistleblowers accusing the airline of negligence and misconduct. Captain Sivaran was sacked for raising safety issues, after refusing to fly illegally with issues that compromised passenger safety, including emergency oxygen deployment not passing safety tests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Previously Government owned, Air India was privatised and taken over by Tata, who are notorious for cost cutting and infamous for poor health and safety records. Indian media have reported that the Engineering department responsible for maintenance and passing technical inspections had their salary frozen despite rampant inflation, had staff cut, and had all their benefits removed. Many workers have apparently (according to my Indian friends) more or less given up on their work, and were just passing the documents because they had neither the manpower nor the time to do them, and were under intense pressure by management to pass them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Air India had a Turkish contractor at Ahmedabad to maintain their widebodies, which they abruptly dropped around 2 weeks ago, apparently because Turkey refused to ditch its cordial relations with Pakistan. Who took this contract over and what capacity they had to do so is unclear because AI have so far refused to comment or answer questions specifically on this.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the meantime, Tata have been serving defamation lawsuits in India on any news organisation that dares to criticise them for anything. They have a long history of doing this.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It&rsquo;s important to note that all this is happening while 53% of posts at the DGCA remain vacant, along with 35% of posts at the bureau of civil aviation security and 17% of posts at the airports authority of India.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite all this, the Indian PM Modi has a very aggressive target of reaching 240mn air passengers annually by the end of this year, rising to 500mn by 2030, and a tripling of cargo capacity from 3.5 million metric tonnes by the end of this year to 10 million metric tonnes. This is merely exacerbating the problems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And then there&rsquo;s the plane type itself. The 787-8 has 9 Technical safety issues per million Flight hours. Technical safety issues are faults that comprise the safe operation of the flight. The A350, by contrast, has 0.3 Technical safety issues per million Flight hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the 787, this equates to 3.8 technical diversions per 100 aircraft annually. For the A350, it equates to 0.13 technical diversions per 100 aircraft annually, or 1 technical diversion every 8 years across 100 aircraft. Examining publicly available Airline Performance Reliability Metrics, we can see much less of a variance with the A350 across airlines when compared to 787-8 across airlines and tiers, and a much lower rate of faults by factors of 50-100.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The A350 design is maintenance friendly, meaning the plane is reliable independent of operator tier. The 787-8 design is exposed to quality of maintenance. Boeing planes have an uncomfortably high rate of background faults meaning they need to rely on the redundant systems far more often than their competitors such as Airbus. Despite the 737 Max crashes we continue to see Boeing planes experience much higher levels of system faults and failures in its flagship products. This level of acceptance of systemic failures leaning on the redundant systems for normal operation creates situations where multiple catastrophic failures are increasingly possible.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  You might think the above data could be biased by the battery issues that plagued Dreamliners early on, and led to them being grounded for a short period. However, if you examine the data, rather than seeing lower issues we see continual concerning noise of similar peaks, with higher rates in recent years, even after the battery issues were apparently addressed in 2013. So the 787-8 has a noisy gremlin baseline of issues - something we don't see in the Airbus products. If we dig into the public data, we can see that the vast majority of these issues are engine and electrical related. Not a shock in itself, given the heavy electrical design of the plane. Thanks to the testimony of Boeing whistleblower Sam Salehpour, we know that Boeing used improper techniques to ground electrical systems on the 787. This can lead to arcing, overheating, and potential fire hazards&mdash;all of which we&rsquo;ve seen cause problems on multiple occasions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It doesn't seem to matter which engine type is installed, the Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 or GE GenX1B, by the way. When normalised for fleet distribution, both variants show around 2.5 events per million flight hours. That strongly suggests the problem isn't engine related. It's the integration between the engines and the 787s electrical architecture.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  We know that various electrical systems on this particular plane were non operational, and that an ex crew member has said that this plane had long been plagued with electrical issues. I&rsquo;ve heard lots of people say that this doesn&rsquo;t matter, because they&rsquo;re on separate systems to the engines due to redundancy, so it&rsquo;s ok. But that&rsquo;s not strictly true, once you understand how the redundancy works. What it effectively means you&rsquo;ve removed a layer of redundancy, and you are relying on that redundancy just to be able to fly normally. This means that the Swiss cheese already has two or more holes lined up, and your redundancy is no longer as deep.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Redundant systems exist to catch rare failures. 1 in a million anomalies that slip through every other safeguard. They are meant to back up a reliable system, not compensate for frequent faults. Planes should not be designed to run frequently on redundancy. In aviation you evaluate a highly redundant yet failure-prone aircraft not just on whether it stays aloft, but on reliability and maintainability metrics, such as meantime between failures, Technical safety issues per million Flight hours, and other airline performance metrics, almost all of which the 787, and other Boeing planes, have a far higher rate of than their Airbus competitors. No one should be accepting multiple faults as okay simply because redundancies are there to protect the passengers. And yet that appears to be the case in the 787-8.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Compact Air Compressors (CAC) are 4 individual units. Their role isn't just passenger comfort. They regulate cabin pressure, temperature and cool down key electrical systems, which is critical. With nearly a megawatt of electricity flowing through the aircraft, heat becomes a serious issue. If it isn't dissipated properly, it can cause component degradation, arcing or even shutdowns&mdash;sound familiar?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  DC behaviour can be unstable. Arcing that doesn't want to stop. Arcing and insulation isn&rsquo;t always a good combination. Insulation materials do not like heat, and arcs produce a lot of it in very short time frames. If you are short-circuiting a fine signal wire with a thick power transmission cable (like the supply for entertainment system), there's no fuse or circuit breaker designed to protect this fine wire. The fine wire may become a fuse. This means the wire, for its full length, may change its state from solid to plasma. As this wire is not protected inside a low pressure glas cylinder like a real fuse, the insulation will become a mix of solid, liquid, gas and plasma. Neighbouring insulation probably too. We know a cable can overheat and melt the insulation of two redundant sensors at the same time. The SA 111 fire was due to arcing in a faulty entertainment system (sound familiar?). All this wiring from all these redundant systems comes together in some places to the same devices, such as the display showing the pilots the engine parameters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Let&rsquo;s say a single Variable Speed Frequency Generator (VSFGs) fails and the system isolates it. The Generator Control Breaker (GCB) opens, cutting the failure fail generator off from the 235 volt BUS. The BUS Power Control Units (BPCU) are in charge of parcelling DC distribution, which enable BUS isolation and linking BUSes together. Power is automatically rerouted via BUS Tie Breakers (BTBs) and the remaining three generators, or the Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) if needed, to pick up the load. The Electrical Load Management System (ELMS) may shed non-essential loads like galley ovens, inflight entertainment and passenger AC, but primary flight systems stay online. Sound familiar?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The crew sees an alert but there's no loss of function. Pressurisation, flight controls, anti-ice etc. all continue uninterrupted. If both generators on one side go down, it&rsquo;s serious. The entire sides 235VT AC BUS drops. In response the right side generators and/or reroute power across the backup BUS path via isolation relays. If the APU isn't available, the Ram Air Turbine (RAT) deploys, automatically feeding emergency power into the system. The switch happens in under a second, quick enough to avoid flight critical interruptions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If a CAC overheats, over speeds, or loses turbo pressure, the system shuts it down. The opposite side CAC kicks in automatically to handle cabin pressurisation and thermal loads, and the ELMS adjusts the outflow valves or reduces pack flow as needed. Passengers may notice a shift in cabin temperature or pressure but no immediate safety is compromised.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In rarer cases, where both CACs on one side fail, that side's Environmental Control System (ECS) goes offline. ELMS quickly boosts output from the remaining side to stabilise conditions. Anti-ice and other systems may be throttled back to preserve cabin integrity. Climb or descent rates might slow but again the plane keeps flying. If both engine generators fail mid-flight the RAT deploys within seconds. It starts delivering around 30 kilovolt amps, just enough to keep the backup BUS, CACs and Transformer Rectifier Units (TCU)s alive. Once the Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) spins up and takes over, the RAT retracts automatically. That transition typically takes about 1 to 2 minutes&mdash; not ideal but survivable, given enough altitude. But more flight critical electrical systems potentially aren&rsquo;t being cooled enough. The holes in the Swiss cheese are being aligned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On paper Boeing's electrical power architecture should never cascade into a total failure. Cross ties, smart load shedding, redundant processes and trip curves all exist to stop one fault from spiralling into another. Yet there is at least 1 constant risk: Simultaneous Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC) Protect Idle. Basically it&rsquo;s the equipment of &ldquo;limp home" mode in a car ECU.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  FADEC is the electronic engine control computer. In certain DC side faults both FADECs, one to each engine, can perceive a loss of power, and command engines into protect idle. This flight idle schedule is 25 to 30% of N1, which I believe is about 8% of max thrust, designed to protect against over speed or surge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Taken together the apparently most probable sequence - the RAT deploying, the engines spooling to idle, an inability to retract the gear - could be explained by an edge case - a full AC generation failure followed by a brief 28 volt DC sag tripping both Direct Memory Access (DMA) and DC channels on each FADEC, and forcing protect idle fuel schedules mid-takeoff.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This could be from any number of electrical issues, such a transient high load sag - during a hot day, a high power event, gear retraction, avionics peak loads etc. The chances of this are of course exacerbated if one or more VSFG LS or CACS are already out, as seems plausible in this case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Perhaps someone can help me here please? I believe the monitoring systems on a Boeing 787 sample the electrical system voltages and currents at a relatively high frequency. This gives the potential to over-react to a transient event by taking immediate action instead of waiting a short time before re-sampling again. There is the possibility of the Bus Tie Contactor (BTC) closing, something fairly fundamental to the electrical system. The 787 uses variable frequency AC generators whose outputs are rectified and then inverted to other AC voltages and high DC voltages, some in the 250-300V region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The DC BUS voltage could drop below the under voltage threshold. At same time the engine's DMA's output can sag; it&rsquo;s rectifier sees too low an AC input, so both channel A and channel B sense a low voltage. Alternatively, a shared harness or ground fault, to two sensing circuits that share a common power quality filter and grounding path in the Forward equipment bay. In this case, a single heavy chafe, splice failure, or melted connector, upstream of both sense lines, can remove the sense reference for both channels, making them think the voltage dropped out. Another possibility is a solid state controller reset; a VSFG contactor arc, or a Transient Rectifier Unit (TRU) can momentarily reset the upstream power converters. If both the DMAs built-in rectifier and TRU's electronics are held in reset by the same transient, for example by a very big VSFG arc, both channels will indicate loss until the converters restart. Yet another possibility is water damage, or a lithium battery fire damage (sound familiar?) in an electrical connector, for example shorting the 28V DC BUS for the Electronic Throttle System (ETS) which controls thrust, which means it can&rsquo;t talk to the FADEC, prompting Protect Idle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Does anyone know how Boeing, Regulators and/or Airline test electrical/computer interactions in the 787 involving arcing/shorting voltage/current transient testing across and upstream from FADEC? The Electronic Engine Controls (EECs) and FADECs in the engines are self-powered via magnetos and self-controlling in many circumstances, but perhaps something like the above occurred, due to the effect of electrical transients on the various signals received by the EECs. The code in FDACs is only made to cover problems the programmers have thought of and are testable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  You can detect a non-fictional sensor (such as a broken wire) or one where there are the two signal wires short circuiting each other, because both scenarios deliver known values. But if, for example, an analogue sensor outputting a specific voltage on a specific value like engine core temperature (say 1V on 50 degrees, 8V on 500 degrees, 12V on 1000 degrees) and you shortcut two sensors at the same time with a power supply wire, that delivers stable 12V, the input will read for both computers a plausible vale of 1000 degrees, a overheating engine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Of all these, the most likely scenario is still a real dual sag: a momentary high demand spike that drags both the DMA AC output and the 28vt DC BUS below their thresholds for long enough&mdash;approximately 200 to 300 milliseconds&mdash;that the BPCUs see it as a true loss of both channels. The RAT automatically deploys in under two seconds when both main AC buses drop. I believe someone here has already asked the question of how aircraft engines might react to a transient power fault. With engines idle, I believe hydraulic electric pumps lose their power so the crew couldn't retract the gear.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  IMO, the available information about the aircraft type and it&rsquo;s past and current issues, the individual aircraft itself and it&rsquo;s past issues, and the airline and airport and their issues, point towards an extreme Swiss cheese alignment of electrical faults in hot and humid high power conditions, possibly causing a software glitch, potentially exacerbated by poor maintenance and design/manufacturing. This catastrophic electrical anomaly may have forced both FADECS into protect idle producing the observed flight profile.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The background noise of gremlins in a 787's electrical and engine systems is concerning. When your platform accumulates sporadic faults the probability, however minor, of a full electrical collapse is no longer zero. Continually relying on redundancy systems for operational flight massively increases the risk.

     That\x92s the nature of a common mode bug. If the software was vulnerable to Mars being in the house of Uranus, the scent of lilacs and the DOW being less than 42,000 then you\x92d expect the failure to occur everywhere when these conjoined. Same when an aeroplane\x92s systems and/or the environment present data that triggers an unplanned/unforeseen response in something like an EEC/FADEC. The experts still appear to think that this is unlikely but we have been presented with an unlikely occurrence...
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I have to both agree and disagree with both this and the next post by TryingToLearn.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yes, there may be (let's assume is) "identical" FADEC/TCMA hardware and firmware on both engines, but if the Left Engine is subject to Mars in the house of Uranus (wink wink), then the Right Engine cannot be, maybe it's Venus in the same House. This is simply because the Left engine TCMA 'contraption', I'm going to call it, is monitoring Left Engine Conditions (Shaft Speed, T/L setting / position data - Right or Wrong, and calculating and comparing accordingly against its internal map) while the opposite TCMA "device" is monitoring and calculating etc, Right Engine Conditions. There are some things in common, but (I say) it's virtually impossible for the Engine Conditions being individually monitored to be identical in both engines.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Thrust Levers are electro-mechanical devices, almost certainly at this stage pushed by a somewhat squishy human hand, likely with a slight offset. What is the probability that those two levers are in identical positions, and even if they are, that the calibration (e.g. "zero points") of both levers are identical, and that the values they output (response slopes/curves) are exactly matching in every matching point in their individual travels? That's just one aspect, but consider the engines. They are different ages. Have different amounts of wear. They have separate fuel metering valves (or other names), separate HP Fuel pumps (and, I guess relief valves?), all also subject to wear), and each has a host of other, correspondingly paired, sensors, (maybe of different makes and certainly of different ages and different calibrations and response curves) from which each FADEC, supposedly independently of the TCMA, adjusts the fuel metering device settings and resulting engine power, and shaft RPMs follow in some other slightly non-matching way.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sure, I would completely agree that the two engines and their calculated Throttle Lever positions to Shaft RPMs are always going to be similar during normal, matched operation, and they will very likely dance with each other, maybe one 'always' (75% of the time, say) leading during one dance (TO, say) with the other leading in dancing to a different tune (descent, say).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To me, the fact that this appears to have been an almost simultaneous dual engine failure, pretty much, for me, rules out a FADEC/TCMA firmware bug, especially as there don't seem to be any reports of even a single engine mid-air TCMA shutdown.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  HOWEVER, and I want to stress this, that doesn't rule out the possibility that both TCMAs shutdown their respective engines simultaneously. Any lack of simultaneity observed would be due to those slight differences in other pieces of hardware, such as the time for one Shutoff valve to close versus the other.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As far as I know, there isn't enough information on what's actually inside those TCMA Black Boxes to say anything for sure, but here's a thought, which I think has been alluded to, or the question asked, here in one or other thread, earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  What does the TCMA firmware do when an engine is already running at a high power setting and TWO things occur in quick succession?  I suspect this kind of event is a highly probable cause, but these two events have not occurred close enough together, or ever, before.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Imagine this: Plane taking off, Throttle Levers near Full Power, Engines performing correctly, also near Full Power, Rotation etc all normal, plane beginning to climb, positive rate achieved.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pilot calls GEARUP. GearUp, activated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Gear Retract sequence begins. Due to some unforeseen or freshly occurring (maybe intermittent short or open circuit) linkage between the gear Up sequence and the WOW or Air/Ground System, the signal to both TCMAs suddenly switches to GROUND. All "good", so far, as the engine RPMs match the Throttle Lever settings and TCMA doesn't flinch. The plane could be in a Valid Takeoff sequence, so it had better not!  But it does make a bit of sense. How is WOW / Air/Ground detected? Somewhere near the Landing Gear, I assume.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  HOWEVER, now, a moment later, and perhaps due to a related system response, the Thrust Levers suddenly get pulled back to Idle, whether by man or Machine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  What would you expect the TCMA system to do? I would guess, fairly soon thereafter, two, independent, Fuel Cutoffs... Though I fully admit, I'm guessing based on a severe lack of knowledge of that Firmware.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ok, no need for further explanation on that point, but I did refer to TCMA unflatteringly as a contraption, earlier. Last night (regrettably, before bed) I started looking at the TCMA Google Patent. Let's just say, so far, I'm aghast! My first impressions are bad ones. How did this patent even get approved?  What I suspect here, now, is not a Firmware bug, but a serious Logic and Program Defect. But we'd have to see what's inside the firmware.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When I get more time, I'll dig deeper.
