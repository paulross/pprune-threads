      I found descriptions on the systems of the 787 were easily discovered online, and while I have no hands-on experience of aircraft related matters, I do have experience in wider electrical theory and maintenance.

      <br>
       THRUST Asymmetry PROTECTION.
       <br>
        <span style="color:#666666">
         "For an engine-out condition, Thrust Asymmetry Protection (TAP) reduces thrust on the operating engine to ensure there is sufficient rudder for directional control. TAP reduces thrust when the airspeed decreases below approximately V2 on a takeoff or below approximately VREF on a go-around. Once speed is increased above V2/VREF, TAP increases thrust."
        </span>
        <br>
         <br>
          <span style="color:#666666">
           From what we know so far, it does seem the engines were not producing sufficient thrust, during a period when it would also be crucial to maintain electrical output for the electro-hydraulic systems and critical electrical loads.
          </span>
          <br>
           <br>
            Reduced electrical output could explain the failure of the gear to complete retraction, maybe caused by a generator failing at the worst possible moment.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            If there was an EFATO, the ability of the remaining generators to provide sufficient power might become questionable, as is highlighted with the load shedding system.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Other features which are unique to the 787 could be contributing factors in explaining the accident.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            It is known the 787 will generally employ an extended take-off roll,
            <span style="color:#666666">
             and a relatively higher V1 and Vr,
            </span>
            <span style="color:#666666">
             and also climb out less steeply than other aircraft.
            </span>
            <span style="color:#666666">
             Using more of the runway would reduce the margin for aborted take offs.
            </span>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <span style="color:#666666">
             With the evident lack of thrust early in the climb out, and failure to retract the gear, if V2 had not been maintained, the TAP system would have reduced thrust even further. Manually increasing thrust will be inhibited.
            </span>
           </br>
          </br>
         </br>

  None of the above makes any sense. There are excellent videos of the takeoff. The aircraft was rock solid in yaw. The takeoff roll and rotation appear normal. Had the flaps been up they would have had a tail strike before getting airborne. The videos show a normal takeoff roll, normal rotation and normal initial climb. At some point below 200 feet AGL all thrust is lost. Here is a video of what a single engine failure looks like before reaching acceleration height. Note also how the wing looks when it reaches about the same distance the Air India video is shot from. At flaps five they appear up.

     A self-anointed one. He has as much credibility as an aviation expert as Elmer Fudd. That\x92s why the post and video were removed and discussion about anything he raises concluded.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     This thread is now meandering in the absence of further information.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Elmer Fudd (an alternative spelling of "PhD") by all accounts knows a thing or two about a thing or two, aerodynamics of ducks, and ballistics, at the 12-Ga, birdshot level at least. That is a step above GT.
  <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
   <li>
    There is zero reason for the engines to have to be DOA before rotate. A point of note will be a close look at the elevator deflection at rotate, and that alone would put paid to such a position.
   </li>
   <li>
    The engines being lost shortly after rotate is consistent with the video from the NE met sensor camera.
   </li>
   <li>
    Determining the liftoff point by ADSB without adding a correction for the flow change at the PS sensor due to AOA is going to give nonsense, and that appears to be the case. The video gives a fair, not brilliant geometry to shoot a transit sighting of the aircraft at liftoff, and that is before the point that GT states.
   </li>
   <li>
    I am impressed that GT has the deceleration rates for a B787 gear down, flaps at 5, for zero thrust. I know what it is for gear up, gear down, not so much, but it will be on the prompt side of ugly.
   </li>
   <li>
    Undertaking an MLE estimate of the kinematics, do add the change for AOA if assuming a deceleration rate. You can get away with a rough overall estimate, but then lets not "gild the Lilly" by assuming accuracy at the decimal point level.
   </li>
   <li>
    Every sensor has measurement errors, position errors, and granularity factors when converting to an output, accuracy to multiple decimal points just looks tacky.
   </li>
   <li>
    The weight of the aircraft, if it is within +/-2% of the actual is doing pretty well, we have analysed baby puppy FAA aircraft that alter their actual weight by over 6% depending on whether they are using EASA weights for PLD, or FAA, or maybe the aircraft just happen to suffer from Coriolis.
   </li>
   <li>
    GT's heart is in the right place, I don't agree with much of what he says, but then my wife doesn't agree with me often either, so maybe that is inconclusive.
   </li>
  </ol>
  We remain in the same holding pattern with a curious event that was recorded in daylight, and from which the recorders are recovered. The answers will start "flowing" "short"ly I guess.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the past 30 years, we have collectively bagged Boeing in increasing measure, for doing what all corporations are obliged to do; the board is answerable to the investors, and the investors have a "10-second Tom" event horizon when it comes to their earnings. It is little wonder that the race to the bottom is being won by Boeing, it is what Wall Street demands, and in the end, after the bones of the OEM are picked clean by those that do such things on the carcasses of once great US engineering giants, then they will bitch and moan about the losses to shareholders while they pocket the profit of their profession, fleecing the investors. L-M has been better in managing the milking of the public purse, and maybe that is the way it should be.

  This is my latest attempt to square the circle using all the data points and minimal assumptions. The main shortcoming of the analysis is not knowing the maximum L/D and the speed for maximum LD with the gear down, flaps 5, and the RAT extended. However, if I use a reasonable number in my opinion for the L/D in that configuration and assume that the airplane is being flown at the speed for it, it will not get to the crash site. The distance from the runway of the crash site is from a previous graphic (1.55 km); the rotation point from fdr, permalink 314; 200 feet max height above the runway being generally accepted; crash site 50 feet below the runway elevation cited previously. An average speed of 180 knots is consistent with the dimensions given and 30 seconds flight time. A flare at 50 feet will briefly increase the L/D to 20, maybe even 30 (500 feet more than shown) but still not enough to make up the shortfall, In fact, with a head wind the L/D will be lower than assumed as well as if the speed being flown is higher or lower than required for maximum L/D in that configuration. In other words, there must have been some thrust available.

  Two points:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  1) I had seen the "50 feet below runway" referenced as well, and double-checked on Google Earth, and could not confirm this. The terrain looks reasonably level. I'd be happy to see evidence for this claim, but until I do, I'll think it's false.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  2) The maximum L/D is given for optimal speed, which remains constant throughout the glide. In the AI171 case, drag is balanced not just by loss of altitude (as it is in the optimal glide), but also by loss of speed. The speed decline provides energy, and I suspect that makes up the shortfall you assign to thrust.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Note that kinetic energy is proportional to v\xb2, i.e. a speed loss of 50 knots from 180 to 130 vs 50 to 0 provides 15500 vs 2500 units of energy, i.e. 6 times as much. If you hypothetically hurl a unpowered aircraft into the sky with a catapult (and if there was no drag), hurling it at 180 knots makes it go 6 times as high by the time its speed decays to 130 knots than it could ever go if you hurled it at 50 knots. Of course there's drag in reality, and that also varies with v\xb2, so this is a very theoretical consideration intended to calibrate your expectations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I remember that someone used some kind of tool to confirm that the aircraft could've gone unpowered for as long as we assume it did, but of course I can't find it again now. :-(

  I also don't see any evidence that engine driven fuel pumps alone must be able to handle this scenario: provide enough fuel flow for takeoff and climb, even while the pitch is rotating, even in a hot environment with significant weight, even while the gear is stuck down.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I know that the engine driven pumps have documented limitations and that the regulations allow for some limitations. I know that at least one of these limitation is high altitude and I _suspect_ that the design intends for this unlikely scenario (engine driven fuel pumps alone with no AC pumps) to guarantee enough fuel flow to get to an airport and land. I also suspect that the APU is expected to solve loss of all AC generators - and as we know, there wasn't enough time for it to start in this scenario.

  I believe that particular bug is fixed, though it's always possible there's other issues causing a total AC loss.
  <br>
   <br>
    Not really relevant to what you quoted though, as the scenario in question requires:
    <ul>
     <li>
      Engines running on centre tank fuel during takeoff
      <i>
       while the aircraft is operating normally
      </i>
      <ul>
       <li>
        We don't know for certain if this is the case. It seems to be but it's not something that happens on other families.
       </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li>
      Then, total AC failure stopping fuel boost pumps.
     </li>
     <li>
      Engines suction feed from contaminated/full-of-water wing tanks.
     </li>
    </ul>

       <br>
        <br>
         I know that the engine driven pumps have documented limitations and that the regulations allow for some limitations. I know that at least one of these limitation is high altitude and I _suspect_ that the design intends for this unlikely scenario (engine driven fuel pumps alone with no AC pumps) to guarantee enough fuel flow to get to an airport and land. I also suspect that the APU is expected to solve loss of all AC generators - and as we know, there wasn't enough time for it to start in this scenario.

     The aircraft has two engines and should be able to climb out on one, plus it dropped like a
     <i>
      rock
     </i>
     . 'Significantly degraded' thrust isn't really compatible with what we saw. You'd also expect the engines to recover pretty quickly as it leveled off.
     <br>
      <br>
       The limitations at high altitude are primarily air/volatiles degassing out of the fuel. That's not going to be much of an issue at sea level, even if the engines are a bit higher up during rotation.
       <br/>
       APU is a nice-to-have; it's on the MEL. If you lose all four generators, it's because of some major carnage in the electrical software/hardware and chances of putting the APU on line even if it's operating are very slim.

     This is my latest attempt to square the circle using all the data points and minimal assumptions. The main shortcoming of the analysis is not knowing the maximum L/D and the speed for maximum LD with the gear down, flaps 5, and the RAT extended. However, if I use a reasonable number in my opinion for the L/D in that configuration and assume that the airplane is being flown at the speed for it, it will not get to the crash site. The distance from the runway of the crash site is from a previous graphic (1.55 km); the rotation point from fdr, permalink 314; 200 feet max height above the runway being generally accepted; crash site 50 feet below the runway elevation cited previously. An average speed of 180 knots is consistent with the dimensions given and 30 seconds flight time. A flare at 50 feet will briefly increase the L/D to 20, maybe even 30 (500 feet more than shown) but still not enough to make up the shortfall, In fact, with a head wind the L/D will be lower than assumed as well as if the speed being flown is higher or lower than required for maximum L/D in that configuration. In other words, there must have been some thrust available.

  You overlooked that they (the pilots) were trading speed for range/time. The aircraft slowed down by around 50kts while gliding. That is a lot of extra energy to use for range. It's visible in the video that the AoA slowly increases during the glide (I don't mean the flare at the end).

  There is easily-correctable available data with the aircraft's altitude at pretty much the end of the runway and it is not at 200 feet (it's around 100\xb112.5 feet).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As the aircraft visibly continues to climb past that height (and for a longer period than ADS-B data covers, if the camera's perspective casts doubt on that), it seems rather clear to me that it reached its peak height past the end of the runway.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In light of this I find the fact that people keep calculating a glide
  <i>
   from the runway
  </i>
  to the crash site to be a bit strange. Wouldn't the first step of any math be to try to determine
  <i>
   where
  </i>
  it started descending?

     Thrust is non-linear and complex. Reaction engines (i.e. fans, props) are generally most efficient at minimum power - lowest excess velocity. Turbine engines are generally most efficient at high power. These cancel out somewhere in the middle. With two engines at low power, you also don't have the drag from the dead engine or the drag from the rudder countering yaw.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Cavitating destroys pumps rapidly - someone upthread said replacing the fuel pump immediately is SOP if it has suction fed. Expect end of life in tens of hours rather than tens of thousands.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Some aircraft have switched to using jet/venturi pumps powered by returned fuel, like the A220. The electric boost pumps there are mainly for redundancy and are shut down in cruise; only one in each wing tank. Some A320s replace the centre override pumps with venturi transfer pumps.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Thanks for the clarifications
  <br/>
  <br/>
  My question is then: what is the minimum loss of thrust in both engines (perhaps more relevantly expressed as a % in fuel flow reduction from expected) that could produce the profile we saw. I appreciate this is a figure with many variables including timing and rate of loss.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The reason I think this question is relevant is because we pretty much have 2 prevailing theories at this point:
  <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
   <li>
    A failure, or reduction of thrust (below idle, indicated by loss of AC generators), that somehow impacted both engines, within 20s of rotation (explaining the RAT and gear orientation)
   </li>
   <li>
    Somehow a loss of all AC power, leading somehow to a reduction of thrust or failure of engines (both engines impacted identically is assumed in this scenario since all AC is lost), and was of course below the minimum thrust needed to fly with gear down at this weight and temperature
   </li>
  </ol>
  I agree that if it is
  <i>
   completely infeasible
  </i>
  that loss of all AC power could do anything but cause thrust reduction of X where thrust minus X is not enough, even with gear down in high temperature and significant weight at the critical moment of takeoff to cause the profile we saw, then theory 2 is invalidated. I would love to invalidate any of the theories here but I do think some specific calculations, simulations or test data is needed

     One item in the report is the position of the LG Lever - Down.
     <br/>
     Given the lack of a full transcript, and in trying to defend the crewmembers

     , Is it possible that at the point of "Positive Rate - Gear Up" - PM Brain farted, and performed a different muscle memory action? Thus they would deny moving the Switches - and take a few seconds to compute what they just did?

  The landing gear lever is forward and up on the centre instrument panel, adjacent to the PFD. The two fuel control switches are aft and low, on the thrust pedestal. There's no reasonable way to confuse one for the other in terms of position, hand movement or 'muscle memory'.

  No there is not. Further investigation will likely see if the locking detents were in a decent state or not. TBQH, such a switch should be properly guarded. Like a Embraer is, like other types that one sees with switches one has to lift a guard to operate and is locked on with the guard in position. Boeing designers found out again in not making processes fool proof?

     And for those who scoff at the possibility of the PM inadvertently operating the cutoff switches (which is done as frequently as operating the gear lever), I\x92d remind you that more than one Airbus has landed with its parking brake on after the PM inadvertently set it rather than arming the spoilers.

     Regardless of how this happened I find it perplexing that a switch with such consequence in either position can be operated with a flick of the wrist.
     <br/>
     Firewall shutoff switches are guarded, fire bottle switches are guarded or require both hands to operate, all require two deliberate actions to operate, except two switches in the middle of the console which do so many consrquential things..
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  They have a reasonably substantial pull-out gate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Over-guarding stuff can have its own issues. People become used to operating the guard as part of normal operations, and it becomes muscle memory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apparently Embraer aircraft inhibit the shutoff switch if the thrust lever is above idle - if you have a stuck thrust lever, you need to use the fire shutoff.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another option would be to have a blocking solenoid (with override button) similar to the landing gear lever while airborne or at high speed.

     3 possibilities come to mind:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     1. Pilot who moved fuel switches to off did not do so intentionally to cause the outcome, but for some reason unknown.............somehow confused the action of retracting gear with shutdown procedure at end of flight..
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  This crossed my mind too. This is called an "action-slip" by designers: a valid and frequently practised action being applied to entirely the wrong situation, resulting in an (extremely) invalid action.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On this flight, the relative drop in noise and calm that follows the landing gear doors closing after the gear retracts during the initial climb, might have caused an action slip by PIC to perform the engine shut-down procedure used when parking on stand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Unlikely though, I would hope.

  The gear were never retracted on this flight, so the action being caused by gear up quietness is not feasible.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Action slip in general... technically possible, but there should still be no actions being taken other than gear up (and probably still a bit early for that).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Engines off instead of gear up is one hell of an action slip.

      This might have been discussed but as has been suggested upthread; a possible scenario is that at some point, PIC took their hands off the thrust levers and/or placed them in a guarding position behind the thrust levers at their base - but by doing so unfortunately nudged the Fuel cut-off switches to 'Off' - perhaps 'helped' by there either being incorrectly fitted locking mechanisms or worn locking mechanisms ?

  Come on! The gear never moved! You're an Airbus pilot; do you really think that could happen? If so, would the captain then sit there fat, dumb and happy wondering what was now going on... for 10 seconds? Even I would say "Sh1t" and whip those fuel switches back on quicker than the FO could say "WTF!".

  Mods, if you don't lock the thread, I'm going back to Facebook!
