     One example of fuel contamination causing a significant loss of thrust on both engines at low altitude.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     But it seems extremely unlikely for contaminated fuel to impact both engines at
     <i>
      exactly
     </i>
     the same time, with no asymmetry and no surges or smoke.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     What can cause a sudden catastrophic loss of thrust on both engines at exactly the same time?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Birds (but no apparent surges)
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Inadvertent movement of the fuel cut off switches (which would be an incredible error but I suppose it could conceivably be muscle memory having done so recently after the last leg&hellip;weirder things have happened. Remember the 767 events of the late 80s)
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Intentional shutdown of the engines (pilot suicide has happened before)
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Some catastrophic electrical/FADEC/engine interface failure (which I highly doubt is feasible in a modern 1309 aircraft)
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I can&rsquo;t think of any others&hellip;
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  This seems to be the best summary so far. Based on the detail of the mayday its probably time to rule out the flaps, load shift, and other suggestions. Latest news is a quote from the survivor:
  <i>
   "
   <span style="color:#000000">
    Suddenly, the lights started flickering &ndash; green and white &ndash; then the plane rammed into some establishment that was there"
   </span>
  </i>
  <span style="color:#000000">
   .
  </span>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I cant think of any reason for electrical failure and "no thrust" (as per statements) without any visual cues other than (a) suicide, or (b) starvation. Is there any electrical failure that can cause fuel valves to close? I dont fly Boeing, so can any Dreamliner driver explain what conditions could trigger an overspeed and auto engine shutdown (quote from Google below)? Would short runway, and hot/low QNH do it? Also, what happened to the order demanding a full power down/recycle every 51 days?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <i>
   <span style="color:#080809">
    The EEC has build in protections to protect the engine. One of these protections is the Engine Overspeed Protection, when the core engine exceeds 120% the EEC shuts off the fuel to the applicable engine.

     One has to assume that, given the seeming lack of lateral deviation from the flight path, and with no obvious yawing or rudder input visible on the videos, there's only two realistic conclusions here? Simultaneous dual engine failure of unknown cause if the RAT was indeed deployed; or flaps reduced too early leading to a stall if the RAT wasn't deployed.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Evidence in this thread would lean me toward the RAT deployed and therefore dual engine out scenario. As for the cause of that, well, only a couple of likely scenarios exist that could cause simultaneous shutdown of both engines, including mistaken or intentional use of the fuel cutoff levers.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I would rule out bird strike for lack of audio visual signatures of such an event and fuel contamination due to symmetry of events. Due to my trust in the profession and my distrust in modern engineering practices, my money is on Seattle.

     OK, another hour spent going through all the posts since I was on last night...
     <br/>
     I won't quote the relevant posts as they go back ~15 pages, but a few more comments:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     TAT errors affecting N1 power set: The FADEC logic (BTW, this is pretty much common on all Boeing FADEC) will use aircraft TAT if it agrees with the dedicated engine inlet temp probe -
     <i>
      but if they differ it will use the engine probe
     </i>
     . The GE inlet temp probe is relatively simple and unheated, so (unlike a heated probe) a blocked or contaminated probe will still read accurately - just with greater 'lag' to actual temperature changes.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     TCMA - first off, I have to admit that this does look rather like an improper TCMA activation, but that is very, very unlikely. For those who don't know, TCMA is a system to shutdown a runaway engine that's not responding to the thrust lever - basic logic is an engine at high power with the thrust lever at/near idle, and the engine not decelerating. However, TCMA is
     <i>
      only
     </i>
     active on the ground (unfamiliar with the 787/GEnx TCMA air/ground logic - on the 747-8 we used 5 sources of air/ground - three Radio Altimeters and two Weight on Wheels - at least
     <i>
      one of each
     </i>
     had to indicate ground to enable TCMA). TCMA will shutdown the engine via the N2 overspeed protection - nearly instantaneous. For this to be TCMA, it would require at least two major failures - improper air ground indication or logic, and improper TCMA activation logic (completely separate software paths in the FADEC). Like I said, very, very unlikely.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Fuel contamination/filter blockage: The fuel filters have a bypass - if the delta P across the filter becomes excessive, the filter bypasses and provides the contaminated fuel to the engine. Now this contaminated fuel could easy foul up the fuel metering unit causing a flameout, but to happen to two engines at virtually the same time would be tremendous unlikely.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Auto Thrust thrust lever retard - the TO lockup in the logic makes this very unlikely (it won't unlock below (IIRC) 400 ft., and even that requires a separate pilot action such as a mode select change or thrust lever movement). And if it did somehow happen, all the pilot needs to do is push the levers back up.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Engine parameters on the FDR: I don't know what exactly is on the 787 FDR with regards to engine parameters, but rest assured that there is plenty of engine data that gets recorded - most at one/second. Getting the FDR readout from a modern FDR is almost an embarrassment of riches. Assuming the data is intact, we'll soon have a very good idea of what the engines were doing
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  The speed at which there was a complete loss of thrust and electrical power degrading to the point of flickering lights and RAT deployment suggests to me an actual engine shutdown rather than anything linked to auto thrust or fuel contamination. There are not many things which can cause an engine to shut down: LP valves, FADEC incl TCMA, crew action\x85

  Something I've been wondering about this accident is the phase of the flight where the apparent power loss happened. It seems like the engines were running normally through the takeoff, until the aircraft lifted off the ground. After that the loss of power seemed to happen very quickly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Could there be a scenario where aircraft's fuel supply is interrupted by change in aircraft's attitude (for example faulty pumps, partially contaminated fuel)? Frankly I have no idea how 787's fuel pumps operate, or if fuel contamination could happen in a way that blocks the flow only when aircraft reaches certain nose-up attitude.

     Air crashes are "unlikely" a priori. Therefore I think the root cause, when determined, will be something unlikely. Best case, we learn something practical that can be mitigated in the future.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  To be clear, I am talking about the probability,
  <b>
   given this crash has happened
  </b>
  , that a particular item could be a cause.
  <br/>
  The probability of something (or maybe several somethings) being a primary cause of this crash is near unity. The question, what possible causes are likely?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To take a specific item of speculation that might case dual engine rollback, fuel contamination was suggested. I don't remember all the points made in this context, but some were: no other aircraft presumably using the same fuel supply had issues; why would both engines apparently fail near simultaneously?; why would they fail just after rotation?; and so on. The consensus seemed to be, not impossible, but unlikely (presumably in the sense I just described).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Accidental (or even deliberate) fuel shutoff was also suggested. Again, the consensus seemed to be, possible, but unlikely for this type, since previous ergonomic causes of such accidental shutoff had long since been addressed.

     Trying repeatedly to follow the whole thread plus updates but loading on the iPhone constantly jumps backwards and forwards making it a struggle to cover everything.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Two points which may or may not have relevance. One is just before the final crash, a dark-looking cover(?) flies up into the air. Could this be the first contact with sound that the surviving passenger alleges he heard?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Secondly the cost of aviation fuel seems to be comparatively more expensive in India than either Japan (leg before) or the UK (following leg). Would this effect refuelling procedures within India, supposing a company directive to save when possible?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     (Frequent long-haul passenger.)
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Good grief! They uploaded less fuel to save money??? That made the plane immediately sink to oblivion&hellip;because what? They ran out of fuel? You think airports all over India restrict fuel and endanger countless aircraft daily? It is the Captain&rsquo;s prerogative to sign off on fuel upload.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But let&rsquo;s run with it. Less fuel = lighter load. So&hellip;how does that make lift off/climb a more difficult procedure??? It shouid have been easier. How does that result in rapid loss of lift? Did they finish their tablespoon of fuel?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Or - if you are hinting at fuel contamination by being &ldquo;watered down&rdquo; somehow&hellip;why were no other aircraft affected? You might wish to consider Cathay Pacific flight 780, which suffered a serious fuel contamination incident. The problem was not initialiy detectable, but some engine underperformance was noted in one engine fairly early into the flght. The problems compounded during the flght from Surabaya to Hong Kong, culminating in complete engine shutdown. Fortunately, due to the experience and skill of Captain and Copilot, they just - only just - managed to land safely in Hong Kong. Point is - a crash scenario did not unfold in seconds.

  Ex petroleum lab technician and tank farm sampler here.  We would occasionally get fuel samples from crashed aircraft to test for contamination.  One test was for water and sediment/microorganism sludge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In this accident, fuel contamination continues to be dismissed as a cause, because no other aircraft have reported issues. But there has been no discussion regarding the airport's fuel storage, transfer, or filtration systems. Water and sediment naturally settles at the bottom of fuel storage tanks. If this aircraft received fuel drawn from the bottom of a storage tank,  in the absence of a proper filtration system,  it&rsquo;s possible that it was contaminated. The next aircraft may have received fuel from a different storage tank with good fuel.

  This got me thinking about a report I read where an Auckland based maintenance facility added too much biocide to an aircraft fuel tank by a factor of ten. From memory the Engineer simply read the instructions wrong or calculated the additive amount incorrectly and the cross checking systems were either not in place or they failed. I searched online for it but could only find the following;

  So my point is, if we are speculating about fuel contamination causing dual engine failure, it is possible that a fuel contaminant is specific to a particular airframe and not the supply system. Obviously not saying that is what happened here, but it goes to show how many possibilities exist.

  Fuel contamination is certainly a valid theory. The main thing working against it is that it would seem from the aircraft's flight path is that both engines failed at exactly the same time and lost thrust simultaneously. The chances of this are non zero, but remote. I say that as there appears to be no yaw, or other controlling of the aircraft - either by pilot or automation - that would suggest an asymmetric thrust scenario, even for a few seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yes, Jetstar had the biocide issue but did not immediately hit both engines within seconds of each other.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's my understanding that both engines draw fuel from independent sources during that time (which may be fed from a common source (eg central tank). But again, the odds of both failing at the exact same instant is low, but not zero.

  I'm no aircraft engineer but aren't tanks read by a capacitive system. Water in that quantity, having a greater dielectric constant than jet fuel (I'd like to say \xd7100) will show an impossible amount of fuel on the gauges.
  <br/>
  Also, for them to fail at exactly the same time with near full tanks (as evidenced from the explosion) doesn't give much credence to the contaminated fuel theory in my opinion.

  How is misselected flap still being discussed? Misselected flap does not cause gear retraction to cease nor cause the RAT to deploy. Both of which are (subjectively) evidenced in the videos. What is the supporting evidence for misselected flap?

  Yes absolutely. 100% catastrophic loss of power when getting airborne. No evidence for bird strikes\x85no severe eng damage symptoms in the videos, no mention of birds in the mayday\x85
  <br/>
  <br/>
  they\x92ve gone TO power all the way to rotate, no power issues, no eng fuel issues, but as soon as its wheels off they lose all power. That can\x92t be coincidental. TCMA certainly fits this scenario especially with ground/air logic.

  I&rsquo;m not a 787 driver so for fear of looking dumb in front of those that are this still confuses me. Even IF they&rsquo;ve mis-selected the flap setting (I still don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s been cemented on here that there is in fact a FMS/flap setting disagreement warning but i believe there is), had the wrong de-rated take off settings, selected flaps instead of gear up the 787 with massive high bypass engines, FBW and full envelope protections surely cannot let itself be put in such a low energy/high alpha regime as we saw in the videos IF it has both fans functioning normally, surely?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  the pilots may have messed up royally and numerous times so those holes lined up but the plane is the final block in the chain and a 21st century all digital entirely clean sheet design was sold as being immune to such catastrophic outcomes from a few minor (consequential yes) and fairly common errors- aren&rsquo;t all the protections and our procedures designed after decades of mistakes?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  im having a hard time squaring how a fully functioning modern bird like this could allow for this outcome and almost whatever the pilots did outside of unbelievable inputs and the pilots are are a bit of a red herring IMO

     No. The LE slats are deployed therefore the flaps are as well. This is an automatic linkage. The flaps are set at Take-Off. Hard to see from the angle but they are...if slats are out (easy to see) then flaps are set. Looks like Flaps 5. Also, the 787 has the highest Thrust-to-Weight ratio of any airliner on Earth. The change in Alpha and lift is a trifling matter for it, at these settings (1-5). It will fly out of it easily, even at that density altitude. The attitude change is - in the circumstances I describe, consistent with a massive power loss (both sides). I believe based on probability that simultaneous mechanical failure is not the cause. Fuel contamination or starvation is likewise unlikely based on the 787 fuel system. The common element is the FADEC/Autothrottle/TOGO. However, each engine FADEC is dual redundant two channels. So any such common failure must happen further upstream. From a design perspective, that would be unthinkable. But this is Boeing. Given what I can see with my own eyes, I believe the flap issue is a non-starter. Also, re the landing gear: Clearly the Positive Rate challenge would be met based on normal rotation and fly-off at V2. But since we know the flaps were set correctly, that rules out an "oopsie" moment. Just as likely there was at the challenge moment an indication that something was amiss, and the Gear Up call was not made. They see both N1s unwinding and it takes a second to get past the WFT factor. They cross-check and see the airspeed also unwinding. Then they unload the Alpha and pitch to gear down Vy. And they had another 6 seconds. Whatever it was, it was not a flap, mechanical or fuel issue. We will know soon enough. But this is Boeing. My gut says "software". All 787s worldwide need to be grounded, now.

  Hello all,
  <br/>
  I personally think this is a good summary of what we can ascertain at this point from the evidence we have.
  <br/>
  I am not a 787 driver by any means but with a fair bit of aviation experience. I would be interested in any thoughts on this suggestion regarding loss of thrust:
  <br/>
  If we take it as a reasonable assumption as above that it is almost simultaneous loss of significant thrust, and for the good reasons already discussed, it is pretty unlikely that from what we can see/analyse, that the cause of this would be bird strike (expect to see some signs on video if it's significant enough to cause double engine failure) nor fuel contamination (reasons as above re: likelihood, other ac affected and simultaneous nature). TCMA I don't know enough about but it seems that the sensor redundancy/logic protection is so high it would not be the sole cause.
  <br/>
  On this basis, should we perhaps consider the causality of a total electrics failure of some kind first, leading to deployment of the RAT, gear retraction cease etc. Clearly the independent FADEC power generation systems would mean this doesn't on its own prevent thrust control of the engines but could we then be looking at cascading faults (possibly exacerbated by latent faults below the MEL/defect threshold) that contribute to dual power loss and sensor/system issues in throttle response not resulting in FADEC commands to the engines to increase thrust. So even at that point 'firewalling' the throttles could tragically not recover the situation?
  <br/>
  Very happy to be corrected by those with much more experience and understanding of big jets operations and systems!

  Can anyone familiar with the 787 built in overspeed protections comment on what could possibly override a pilots TOGA button command or fire walling the throttles?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I am presuming that at some point just prior to the mayday call the pilots would have just commanded \x91full\x92 thrust and received no or a significantly mild response.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I don\x92t think fuel contamination, birds or anything else external to the aircraft affected this crash. There is no evidence of it.

  could some combination of already MEL items and one or more faulty inputs to the computers cause the aircraft to \x91protect\x92 itself into the ground? Regardless of throttle position?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I am thinking - ground/air logic, faulty airspeed sense, faulty AoA sense or other.

     It's controlled by Software and I've seen enough very weird "corner case" bugs that I discount nothing when Software is involved. I am sure there are more likely explanations why all power was lost (Assuming that was the case) but nothing would surprise me!

  So are we now saying total loss of AC power for the RAT activation and activation of TCMA on two very independent engines for the power loss? What are the chances..
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I can buy the AC power loss, but TCMA activation as well - That\x92s a stretch. TCMA is available on the ground and on approach and will activate if the engine thrust doesn\x92t follow the Thrust Lever command. On the ground it will shut the engine down (think RTO with engine stuck at T/O). On approach it will reduce the thrust if the engine doesn\x92t respond to the Thrust Lever command ala Cathay Pacific A330 (CMB - HKG) with the fuel contamination incident.

     I keep reading this theory and I'm baffled. You think the PF is going to attempt a dual engine shutoff and relight during the initial climb based on a hunch that the engines have quit, all without even a sideways glance to see what N1 is or a short word with the PM?

  I don't want to believe it either. It defies belief but given certain confirmation bias (sim), panic and inexperience by the FO, it's not beyond the realms of possibility. It explains both the RAT and loss of lift. The alternative right now is a catastrophic electrical failure that wiped out the engines or engine control leading to loss of thrust, or a dual engine failure due to birds, fuel contamination or FOD. They are also valid, though IMO less likely.

  How about TCMA shuts down both engines for some unknown reason, then AC power fails and RAT deploys. I agree is very low probability but these very low probability events have happened in the past. I just posted AA191 as one example...

  There's some possible fuel contamination mechanisms which would only affect one aircraft
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - The fuel truck&rsquo;s water-absorbing &ldquo;monitor&rdquo; element breaks up, the first aircraft after the break gets the bead slug; later uplifts may be clear once the hose is flushed. The beads jam metering valves almost immediately.
  <br/>
  - After pipe maintenance, the first few hundred litres can carry residual cleaning surfactant that strips protective films and causes filter-monitor &ldquo;soap lock&rdquo;.
  <br/>
  - Biofilm growth happens inside one aircraft&rsquo;s wing tanks when it sits in humid conditions or does short hops with warm fuel. On the next flight the biofilm shears off, blocks strainers,
