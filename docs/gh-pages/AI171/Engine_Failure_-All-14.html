     Aryan Asari, the 17-year-old who filmed the crash from his father's rooftop, gave his original interview earlier in the week to BBC Gujarati, i.e in Gujarati language.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I believe they're native speakers professional pilots on Pprune who might have read or could find the original piece. Could they help to clarify Aryan's statements in English?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     More of this eyewitness' statements in Gujarati also might NOT have been translated into English. Maybe worth checking for added value. Thanks.

  BBC's article quotes him as saying the shaking or moving left and right . But on more fresh interviews he didn't say that . He was assuming the plane was landing since it was his first time there . He came an hour before . He wanted to take video for his friends back at the village .  Apparently this is a phenomenon called Misinformation Effect "where well-documented phenomenon in psychology that describes the tendency for post-event information to interfere with and alter a person's memory of an original event."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Grand mother was the one saying it was shaking . She said her location was even closer to the airport  . She also said the plane was silent compared to how others make the sound

     I wonder if those reported eight Air Indian 787-8's pulled in for 'looking at', have had any issues with failed power systems, as in the reported and video of this aircraft, having no IFE systems working.,

  I really think this is worth looking at. I keep asking a maintenance engineer to comment on what they'd do if a 787 with these issues presented itself to them on a turnaround shift and whether those faults could be connected to engine failure in some way.

  The short answer is no.
  <br/>
  The 787 has a very sophisticated diagnostic system. Faults are presented through a central maintenance computer system accessible either through the flight deck display units or from a laptop plugged in to the aircraft (there is a WiFi option but honestly it's a bit clunky and I've only ever used it once).
  <br/>
  All faults are displayed in ATA order as either active, not active or latched faults.
  <br/>
  I cannot see how any IFE, lighting, air con or other non power plant related faults could cause the situation that has brought this aircraft down.
  <br/>
  The IFE is entirely seperate and has its own independent diagnostic system.

     I was struck by a comment in this or the earlier thread that I cannot now find. It was to the effect &ndash; I&rsquo;m paraphrasing &ndash; that fuel shut off results in an almost immediate cessation of thrust. (Please correct my paraphrasing if I&rsquo;m off track.) I was also struck by how quiet the aircraft was in the original video, except for the RAT. (Or was it a motorcycle? Sorry couldn&rsquo;t resist. Just joking&hellip;)
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Someone earlier asked how the aircraft could have kept climbing if both engines stopped very late in the take-off roll or shortly after take-off. My answer: Momentum.

  explained that earlier: T/O power to sub idle on fuel shutoff only takes 1s, at most 2s.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Slamming the throttles back is a lot slower as the FCU (on a traditional engine)/FADEC spins down the engine slowly - I suppose to make sure that the airflow through the engine remains stable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Regarding the momentum: As the first few seconds of the climb were normal compared to previous T/Os of the same flight (speed &amp; altitude, confirmed by comparison of the RAW ADS-B data) I don't believe the engine failure happened before or on lift-off.

  I agree with this. For all the SLF reading and not posting ( good work!) there is a delay between the end of the takeoff run and the gear being selected up. I fly 737&rsquo;s so any 78 folk feel free to correct me but it looks like this;
  <br/>
  PM: &ldquo; V1 &hellip;.Rotate&rdquo;
  <br/>
  The PF then begins to rotate the aircraft up to a pre determined attitude which is normally between 13 and 15 degrees. They do this at a rate of between 2 and 3 degrees per second so about 5 or 6 seconds later the aircraft is at its climb out attitude. The PM is then looking at their instruments to confirm that the aircraft has a positive rate of climb, this takes a moment, maybe 1 to 3 seconds then;
  <br/>
  PM &ldquo; positive rate&rdquo;
  <br/>
  PF: &ldquo; gear up&rdquo;.
  <br/>
  So minimum 8 seconds but probably longer between the PM calling &ldquo;rotate&rdquo; and the gear being selected up.
  <br/>
  The relevance of all that is to say that if you suspect that the gear up cycle has been interrupted by a dual engine failure, then the engines may well have been producing thrust up to an altitude of 50-100ft or so, which ties in nicely with the max height reached, distance travelled etc.
  <br/>
  Mods this is clearly not a theory, just info for those who don&rsquo;t fly airliners to aid understanding.

  Could you please elaborate on that?

  FR24 did do that raw ADS-B data comparison. Remember the GPS position and barometric altitude are sent by the aircraft itself. The altitude is sent in 25 ft intervals, so a shallow curve that is smooth in reality looks janky in the data, due to the rounding of the numbers. From

     We&rsquo;ve taken data from AI171 departures for the month prior to the accident flight&mdash;including two previous operations by VT-ANB&mdash;and overlaid their departure paths on the data from AI171 on 12 June. The accident flight is in red, while all other flights are the blue paths. The data shown here is the uncalibrated barometric altitude, so the data is not above ground level, but it is consistent to itself.
    </span>

  The red line is the accident flight, and it covers approximately 4.3 seconds.
  <br/>
  Obviously the altitudes are all uncorrected for barometric pressure, which would've varied with the weather on that day; you kind of have to mentally shift the lines vertically downward. Now I looked for, but couldn't find, the post in the old thread where the rotation was triangulated\xb9, but I remember that it was near the turnoff to the high-speed taxiway, so a few seconds ahead of this ADS-B capture. We only have the video to show us what occurred then.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That means the ADS-B data doesn't really tell us whether the first few seconds of the climb were normal or not.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When we compare the red line to the blue lines, the data tells us the climb rate had already decayed significantly before the accident aircraft passed over the end of the runway, because the red flight path is much more shallow than the blue flight paths.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Please correct me if I'm wrong: to my eye, the data alone does not show that the engines must have failed after rotation, because the data does not demonstrate a normal climb rate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But likewise, the engines can't have failed much before rotation:

     This aircraft has got airborne well within the requirements of FAR 25 under which it was certified. It has over 1250m ahead of it passing around 35' based on the video from behind, so the FMC data was not incorrect, the thrust up until after TO was not incorrect, and the CG is not out of range, the time to rotate is within expected range, and the attitude at liftoff is not excessive, the plane is not heavier than expected.
    </div>
   </div>

  For completeness' sake: you can look at the CCTV video, consider the 787's wingspan a flying 200 ft yardstick, and hopefully agree that the aircraft did not get much higher than 200 ft AAL, if that.

     You can triangulate the camera location using the aircraft holding short for takeoff and the road sign. Then draw a line from there just to the right of the instrumentation building and you'll find the aircraft rotated with about 4000 feet of runway remaining (11000+ runway length).

  There has been a lot of discussion of the possibility that the crew shut down the wrong engine or misidentified some other problem as an engine failure, usually followed by an assertion that nobody would touch the engines before x feet. PPRuNe's own survey, at the top of this very subforum, found a really high base rate of wrong engine incidents:
  <ul>
   <li>
    31 per cent of the PPRuNe Population reported either having a wrong-engine incident or a close call
   </li>
   <li>
    61 per cent reported witnessing one
   </li>
  </ul>
  This might be biased upwards by people who have had the experience being more likely to engage with a thread about it and to respond to the survey, although on the other hand the difference between self-reported errors and witnessed ones shows there's also some bias to under-reporting. In the light of those observations you should surely have quite a strong prior that an erroneous engine shutdown is possible.

  Also, on the point about sitting on your hands to 400/1000 feet AAL, someone who has already deviated from a standard operating procedure is more likely to go on to make another mistake; that is why the procedure existed in the first place.

  Hi all,
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Disclaimer: I read this thread from hour 1, still scratching my head regarding perf though.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I know sound analysis points to higher odds being a dual engine failure with RAT deployed, however I still have some questions if anyone is available to enlighten.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  So, my questions is related to T/O performance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Is it possible on the 787 to calculate perf in the OPT for F15/20 T/O, and to enter F5 T/O speed on the FMC ?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By that I mean do normal procedure, but at the point where you are suppose to enter flaps, CG speed ect&hellip;. You, out of habit (if F5 is indeed a habit on the 787) enter F5, but F15/20 speeds ? Or would there be a warning that you have manually inputed speeds that are not correct for the selected flaps and conditions inputed in the FMC ?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thanks for the help !

  The requirement for TCMA may have been specified by Boeing, but that doesn' t tell us who designed and built the solution in this case, though it must have been a collaborative effort between the two parties. Anyway, TCMA may be a red herring, since we still have not defined what, if any, other sources would have authority to issue an engine shutdown command

  The "requirement" for TCMA was "specified" by the FAA. Manufacturers seeking certification of aeronautical products subject to the requirements then had no choice but to design and instal systems that met the FAA's certification requirements.

  I'm pretty sure it's clear what "sources", other than TCMA systems if any, have "authority to issue an engine shutdown command", though it does depend on what you mean by "engine shutdown".

  I don&rsquo;t think that is clear at all. The shutdown hypothesis, if true, both engines, makes it likely that they were commanded to do so. While the discussion has centered around the TCMA subsystem, if other subsystems have the ability to do that, they need to be defined and looked at as well.

  There\x92s at least N2 overspeed protection that actually uses the same hardware as TCMA to stop the noise. There might exists crosstalk and inhibit for the N2 overspeed protection if the N2 overspeed protection has shut down the other engine. In fact it\x92s not confirmed that no such crosstalk exists in 787 TCMA system. It would complie with \x94no single fault should cause\x85\x94 certification requirements. Other than that I see no practical difference in the propability of TCMA and N2 overspeed protection to shut down both engine during take-off.

  Think about this accident from 100,000 feet. In other words, DON\x92T think about the specific root cause. We have almost no factual information to ponder at the moment but we can still ask a larger question: How did an experienced crew in a modern aircraft find themselves in a situation from which there apparently was no escape? Given the redundancies, fault tolerances, crew training, and engineering and operational controls present in modern aviation, how could it be that they happily took off in an airplane and flew it into an unsurvivable event just moments later?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This isn\x92t the first one either. On February 9, 2024 a Challenger 600 manuevering to final at Naples FL, (APF) lost both engines simultaneously and crashed on a highway short of the runway. The NTSB final report isn\x92t out yet so we don\x92t know that cause either, but the situation was the same. SOMEhow, a highly experienced crew found themselves in a situation from which there was apparently no escape. Whatever the cause was, how did it go un-detected until it produced an accident? (It\x92s NTSB accident number ERA24FA110. You can find that thread on PPRUNE by searching on Challenger 600. The preliminary NTSB report contains interesting readouts from the FDR. Yes, they lost both fans simultaneously.) I\x92m not suggesting these two accidents have related causes, I\x92m only observing that both crews apparently had no way out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I\x92m asking, \x93Whatever the flaw was that initiated these events, how did it remain un-known *until* it produced an accident?\x94 We test and re-test modern aircraft for every imaginable failure mode during the design, certification, and production process. We train and re-train techs, mechanics, flight crew, and everybody else that touches the airplane to be sure a high level of performance and safety is not compromised. Think bigger. Think about \x93the system\x94 as a whole. Apparently the system missed something. What are we not seeing?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  My condolences to all who were lost. Please keep in mind that except by the grace of God it could have been any one of us on that terrible day.

     There has been a lot of discussion of the possibility that the crew shut down the wrong engine or misidentified some other problem as an engine failure, usually followed by an assertion that nobody would touch the engines before x feet. PPRuNe's own survey, at the top of this very subforum, found a really high base rate of wrong engine incidents:
     <ul>
      <li>
       31 per cent of the PPRuNe Population reported either having a wrong-engine incident or a close call
      </li>
      <li>
       61 per cent reported witnessing one
      </li>
     </ul>
     This might be biased upwards by people who have had the experience being more likely to engage with a thread about it and to respond to the survey, although on the other hand the difference between self-reported errors and witnessed ones shows there's also some bias to under-reporting. In the light of those observations you should surely have quite a strong prior that an erroneous engine shutdown is possible.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Also, on the point about sitting on your hands to 400/1000 feet AAL, someone who has already deviated from a standard operating procedure is more likely to go on to make another mistake; that is why the procedure existed in the first place.

  A better question would related to this accident would be have you ever shut down the wrong engine below 200 feet AGL in the sim. I strongly suspect the answer would be zero percent.

  I still consider the forward truck tilt is a massive clue to a C system Hydraulic failure prior to wheels-up, which must have been caused by loss of electrics (since C is solely electrically powered), so I am still wondering if hydraulic failure happened before or after the loss of thrust.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While thinking about the consequences of a total hydraulics failure around time of rotation (caused by a suspected dual engine failure), here is a new observation. I searched the previous threads to see if anyone lese had noticed it.

  In the rooftop video, as it's just approaching the treeline, there are
  <b>
   spoiler deflections
  </b>
  visible just behind the engines on each wing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With a total hydraulics failure, the pilots control column using direct wiring, will only control this spoiler pair and the stabiliser. The RAT does not control this spoiler pair (hydraulically), only the most inboard spoilers pair. Its an interesting observation because it means this spoiler pair were being deflected electrically, either by the battery or RAT. But if the RAT provides emergency C hydraulic power why didn't the RAT powered spoilers deflect instead? Does this mean the RAT was unable to provide emergency hydraulic at such low airspeed?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I think this also re-affirms the critical loss of power (dual engine failure), and rules out many other theories. It tragically lost all power, both engines, all hydraulics and electrics (apart from battery and RAT).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I am wondering if anyone else has noticed other flight control deflections?

  Water was mentioned earlier in the previous iteration of this thread, as I recall  by one of the most well respected contributors on the forum and an expert in flight testing and certification issues. There have been a couple of well known incidents of flight deck screens going blank due to all sorts of electrical problems caused by water ingress into the E&amp;E bay, fortunately in daytime vmc and not on particularly electric jets, and both I believe at rotation. The one I recall had it&rsquo;s L1 door left open during a black rainstorm in Hong Kong. It&rsquo;s also been said that total electrical failure can&rsquo;t result in in a double engine failure on the 787, but I wonder what multiple sequelae could result from such water contamination with an aeroplane that relies so much on electrical power and software? Another very remote probability but many accidents and incidents are. I don&rsquo;t even know if there was any inclement weather before this flight, maybe someone could confirm?

     This isn&rsquo;t the first one either. On February 9, 2024 a Challenger 600 manuevering to final at Naples FL, (APF) lost both engines simultaneously and crashed on a highway short of the runway. The NTSB final report isn&rsquo;t out yet so we don&rsquo;t know that cause either, but the situation was the same. SOMEhow, a highly experienced crew found themselves in a situation from which there was apparently no escape. Whatever the cause was, how did it go un-detected until it produced an accident? (It&rsquo;s NTSB accident number ERA24FA110. You can find that thread on PPRUNE by searching on Challenger 600. The preliminary NTSB report contains interesting readouts from the FDR. Yes, they lost both fans simultaneously.) I&rsquo;m not suggesting these two accidents have related causes, I&rsquo;m only observing that both crews apparently had no way out.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     My condolences to all who were lost. Please keep in mind that except by the grace of God it could have been any one of us on that terrible day.

  I didn't read that thread, but having flown the aircraft (challenger 600 type), I believe the consensus is that the Captain reaching underneath the thrust levers to actuate the flaps can (and has) resulted in the "triggers" on the back of the thrust levers being engaged- if this is done while the FO is bringing the thrust to idle, it can result in going below the idle stop to cutoff. In other words, the engines were inadvertently shut down.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But I agree that the complete, simultaneous loss of thrust on both engines has to be an astronomical probability, and the cause is going to be interesting to say the least.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I also agree that any one of us could be put in a horrible position within seconds that would be very hard to recover from- the older I get and the more hours I spend in the air, this starts to spend more time in one's consciousness, unfortunately.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  BTW calling the crew " highly experienced" is a bit of a stretch IMO, the Captain certainly was, but 1100 hours isn't even enough for an ATP in most countries. For all we know it was not a factor, of course.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  PS, what is an SLF??

  I need to correct one of my previous posts, I was going down the path of a mismanaged engine failure after V1, however it's been demonstrated to me that this aircraft will fly away on one engine even with the gear down with better than minimum climb gradient requirement. Quite astonishing actually.
  <br/>
  That just leaves deliberate act not necessarily intentional, fuel vapour lock and automatically commanded engine shutdown.
  <br/>
  I hope the rat is found soon so we know for sure if both engines were in fact lost.
