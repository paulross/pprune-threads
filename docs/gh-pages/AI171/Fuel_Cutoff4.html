     We have an authoritative answer to that question, but only if the TCMA implemented in the FADEC used on the 787 engines functions in the way described in conceptual documents: If one of the two TCMA 'channels' for an engine 'thinks' the shut off criteria are satisfied but the other channel doesn't, the channel which 'thinks' the shut off criteria are satisfied 'wins' and the fuel shut off valve for that engine is therefore given a shut off signal.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  And each FADEC is unique to the engine in which it is hosted. So whilst these may be "autonomous" they still rely on data external to the engine itself such as WoW and Rad Alt where they hold more "sway" than they do in the flight deck.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Are these values recorded in the FDR?

     Strange, as I would have estimated this quite differently based on layman's intuition. If one assumes average values, then the approximate flight profile of AI171 according to layman's guidance certainly fits a situation in which the engines failed at or even very shortly before rotation.
    </span>
   </div>
  </div>
  IMO, if those engines failed just after rotation, there is no way that jet would have got anywhere near 200ft, especially if the fuel was "cut off", as opposed to back to Idle.

  At 420k lbs (310k lb ZFW+110k lb Fuel), the (takeoff) V2 Flap 5 is 157kts. The (landing) Vref for Flap 5 I estimate to be at least 160kts (the FCOM I have has no figures for Flap 5 landings; F20 Vref is 154; the manoeuvre speed for Flap 5 is 189). Typically, you'd probably be at V2+15 when you get established in the climb after rotation.

  No. With a pitch attitude of around 15\xb0, that's quite a bit of weight being supported not only by the wings but by the engine thrust vector. Cut that and you stop going up very quickly. Note Sailvi's comment above.

  ANY reduction in pitch attitude would cause the climb to cease immediately. These aircraft are going so slowly, relatively, and the drag is so high that any small change in pitch attitude will cause an increase in descent rate with very little increase in speed (or no lessening of deceleration).

     Wouldn't it be the case that if the thrust had only ceased five seconds after rotation, the aircraft would then have reached a good 250 ft with the engines still running and then another good 200 ft in normal conditions before the speed was used up to about 150 kn?
    </span>
   </div>
  </div>
  Not IMO. Basically, the only reason this jet is flying is because of the whopping long thrust vector out the back. It's already almost back at minimum speed anyway for flap 5 so there is very speed to trade. In this case, I wouldn't be trading anything, because the speed reduction rate would be too fast.

     AI171 probably didn't reach an altitude of 400 to 500 ft above ground (in relation to the airport), did it?

  My estimate is around 200ft (one wingspan) and I hypothesise the engines were producing plenty of thrust until about 7 seconds, before it stops climbing at around 12 seconds after liftoff.

  <br/>
  <b>
   @Brace
  </b>
  , I think you're exaggerating the residual thrust effect at lower RPMs. Of course 70% would get you round the pattern but you're at a much lower drag config and you're going much faster, again less drag. And are improved-climb takeoffs in the 787-8 even a thing?  I can't see a two-stage rotation.

  Hello, this is my first post on pprune; as a 787 pilot I&rsquo;m also puzzled by this accident. All seem to agree that for some reason there was a complete electrical failure and RAT deployment. With a complete electrical failure all six main fuel pumps fail. Each engine also has two mechanically driven fuel pumps. On takeoff, if there is fuel in the center tank, it will be used first, pumped by the two center tank pumps.
  <br/>
  My airline&rsquo;s manuals don&rsquo;t go into much detail, but I read on another site that if both the center tank pumps fail, the engine driven pumps aren&rsquo;t able to suction feed well enough from the center tanks to sustain engine operation. If there was fuel in the center tanks, a complete electrical failure would soon lead to center tank fuel pumps failure (all fuel pumps failure as stated previously) and fuel starvation of both engines. A rescue from this situation would be an immediate selection of both center tank fuel pumps OFF (not if my airline&rsquo;s non-normal checklists) and waiting for successful suction feed from the L and R main tanks to occur, this would take a number of seconds.

  Great first post (IMMHO!) If this is correct, then I think you are onto something very significant. No expert, just an outside the box thinker who has been trying to see what ordinary (non-pilot-blaming) explanations there could be for a near simultaneous dual engine failure. I imagine a complete electrical failure leading to fuel starvation from lack of pump feed pressure from the centre tank would not result in apparently near simultaneous engine failure, but who knows? (Aren't there (suction) bypass valves here, but maybe they get stuck after long non-opening - instead long subject to closing pressures?)  This could have been the case here as my experience suggests the probabilities aren't small.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  FWIW, according to earlier posts, the fuel load was about 50T, leaving about 18T in the centre tank, so (I think) about 25-30% full. A full centre tank might allow engine pump suction to work fine, but this might not? (Contrary to what some have said.)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anyway, FWIW, not everyone agrees with RAT Deployment - see recent post by shep69. Would love to know why he doesn't go with RAT deployment...

  Sorry but that doesn't really make sense. Once the power failed and all pumps are off where is the point of switching of the center fuel pumps off? Without power they aren't running anyways.
  <br/>
  Furthermore the preference of the center tank while it's filled is just by the higher fuel pressure those center pumps deliver. There is no valve that controls that, which might be triggered by switching off pumps.

     Just for me to understand: How would you shut off the engine driven pumps if there is no electrical connection whatsoever? If there is a "powered" valve, wouldn't this (also) cut fuel suppy in case of a complete electrical failure?

   </div>
  </div>
  Wouldn't "fail safe open" imply that the valves would open on loss of control signals or power.  They don't.  They stay just where they were before loss of power or control signal.   If I understood tdracer's description of the HPSOV it can only be open or closed.  That's not true of the spar valves which are motor driven and can stop in any intermediate position if power is lost.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The only way this is relevant to the accident is if the shut off valves had been commanded closed and then power had been lost.  The valves would not open.

  I am not a Boeing pilot, but a Bus pilot. I believe that what you're describing is prevented by the certification regs for transport category airplanes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the 320 (equipped with the old system (fuel pumps), not the newer system (transfer valves)) the center tank pumps are inhibited when the airplane is airborne with the slats extended.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Check these certification rules:

     Hello, this is my first post on pprune; as a 787 pilot I\x92m also puzzled by this accident. All seem to agree that for some reason there was a complete electrical failure and RAT deployment. With a complete electrical failure all six main fuel pumps fail. Each engine also has two mechanically driven fuel pumps. On takeoff, if there is fuel in the center tank, it will be used first, pumped by the two center tank pumps.
     <br/>
     My airline\x92s manuals don\x92t go into much detail, but I read on another site that if both the center tank pumps fail, the engine driven pumps aren\x92t able to suction feed well enough from the center tanks to sustain engine operation. If there was fuel in the center tanks, a complete electrical failure would soon lead to center tank fuel pumps failure (all fuel pumps failure as stated previously) and fuel starvation of both engines. A rescue from this situation would be an immediate selection of both center tank fuel pumps OFF (not if my airline\x92s non-normal checklists) and waiting for successful suction feed from the L and R main tanks to occur, this would take a number of seconds.

  Crossky, welcome to this hamster wheel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If you go and chat to the engineers, have a look in the IPC or MM I Ch 28, you should find a good description of the fuel boost pumps. It's been a while but I recall they are Eaton designs, the general arrangement is similar to the B777. They both have a suction feed that permits fuel feed in the event of a loss of all boost pumps. The only impact of that arises at high altitude and high thrust levels, where the engine driven fuel boost pumps may capitate and reduce the available fuel feed resulting in a lower thrust level.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Refer page 12.20.02 in the TBC's B787 FCTM, or search for "SUCTION FEED".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At sea level, full thrust will be achieved without any boost pump on the aircraft. Recall that the CWT boost pumps are known as Override boost pumps, they are feeding from the CWT when there is fuel and they are running, as the output pressure is higher from these pumps than the 2 wing boost pumps. Whether there is fuel in the CWT or not, or the CWT pumps are energised, is immaterial to whether fuel will be supplied to the engine driven fuel pumps.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Note that with BA038, the fundamental problem was blockage of wax/ice formed in the piping that blocked the FOHE, and that will cause a problem with those engines that have such architecture, but is not associated with the availability of the boost pumps themselves. Even then, the engines did not technically fail, as they have both done simultaneously with the B788 of AI 171, BA's engines were running but not able to provide significant thrust due to the FOHE blockages.

  All of which has been discussed and for the wing vortices and the fuel feed has been explained quite comprehensively, along with the fuel cut offs: have you not read these posts only made recently?

  post repeats of discussions already had unless there is something of value which may change or enhance previous posts. This is a prime example of a post which should be vetted and dismissed before pressing Submit Reply 🙈

  It\x92s a possibility (as is virtually anything that doesn\x92t break the laws of physics) but all the training, practicing and checking would have been to emphasise SOPs, which are to leave all the engine controls where they are until you have done a proper interactive diagnosis at a safe height with the flightpath assured.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Where the meme has come from that jet pilots have to shut down engines as quickly as possible I don\x92t know but it is incorrect. If you left a failed engine without securing it for 5 minutes, little to no harm would come of it. Even if it was on fire (which is not necessarily flames, just higher than normal temperatures inside the nacelle) they are certified to be in this condition for some considerable time before it becomes a problem. Yes, I think the phrase \x93without undue delay\x94 could be used for a fire indication but that\x92s a minimum of 400\x92AGL in Boeings and does not absolve you of all the cross-checking and CRM that should happen with an engine shutdown. This is practiced/checked at the least every 6 months in EASA land and any attempt to rush a shutdown at low level would lead to a debrief and more training/checking.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To put it this way, control of the aeroplane and lateral/vertical navigation is far more important than doing stuff with a failed power plant. Something like an ET should be absolutely prioritised over engine drills.

     Wouldn't "fail safe open" imply that the valves would open on loss of control signals or power. They don't. They stay just where they were before loss of power or control signal. If I understood tdracer's description of the HPSOV it can only be open or closed. That's not true of the spar valves which are motor driven and can stop in any intermediate position if power is lost.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The only way this is relevant to the accident is if the shut off valves had been commanded closed and then power had been lost. The valves would not open.

  Agreed,  my brevity in reply doesn't tell the whole story.
  <br/>
  What I mean is that with engines running, fuel shut off valve(S) open, if there is a loss of electrical power the valves will remain open.
  <br/>
  This is standard design on all the gas turbine engines I have worked on.

     The gear tilt position is not definitive evidence crew had selected gear up. I've speculated another cause for this non-normal gear tilt is that C hydraulics failed around time of rotation. This would explain the gear remaining in the forward tilt position. There are reasons why the crew may have not selected gear up,

      see earlier post.
     </a>
     Therefore we cannot determine wow or air/ground logic from an assumed gear retraction.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Further to the (logical in my view) points you make in response to AAKEE's ostensibly logical conclusion that the commencement of undercarriage retraction (if it did commence) is conclusive of the aircraft being 'in the air' for aircraft systems purposes, including TCMA purposes, I make the following points:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  First, whilst it may be that every system that monitors and makes decisions about whether the aircraft is 'in the air' does so on the basis of exactly the same sensor inputs, that may not be true and I'd appreciate someone with the expert knowledge on the 78 to confirm or refute the correctness of the assumption, particularly in relation to, for example, FADEC functions compared with undercarriage control functions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Secondly and probably more importantly, what happens if one of the sensors being used to determine 'in air' versus 'on ground' gives an erroneous 'on ground' signal
  <i>
   after
  </i>
  - maybe just seconds after - every one of those sensors has given the 'in air' signal?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Reference was made earlier in this thread to a 'latched' in air FADEC condition that resulted in engine shut downs after the aircraft involved landed and was therefore actually on the ground. But what if some sensor failure had resulted in the aircraft systems believing that the aircraft was now on the ground when it was not? I also note that after the 2009 B737-800 incident at Schiphol &ndash; actually 1.5 kms away, where the aircraft crashed in a field during approach - the investigation ascertained that a RADALT system suddenly sent an erroneous minus 8&rsquo; height reading to the automatic throttle control system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The conceptual description of the TCMA says that the channels monitor the &ldquo;position of thrust lever&rdquo; &ndash; no surprises there &ndash; &ldquo;engine power level&rdquo; &ndash; no surprises there &ndash; and &ldquo;several other digital inputs via digital ARINC data buses&rdquo;.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  WoW should of course be one of those "digital inputs" and be a 1 or 0. But I haven't seen any authoritative post about whether the change in state on the 78 requires only one sensor to signal WoW or if, as is more likely, there are (at least) two sensors &ndash; one on each MLG leg &ndash; both of which have to be &lsquo;weight off&rsquo; before a weight off wheels state signal is sent. Maybe a sensor on each leg sends inputs to the ARINC data and the systems reading the data decide what to do about the different WoW signals, as between 00, 01, 10 and 11.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There is authoritative information to the effect that RADALT is also one of the &ldquo;digital inputs&rdquo; to the TCMA. The RADALTs presumably output height data (that is of course variable with height) and I don&rsquo;t know whether the RADALT hardware involved has a separate 1 or 0 output that says that, so far as the RADALT is concerned, the aircraft to which it is strapped is, in fact, &lsquo;in the air&rsquo; at &lsquo;some&rsquo; height, with the actual height being so high as to be irrelevant to the systems using that input (if that input is in fact generated and there are, in fact, systems that use that 1 or 0).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If we now consider the &lsquo;worst case scenario will be preferred&rsquo; concept that apparently applies to the TCMA design so as to achieve redundancy, the number of sensor inputs it&rsquo;s monitoring to decide whether, and can change its decision whether, the aircraft is on the ground, becomes a very important matter. The TCMA is only supposed to save the day on the ground, if the pilots select idle thrust on a rejected take off but one or both of the engines fail to respond. In the &lsquo;worst case&rsquo; (in my view) scenario, both TCMA channels on both engines will be monitoring/affected by
  <i>
   every
  </i>
  WoW sensor output and
  <i>
   every
  </i>
  RADALT output data and, if
  <i>
   any one of them
  </i>
  says &lsquo;on ground&rsquo;, that will result in
  <i>
   both
  </i>
  engines&rsquo; TCMAs being enabled to command fuel shut off, even though the aircraft may, in fact, be in the air.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Of course it&rsquo;s true that the TCMA&rsquo;s being enabled is not, of itself, sufficient to cause fuel cut off to an engine. That depends on a further glitch or failure in the system or software monitoring engine power and thrust lever position, or an actual &lsquo;too much thrust compared to thrust lever position&rsquo; situation. But I can&rsquo;t see why, on balance, it&rsquo;s prudent to increase the albeit extraordinarily remote risk of an &lsquo;in air&rsquo; TCMA commanded engine or double engine shut down due to multiple sensor failure &ndash; just one in-air / on-ground sensor and one of either the thrust lever sensor/s or engine power sensor/s &ndash; or, in the case of an actual in air &lsquo;too much thrust compared to thrust lever position situation&rsquo;, why that &lsquo;problem&rsquo; could not be handled by the crew shutting down the engine when the crew decides it&rsquo;s necessary. Once in the air, too much thrust than desired is a much better problem to have than no thrust. The latter is precisely what would happen if all &lsquo;on ground / in air&rsquo; sensors were functioning properly and some &lsquo;too much thrust&rsquo; condition occurred.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hopefully the design processes, and particularly the DO-178B/C software design processes done by people with much bigger brains than mine, have built in enough sanity checking and error checking into the system, followed by exhaustive testing, so as to render my thoughts on the subject academic.

     Hello, this is my first post on pprune; as a 787 pilot I&rsquo;m also puzzled by this accident. All seem to agree that for some reason there was a complete electrical failure and RAT deployment. With a complete electrical failure all six main fuel pumps fail. Each engine also has two mechanically driven fuel pumps. On takeoff, if there is fuel in the center tank, it will be used first, pumped by the two center tank pumps.
     <br/>
     My airline&rsquo;s manuals don&rsquo;t go into much detail, but I read on another site that if both the center tank pumps fail, the engine driven pumps aren&rsquo;t able to suction feed well enough from the center tanks to sustain engine operation. If there was fuel in the center tanks, a complete electrical failure would soon lead to center tank fuel pumps failure (all fuel pumps failure as stated previously) and fuel starvation of both engines. A rescue from this situation would be an immediate selection of both center tank fuel pumps OFF (not if my airline&rsquo;s non-normal checklists) and waiting for successful suction feed from the L and R main tanks to occur, this would take a number of seconds.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Is this something that you train for in your airline? Am I correct that to do this requires making the needed switch selections on the overhead panel?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Further up the thread one of the posters mentions that it is very unlikely that any crew action (checklist, QRH) would have got anywhere near to changing a fuel pump switch position.

  I would take that post by Crossky with a grain of salt. No part of his post made sense and I can only assume he is not a 787 pilot despite claiming to be. "Fuel starvation if pumps aren't turned off, not in my manual but I read about a procedure on the Internet", it's loony stuff.

     Is correct. As commented by Sailvi767, only after the jet is cleaned-up, away from the ground and ATC sorted out would any "normal" defect that didn't require a Memory/Recall item be attended-to. Now, if both engines stopped 7 seconds after liftoff, that's different; there is no published procedure for that.

  My understanding of the 78 fuel system is it\x92s very similar to the 777; assuming center tank fuel all pumps are turned on for takeoff (the center tank override pumps are at higher pressure than wings so it feeds first). If all electrical power is lost at lower altitudes engines suction feed just fine (probably from the wing tanks).

     If we now consider the &lsquo;worst case scenario will be preferred&rsquo; concept that apparently applies to the TCMA design so as to achieve redundancy, the number of sensor inputs it&rsquo;s monitoring to decide whether, and can change its decision whether, the aircraft is on the ground, becomes a very important matter. The TCMA is only supposed to save the day on the ground, if the pilots select idle thrust on a rejected take off but one or both of the engines fail to respond. In the &lsquo;worst case&rsquo; (in my view) scenario, both TCMA channels on both engines will be monitoring/affected by
     <i>
      every
     </i>
     WoW sensor output and
     <i>
      every
     </i>
     RADALT output data and, if
     <i>
      any one of them
     </i>
     says &lsquo;on ground&rsquo;, that will result in
     <i>
      both
     </i>
     engines&rsquo; TCMAs being enabled to command fuel shut off, even though the aircraft may, in fact, be in the air.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I don't think &lsquo;worst case scenario will be preferred&rsquo; is the philosophy they use. The way tdracer explained it, there can't be any single failure that leads to uncommanded high thrust on the ground. Presumably, each FADEC channel is treated as a single 'fault isolation area.' That's why the inactive channel has to be able to effect a shutdown in case the active channel causes a runaway.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the sake of argument, imagine if
  <i>
   every
  </i>
  air/ground sensor had to say 'ground' to enable TCMA. That should still meet the 'no single failure' requirement since you'd need at least 2 failures to get a runaway engine: the original thrust control problem, and a faulty air/ground sensor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  IIRC, he said that the 747-8 looks at weight on wheels, gear truck tilt, and radio altimeters. At least one of each has to say 'ground' for TCMA to be enabled.

  Perceived wisdom may be applicable in normal circumstances but not when all the holes line up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For example I've seen it quoted many times that the engine FADECs are self powered
  <br/>
  by the engines, the TCMAs-whether part of the FADEC or a separate unit, similarly self contained
  <br/>
  within the engine. The perceived wisdom seems to be that there is no common single fault
  <br/>
  which can take out both engines.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And yet we're also told that the TCMA function can only function in ground mode and receives ground-air
  <br/>
  signals from a combination of inputs from Rad Alts and WOW sensors.
  <br/>
  There is therefore a connection from the central EE bay to the engine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yes I'm sure the Rad/Alt and WOW sensor processing will use different sensors for each side and powered from different
  <br/>
  low voltage buses.
  <br/>
  However as an analogy, in your house your toaster in the kitchen may be on a separate circuit from the water heater in
  <br/>
  the bathroom, each protected by a fuse at the main switchboard. In normal operation a fault in one cannot affect the other.
  <br/>
  However a lightning strike outside the house can send much higher voltages than normal operation throughout the entire
  <br/>
  system and trash every electrical appliance not physically disconnected at the time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Now I'm not suggesting the aircraft was hit by lightning but FDR has proposed a single event, buildup from a water leak entering
  <br/>
  one of the EE bays at rotate. It would be possible for one or more of the HV electrical buses to short so that all the low voltage
  <br/>
  buses go high voltage. I have no knowledge of how the FADEC / TCMA systems connect to or process the Ground-Air signals but
  <br/>
  there is a single fault mechanism whereby high voltage could be simultaneously and inappropriately applied to both engine control systems.
  <br/>
  It would be unfortunate if this failure mechanism did cause power to be applied to drive the fuel shut off valve closed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since the likelihood is that we're looking at a low probability event then perceived wisdom about normal operations and fault modes
  <br/>
  might not be applicable.

  )
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 787 battery fire report says the two recorders are on the left and right 28VDC buses. I don't think those get powered on RAT by the looks of it. I would wager you get whatever is on the 235VAC 'backup bus', plus the captain's and F/O's instrument buses via C1/C2 TRUs. You won't get all of that (like the F/O's screens) because the 787 energises/de-energises specific bits of equipment, not just whole buses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Losing recorder power looks entirely expected.

  400VAC/540VDC (+-270V) is not really known for blowing past input protection in the same way as actual HV or lightning. I would expect some optocouplers and/or transformers to be both present and adequate. There's definitely some big MOVs scattered around the main 235VAC buses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Weight on wheels appears to go into data concentrators that go into the common core system (i.e. data network).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Presumably there is a set of comms buses between the FADECs and the CCS to allow all the pretty indicators and EICAS alerts in the cockpit to work. The WoW sensors might flow back via that, or via dedicated digital inputs from whatever the reverse of a data concentrator is called (surely they have need for field actuators other than big motors?). Either way, left and right engine data should come from completely different computers, that are in the fwd e/e bay (or concentrators/repeaters in the wings, maybe) rather than in with the big power stuff in the aft e/e bay.
