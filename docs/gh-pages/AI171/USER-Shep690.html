     We're all shouting each other down with two main different theories on why the aircraft lost lift so shortly after takeoff.
     <br>
      <br>
       1) Incorrect flap retraction causing the aircraft to lose lift and unable to recover the energy in time. (Not unheard of and plenty of reports where this has happened - albeit usually not to a crash).
       <br>
        <br>
         2) Loss of engine thrust backed up two potential pieces of evidence that back up the RAT was deployed (apparent RAT sound, potential RAT seen on low res video).
         <br>
          <br>
           It is impossible to know which of these is the case. Considering this summary of memory items is there the potential for a combination of both theories to have taken place?
           <br>
            <br/>
            Inadvertant flap retraction by PNF leading the PF to sense a sink and loss of lift. Pushes the thrust levers forward to the firewall and still the aircraft sinks. PF looking through the HUD and so very much 'outside focused' and doesn't realise that PNF has instead moved the flaps. PF defaults to memory items for loss of thrust on both engines before PNF can realise or communicate to PF what they've done, start switches are cut off which drops the RAT and from that point they're only heading one way. This would satisfy the strongly held belief that the RAT was extended, whilst also following the more likely initial cause of an action slip by PNF starting the sequence, rather than a dual engine failure.
           </br>
          </br>
         </br>
        </br>
       </br>
      </br>
     </br>
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  This to me makes more sense; perhaps I`ve got it wrong but in the video the trailing edge flaps definitely look up. Maybe there`s more and they weren`t.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On a flap 5 takeoff the FMS could be programmed to select climb power at flaps 1 which would seem like an apparent loss of thrust. Same as for F15 to F5 or further.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I`m not sure if they would have cycled the FCS switches or not. But the airplane certainly would have experienced a loss of lift would the flaps been inadvertently retracted.  As well as perceived loss of thrust.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  OTOH any castastophic failure which left the gear down would have essentially left the flaps where they were. They are hydraulically activated with electrical backup but it`s wayyyyy slow.

     Even my very experienced planespotter friends agree with me that it'd be very hard to notice from the ground even with bino's, let alone grainy footage. The B787/788's flaps are so well integrated you can hardly spot the difference if you're not sitting right next to them already.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Now I'm curious of the mechanical switchover mechanism that prevents backtracking of the flaps in the event the hydraulics fail and pressure drops which would slowly retract the flaps as hydraulic fluid drains from the pressure reservoir.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  They`re on jackscrews so they won`t move in the event of hydraulic failure (at least initially).  There`s a backup electrical motor which can be used to position flaps but it operates much more slowly than they hydraulic motor.

     Climb Power is programmed as an altitude in the FMC, usually 1000' but sometimes higher for noise abatement, which in this case they wouldn't have reached.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     In some instances, the TO derate is so significant that the selection of climb power moves the thrust levers forward. AMD is sea level with a long runway, so can imagine it would be a fairly low power take off.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Flew the 777 assuming the FMS is similar. We would usually program the FMS to select climb power based on flap setting (F5 for a F15/20 TO; flaps 1 for a F5 takeoff). It could also be set to an altitude but our SOP was normally flap setting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And yes with a takeoff with heavy derates CLB might be more than selected for TO (although IIRC CLB2 usually wasn`t when we were using TO2 with moderate AT).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Understand it`s a long runway but I wouldn&rsquo;t assume heavy derates with a moderately long flight and full airplane (and hot day). But we don`t know yet.

     I\x92m now convinced the whole \x91mis-selected flaps\x92 is a complete red herring. Based on the wreckage on the ground which clearly showed the flaps extended and a still from the witness video which I am 100% sure shows the flaps extended. I always believed it was a total loss of thrust and now can\x92t see any other explanation and so need to know why that happened.

  But if the TE flaps were down in TO position in the wreckage pic (haven`t seen it) that`s that.

     Imaginations are running wild for some people here. Major electrical fault that leads to double engine failure at v2? Really? If that were the case the 787 fleet would be grounded by now given the black box has almost certainly been examined.

  Agreed.  These possibilities are so infinitely small that it seems folks are dwelling on minutia.  Interesting minutia but of such low probability.
  <br>
   <br>
    We`ll just have to wait a bit until some facts come out.

    Not ready to shelve the flap/RTOW probability quite yet.

    Or even deliberate (or inadvertent) actuation of the FCSs.  Incapication, etc.

  So for those getting in the weeds with one in several trillion (or lower) probabilities of systems failures have you considered that that improper RTOW (with or without improper flap setting), flap retraction / climb thrust trigger, is of much higher probability and has actually happened ?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anyway I think we&rsquo;ll find out soon if a systems failure was involved.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The FLCH Hold thing (Asiana) was never an issue and well known (at least on our line). And for a crew of 3 (or 4) to press a destabilized approach getting 40-ish knots too slow (!) isn&rsquo;t a systems problem &mdash; it&rsquo;s a breach of basic airmanship.

     Have you considered that what you have described won\x92t deploy the rat, initiate the gear retraction sequence or cause the auto start of the APU, all of which there is a fair bit of compelling evidence for?

  Not sure we have definitive evidence of that at this point. Now cycling the engines through the FCSs or either deliberate or inadvertent movement of those to off would cause that but we\x92re still deep in we don\x92t know land.
  <br>
   <br>
    I do concur if it was a major systems breakdown without crew mistakes being made we will know shortly through emergency ADs.

  While I disagree with the arrogance of the post generating the conflagration (and the \x91here\x92s how it went down\x92) if one rephrases and softens up the language a bit (and considering how many other low probability scenarios have been posted) the point has some validity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In jet aircraft how many systems related dual engine flameouts have occurred at low altitude ? Excluding FOD \x97 birds and ice (which presumably aren\x92t a factor here) how many systems caused dual engine flameouts have occurred ?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As opposed to how many engine failures, thrust losses, or shutdowns have been caused by crew members grabbing at improper levers under stress or setting wrong data (I\x92ll include Air Florida in that).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Not meant to be self - indicting by any means but if one is looking at probabilities and far-fetched scenarios you can\x92t exclude crew actions as a part of that.

While there are multiple examples of air disasters caused solely by astonishingly egregious malfeasance by pilots, I see absolutely no point in unsupported speculation about such things. I can't ever say "no professional aircrew would ever do that" but spouting off random theories with no evidence and no practical experience or knowledge of the actual operations involved is really annoying and pointless. If you are a GA pilot, SLF with an engineering degree or a sim enthusiast then maybe, just maybe, you can manage to ask an intelligent question--preferrably one that hasn't already been asked and answered five times already. But please keep your inane hypotheses and conclusions to yourself for now.

  There\x92s been unsupported speculation about everything else up to this point. Which involves professional aspects of engineering design, maintainers, fuelers, etc. While it was phrased poorly ignoring operational factors isn\x92t right either.

  Short answer is yes but IIRC from the 777 (believe the 78 to be similar) the auto throttles go into SPD mode at that point which could be really confusing. As one goes up through the MCP altitude and the FD commands a descent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In any case the autopilot wouldn\x92t have been in at such a low altitude and the PF would have been hand flying. Most of the min engagement altitudes for autopilots is 400\x92 AGL.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But again all of this is speculation in every way.

  One good thing from reading the full thread is I learned the 78 hydraulic system is essentially the same as the 777 !
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While I appreciate the excellent analysis of some regarding the RAT I`m still not completely convinced of its deployment much less why it depoloyed.  Sounds like the auto-deploy is identical to 777 (less the transfer bus deal which is replaced by the electrics on the 78 system), but it can be manually deployed as well by boinking the button.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I very much respect the survivors testimony.  It will be very helpful.  And all he went through.  However, one must realize that under stress and injury (whether pilot or pax) ones memory is severely affected by physiological factors and retrograde symptoms of a traumatic event which varies by individual.

     I wouldn't be surprised.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The speed should be at least at V2 and probably higher. Why would the ATS not just hold that speed, albeit being a shock to the crew. Within a few seconds I'll bet the throttles would end up back in the forward position as the ATS says "hey, we're slowing down fast here!". It would be ugly but I can't see that the jet's going to drop out of the sky. The throttles aren't going to come right back and stay right back.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Because they are in `hold` after the takeoff thrust is set by engaging the TOGA levers. VNAV will engage at 400` AGL and set them at THR REF &mdash; referencing takeoff or climb thrust as programmed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From one of the previous scenarios if capture at a way low altitude occurred they`d (IIRC correctly) engage in SPD mode resulting in a significant loss of thrust as they attempted to maintain speed assuming a level off. Presumably after this when the PF continued a climb (regardless of flight director) they`d come forward after this loss of thrust to attempt to meet commanded speed&mdash;V2 or V2+15 or whatever&mdash;but there`d be a lag. But I`ve never misset the MCP to a way low altitude in flight or the sim (not a holier than thou thing) so I`m not entirely sure how how the autothrottles would behave.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than one crew has failed to push them to the stops when things went south.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And the reverse is true; when the second MCAS accident happened IIRC the autothrottles stayed in THR REF due to task saturation by the crew. Exacerbating the condition and ultimately resulting in an accident.

     My comment was in relation to the scenario being discussed: a low-level level-off because the altitude selector was set properly before takeoff. And in any case, that Air India jet didn't look like it had climb thrust on as it topped out and started descending; it was pretty much gliding.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  If the MCP were set incorrectly I`m thinking that the initial response of the autothrottles would be to reduce thrust based on the anticipated level off to maintain bug speed. Which might be a huge decrease in thrust. Not sure if that would engage below 400 agl because i`ve never tried it. I`d expect the autothrottles to push the power back up if the pilot (rightly) looked through the flight director and continued the climb regardless, but I think there might be an initial loss of significant thrust until the autothrottles figured it out.
  <br>
   <br>
    Never tried it so I`m not sure.

     I don't have access to a current 787 manual, but have found a couple of unverified references to the VNAV engagement on the net. It appears the VNAV will engage at 400ft also. Happy to be corrected though.

  Hmmmmm\x85.then I wonder how the auto throttles will behave if a low stop height if the MCP is mis set \x97 potentially below 400\x92 AGL. Will they stay in hold, will they go to SPD, or will they engage in THR REF.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I never tried this in the sim on the 777 so I\x92m not sure. I was grateful that the 777 would change to SPD mode on initial altitude capture (as opposed to the -400 VMo here we go). It\x92s been a few years in any case though.

     Usually on takeoff LNAV and VNAV are armed. During the takeoff roll the autothrottle system goes in to HOLD mode at 80kts.
     <br>
      <br>
       At that point the FMAs read:

       <br/>
       <br/>
       At 50' LNAV engages and the FMAs change to:

       <br/>
       <br/>
       At 400' VNAV engages and the FMAs change to:
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <img alt="" class="post_inline_image" src="https://cimg9.ibsrv.net/gimg/pprune.org-vbulletin/1127x198/fma_3_63ec72bdaf3a567a7e82227d3e7f091fc87c6600.jpg"/>
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The height is referenced to a barometric snapshot taken during the take off roll at 100kts.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       If an altitude is captured before VNAV engagement (totally bizarre to capture an altitude of less than 400') then the FMAs would change to:
       <br/>
       <br/>
       SPD | LNAV | ALT
      </br>
     </br>
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Thanks much &mdash; pretty much same as 777. Was wondering if someone had set MCP to 200 in error what autothrottles would do. What I&rsquo;m wondering is if the aircraft were being hand flown to a low capture like that if the autothrottles would initially pull power back from THR REF to anticipated level off setting for SPD which would be bug speed (V2 to V2+15). And might be a fairly dramatic reduction of power. Granted since its speed on autothrottles at some point power should come back up. But I wonder if the autothrottles would respond to what they thought for level flight initially.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Could explain the witnesses thought that power came back up before they hit but witness recollections post traumatic event as well as second hand reporting need some time to settle in before accurate facts come out.

     Non-aviation engineer here: I have a question about the low level altitude capture theory that I've been a bit hesitant to ask, since no-one else seemed to be bringing it up.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     My understanding of altitude capture is that the autopilot will automatically adjust
     <i>
      both
     </i>
     thrust
     <i>
      and pitch
     </i>
     to intercept the requested altitude. However to my eyes there is very little pitch adjustment in the CCTV video of the plane taken from behind, until the very end of the video when it pitches up somewhat (obscured by buildings, more visible in the smartphone video). Please correct me if I'm wrong but I'd have thought that if the autopilot was trying to capture a very low altitude it would start pitching down (quite noticeably!) to do so, not remain at what looks like 10+ degrees nose-up. I honestly struggle to reconcile what I'm looking at in the video with an attempt to level off at 0ft, 200ft, or any of the other mentioned low-level altitudes.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Also maybe I'm missing something 787-specific but generally doesn't the autopilot have to be activated for the aircraft to automatically attempt to capture the pre-selected altitude? That was the case in this incident involving a Dash 8 and a target altitude of 0 feet that I am reading about (
     <a href="https://www.gov.uk/aaib-reports/aaib-investigation-to-dhc-8-402-dash-8-g-ecoe" target="_blank">
      https://www.gov.uk/aaib-reports/aaib...-dash-8-g-ecoe
     </a>
     ). I'd have thought the PF would still be hand-flying the departure at the point that things went wrong, considering that the gear hadn't even been retracted yet...
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  The autopilot would not have been in and the pilot would have been hand flying maintaining the takeoff attitude. The flight director might have commanded a level off which obviously would not have been followed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Minimum autopilot engagement altitude is 200\x92 for the 78 (from others on the forum). It\x92s 400\x92 AGL on the 777.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  My interest is in how the auto throttles would have behaved in such a situation\x97where VNAV would not be engaged yet and the automatics gone into SPD/ALT. ; would they have pulled off thrust assuming a level off and then come back in to maintain bug speed (perhaps confusing the crew in the process ?).

    One fact that alters things substantially is whether the survivor's impression is correct that possibly the engines started to spool up again just before impact. If that's the case then what does that do to the possibility or otherwise that the TMCA system caused a dual engine shutdown?
   </div>
  </div>
  That&rsquo;s what got me headed down the low altitude capture route. While the mind does really strange things post traumatic event &mdash; and memory and recollection are greatly affected by it &mdash; if true it means that thrust was lost but the engines stayed lit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There may have been other electrical and systems malfunctioning. But if whatever happened, let&rsquo;s say the auto throttle simply pulled power to idle &mdash;or a low power setting&mdash;at a critical time. Perhaps on its own perhaps with other systems failures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  We like to think it basic that we&rsquo;d slam the throttles forward. Right away.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Asiana didn&rsquo;t.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And neither did Air Florida years ago.

     Best glide doesn't start until the aircraft reaches best glide speed. That might mean raising the nose to decelerate depending on the starting speed. Not saying this case was far above best gliding speed, but your statement assumes they were below best gliding speed.
    </div>

  Without thrust (however it happened) in a large airplane like a 787 at a few hundred feet at 15 degrees nose up or so you&rsquo;re not going to have a lot of time to attain much of anything. You might be able to reduce G loading to prevent a stall and keep the wing flying but that`s about it.
