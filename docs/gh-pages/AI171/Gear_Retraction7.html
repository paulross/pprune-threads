  The 787-8 landing gear retraction is primarily hydraulic, using the center hydraulic system for the main operation. However, the alternate gear
  <i>
   <u>
    extension
   </u>
  </i>
  system utilizes a dedicated electric pump to pressurize fluid from the center hydraulic system for gear extension. Obviously due its size and weight and staged retraction, the effort required to raise and stow the gear greatly exceeds that required for extension.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The main gear retraction/extension is controlled by the center hydraulic system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is apparent that the hydraulics failed when the engines shut down after breaking the down-locks and leaving the Main Landing gear bogeys in the tilt position, ready for a
  <b>
   <i>
    next step
   </i>
  </b>
  internal stowage and door closure (that was now never to happen). It is therefore apparent that the dual engine failure and consequent automated RAT extension was precipitated by this gear selection or retraction cycle and thus likely to be either WoW micro-switch or 5G Radar altimeter-effect associated. Due to accumulator depletion, the electric pump load would have spiked to replenish it. This may have precipitated the dual engine shutdown due to an unfiltered electrical surge affecting the Ground/Air microswitches (or a local 5G transmission affecting the RADALT) and resetting the TCMA.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The RADALT? Another plausibility? Because of the furore over a spasticated frequency allocation by the US FCC, the US FAA had finally &ldquo;bought in&rdquo; and declared that individual nations and their airline operators were responsible for their own 5G frequency spectrum allocations and for taking essential steps to ensure mitigation of the interference effects upon aircraft automated landings and other
  <i>
   critical systems
  </i>
  caused by their own national approved 5G spectrum decisions. It was admittedly a situation calling for extensive modifications to (and shielding for) the three radar altimeters fitted for redundancy considerations to all modern airliners... for Category 3 ILS approach and landing in zero/zero visibility conditions.  The RADALT also features in many air-ground sensing applications. (eg the 747-8).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This was an unusual FAA
  <i>
   &ldquo;passing of the buck&rdquo;
  </i>
  to manufacturers such as Honeywell etc. (to sort out with client operators). But then again, it was not the US FCC&rsquo;s right to dictate the specific 5G frequencies internationally. These spectrum allocations now vary over the wide selection of 5G phones available (and also nationally). 5G Radar Altimeters constitute a part of the ground/Air sensing that changes the TCMA from ground mode (able to fuel-chop engines) to the air mode (inhibited from doing so)... Ground activation is acceptable ...where fuel chopping of uncommanded thrust can prevent runway sideways excursions or runway length overruns. The question now becomes: &ldquo;Is it more (or less) safe having an automated fuel-chopping capability on BOTH your left and right, rather than leaving it to the pilot to react via his center console fuel cut-off switches... in the unlikely event of a runaway engine after landing (or during an abandoned take-off)?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <b>
   5G Frequency Variations
  </b>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The frequencies of 5G phones vary nationally based on the frequency bands allocated and used by different carriers in each country. In the United States, for example, carriers such as AT&amp;T, Verizon, T-Mobile, and others use a combination of low-band, mid-band, and high-band 5G frequencies.
  <b>
   Low-band 5G frequencies typically range from 600 MHz to 1 GHz, mid-band 5G frequencies range from 1.7 GHz to 2.5 GHz, and high-band 5G (mmWave) frequencies start at 24 GHz and go up to 40 GHz
  </b>
  . These frequencies are allocated by regulatory bodies such as the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and can vary between countries based on spectrum availability and regulatory decisions. In other countries, the specific frequency bands used for 5G may differ, leading to variations in the frequencies supported by 5G phones. Additionally, the deployment of 5G networks can also influence the frequencies used, with some countries focusing more on sub-6 GHz bands while others prioritize mmWave technology.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  5G interference? It may be an avenue worth exploring?

   The seat back story
  </strong>
 </div>
 <hr/>

 <div id="post_message_11905688">
  @ferry pilot and others who mentioned the seat back collapsing: That was from an entirely unrelated incident on Air India Express flight 611 in 2018 which got poorly rehashed / fakenewsed into a bogus theory over the last week. It was a 737. It did *not* happen on AI171.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For what it's worth, the AIX 611 story in 2018 involved a 737 captain's seat back being overtightened and suddenly collapsing backwards during the takeoff roll. He had been guarding the thrust levers and reflexively grabbed them when falling back, causing a thrust reduction from 98% N1 to 75% N1 or thereabouts. Control was immediately transferred to the other pilot but the inadvertent thrust change was not corrected immediately, and the plane took off a few seconds later with a tail strike, scraping the runway, flying through the localizer and demolishing part of the airport perimeter wall with its landing gear. During the climb, the flight crew ran several system checks and landing gear tests to reassure themselves the plane was fine, then proceeded with the flight, pressurizing the aircraft and whatnot. They evidently did not consult the tail strike procedure. Many hours later they were ordered by company to divert and land quickly after the damage was seen at the airport. After landing, the plane was found to have a fair bit of damage, including part of the perimeter wall's barbed wire fencing material wrapped around the landing gear. But zero injuries, and the plane was fixed and flew again.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's an entertaining story because of the cause and the happy ending, but had nothing to do with AI171, for which we all await the preliminary report.

     Early during the 787 flight testing phase (9 Nov 2010) before the battery fire escapades, there was an electrical fire aboard aircraft ZA002 that had potential for serious consequences.
     <br/>
     From memory, the 787 electrical distribution does not involve electro-mechanical contactors but instead uses solid state devices that are controlled by software.
     <br/>
     The Air India accident aircraft was experiencing electrical problems in the cabin on the prior flight according to passenger reports.
     <br/>
     Were these problems addressed or where they non-MEL items?
     <br/>
     The accident aircraft seems to have experienced a significant electrical event coincident with transition from Ground to Air mode (which I would expect results in some software reconfiguration of the aircraft electrical system).
     <br/>
     If the ground to air transition momentarily activated a grounded electrical system, then there could be a rather large plasma cloud of vaporized metal surrounding adjacent wires which could send electrical power to places it would not normally go.
     <br/>
     Swiss Cheese model anyone?

  Very interesting. Pal of mine used to fly. Caught up with him last night over text. This is what he said:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  \x93An aircraft can be in service for many years before supposedly 'random' failures are discovered. We had a 747-400 departing JNB many years ago, and during the take off roll, the inboard leading edge flaps (flaps on the Jumbo, not slats) retracted. The only indication of this was the flaps secondary display popping up and crosses appearing over the inboard LE flaps. No Master Caution, no warnings of any kind. Apparently the system was working exactly as 'designed\x92!
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During the landing roll, when Reverse is selected, the inboard LE flaps automatically retract, to avoid damage from any debris blown up by the effect of the reverse thrust.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In this take off scenario, due to maintenance work being carried out earlier in the day, the aircraft thought the reversers had been selected, and 'correctly' retracted the flaps. At rotation, the stick shaker activated, and the aircraft struggled to get airborne. The passengers got lucky, as the First Officer, who was Pilot Handling, was an experienced aerobatic pilot, and was able to keep the aircraft airborne, flying in heavy buffet and with the stick shaker activated until the air-ground logic finally caught up after gear retraction, and the LE flaps deployed again.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Not something that most regular guys would cope with, particularly at night, with no outside horizon for reference. Pilots who\x92ve operated around Africa will know what I'm talking about.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They dumped fuel and returned to JNB.
  <br/>
  This happened on May 11th 2009 (Google it) - just how long had the Jumbo, of all variants, been in service before this 'glitch' was discovered?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The actual issue was that during the earlier maintenance, the engineers had cycled the thrust levers, with the engines off, all the way through the reverse gates, and back again (the aircraft had arrived earlier that day, and a reverser had failed to deploy). What no one knew, was that the action of moving the thrust levers through the reverse gate, would latch a bit of software logic in one of the computers on board, causing a near catastrophic sequence of events.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  We all know and love the Jim Reason Swiss cheese model - I suspect we're going to discover some previously unknown holes.\x94
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I find it rather a coincidence that this aircraft had so many electrical problems, had, not been retrofitted to solve one electrical issues like all 787s in the US had, and suffered what appears to be some kind of electrical failure.

  Presumably the RAT was deployed (with an "humungous" bang) when the residual pressure in the "C" hydraulic system decayed to zero: there was initially enough to tilt the trucks but thats it.

  In a video of a 787 gear swing on jacks the trucks start moving to the nose down tilt position at the same time as the door starts to open so if the door did not open it is unlikely the gear was selected up and the truck tilt was more likely a result of C system failure. The front end of the truck is the heavier end because of the truck position actuator location so along with air loads, a nose down position is the result.

 <div id="post_message_11905939">
  Does a Boeing 787 go from HOLD TO/GA to THR REF/VNAV SPD at 400' AGL/AAE, like older versions of the Boeing?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If so, what if the WoW stayed in ground mode, for whatever reason, how would that affect
  <br/>
  <br/>
  1) Retraction of the landing gear (it didn't retract, as obvious in videos released)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  2) The transition from HOLD to THR/REF at 400' (they reached just barely over 400' AGL before leveling, then descending)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I am also thinking that Air India would follow Boeing procedures in that the left seat pilot will move their right hand away from the thrust levers at V1, and thus, at 400', the thrust levers are not guarded or monitored?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Even if thrust levers were pushed forward, is there some kind of logic related to FMC and-or FADEC or other involved systems, which regardless of thrust lever position commands IDLE thrust to the engine?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Remember that Airbus accident where the aircraft thought it was landing, while the pilots wanted full thrust, and they crashed into a small forest because some kind of idle is all they were afforded by the system?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If the engines of this 787 thought it was in the rollout or final part of the flare, it might also command thrust levers to idle?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This does not explain the RAT, though, unless there is some weird combination of software working against each others logic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <span style="color:#000000">
   Had the engines failed by some really random, odd reason, like birds, fuel contamination-vapor-starvation or such, wouldn't there be at least a slight bit of roll or yaw visible? Even with TAC or whatever they have on the 787, I would think even a 1 second difference in thrust reduction between the engines, a hint of yaw or roll should be visible ...

  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thoughts, especially by someone who flies the 787?

     Here we go again.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     They are not "ground-only" levers, Why do you and MagPlug have this idea that the PF would not place their hand back on the thrust levers after the gear up call, or at least be guarding the throttles just in case, heaven forbid, they started to roll back?
     <br/>
     ...
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I agree to placing hands on, or behind to guard them, during many phases of flight. But when do your hands go back on the thrust levers after take-off, before 400' AGL? Would that be the left seat pilot, the PF or PM doing that?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is noteworthy that the point that thrust is lost, is very close to 400' AGL, where at least on some other Boeing aircraft, HOLD changes to THR REF. It seems coincident with this height, the thrust is lost. And lost so closely, between the engines, that there seems to be neither yaw nor roll to see in the videos. Does the 787 have a system for asymmetric thrust, like the TAC on the 777? Even if it does, would the aircraft still not show at least a slight bit of yaw/roll before such a system kicked in, unless both engines lost thrust near simultaneously?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If all AC and DC was lost in an instant, then that would be within a split second for both engines, via the FSOVs, rendering FADEC powerless. If anything like birds, bad fuel, lack of fuel, vapour or all other things like that mentioned, the chances of no yaw seem only remotely possible.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Then there is the RAT and the landing gear.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Any indication from known videos as to what height the RAT comes on, around 400' AGL, or well before reaching 400' ?

  What for? It could possibly reveal some abstract relationship flaw between microswitches, RadAlts, and/or even shock-strut extension or travelling gear or door position that allows for an effect dependent upon the high ambient temperature-dictated interrelationship?
  <br/>
  Why ferret thusly? Many latent gremlins reside in complex circuitry. It is very hard to get away from the logical proposition that gear selection / travel (or possibly the earlier G/A transition) predicated the double flame-out and RAT deployment. The 787 was always ever described as an electric airplane and I see that as a harbinger - not of doom, but of inspiration.
  <br/>
  I personally have never trusted electro-mechanical devices such as micro-switches... or for that matter, solenoid-operated relays. Or travelling further afield, those fiendish devices called circuit-breakers (thermal or otherwise). And a description of an RCD as a "safety switch" sends a shiver up my spine. They are really just a potential annoyance and an ongoing expense. As I have found again and again, their reliability and test functions are no guarantee of serviceability. A ceiling fire cured me of that fantasy.
  <br/>
  <b>
   <i>
    You might also reflect deeply upon the following observation:
   </i>
  </b>
  <br/>
  From the outset, this electric airplane had electrical issues. The Lithium Ion battery fires were never really resolved. They just re-housed it in a very stout titanium box - one that can only breathe a fiery breath overboard I believe... as if it was a slice of thorium always threatening to turn into lethal plutonium. The 787 designers convinced the regulator that their electric airplane could only become an industry steed if it had the power of such a battery. Unsure whether there's since been any ongoing issues (or if there had been, would it become a "known" event - now that this malignant potency has been robustly "contained"?). So what happens when a fire breaks out inside that titanium box and all its volts are discharged overboard? Are any battery-powered holding relays released at that point? i.e. is there a damning catch? Pandora's stout box may prove to be a gift-horse.

  I hope/wish. I accept that it's not at all likely that TCMA is the/a culprit in this crash, but it is, like the cutoff switches, one of the few things
  <i>
   designed and intended

  to shut down an engine in a very big hurry. It would be good to know as much as possible about how it determines the aircraft's ground/air state.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And add the radio altimeter(s). I think, but don't know, that they provide inputs to the FADEC TCMA function also.

     Except that the PF does not immediately get the cue that the power is backing off, because he removed his hand from the power levers at V1. If he sees the Flight Directors indicating down after take off.... of course he will ignore that command and maintain the normal 14deg NU +/- for the expected all-engines climb. However when the speed starts to decay he starts to get the message all is not well and tries to salvage the situation. If the FD goes into altitude capture then the autothrottle becomes speed-on-throttle. Unfortunately the AT logic presumes you are following the FD. If you are now NOT following FD commands then the results become unpredictable. On correct speed but above FCU selected altitude = throttles close.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Just after rotate is a very busy time for your scan. The FMA modes are in the HUD for both pilots to see, however did they have time to read and digest rapidly changing autoflight modes? I have way more experience flying the B744 than the B788 but I can see this happening on either type. How many times were you reminded to RTF FMA!
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  SLF but: I still really don't understand how this is supposed to happen, not merely hypothetically, but congruently with how short and low the flight we can actually see is.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  My understanding (and others have corroborated this) is that in a standard departure the autothrottle is armed and starts the takeoff roll in THR REF mode. It goes into HOLD mode when the IAS passes 80 knots (obviously still on the ground). While it is in HOLD mode, the autothrottle is physically inhibited from moving the thrust levers. It then automatically re-engages at 400ft AGL (though I am not sure how the altitude is measured), and begins to operate as requested by various human and computer systems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If something about my explanation is wrong, please let me know - but if it is correct, then
  <i>
   how
  </i>
  would the autothrottle roll back thrust drastically in what looks like the first few seconds of the flight? I do understand that what you describe is how the autothrottle would behave when it is active, but it sounds to me like it is by design
  <i>
   not
  </i>
  supposed to actually be active during the critical time that we are looking at no matter what automations are armed to be activated once the aircraft is safely away from the ground. Unless the crew did
  <i>
   something
  </i>
  to cause it to engage - and I'm not sure what that would even be. What would they plausibly be doing before even retracting the landing gear?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  My only guess was that depending on how the altitude is measured to determine whether the 400ft gate has been passed (radio altimeter? pressure altitude?), the autothrottle might have come out of HOLD mode (along with VNAV if armed) at a lower altitude than it was supposed to due to some mechanical fault or crew error. But that's already a bigger kettle of fish than just altitude capture...

     ... So if the electrics and the pumps went offline and the fuel vapor pressure was way too high, I suppose there could be vapors formed in the suction line going to the mechanical pumps. But I don't have nearly enough knowledge to proclaim that as a possibility. ...

  It sounds like loss of all electric fuel pumps could potentially cause a temporary loss of performance - not a complete engine failure and perhaps not even a long-lived loss of thrust, but something that could impact 1 or both engines if the conditions are the same on both sides.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  How much loss of thrust can be tolerated in the first 30 seconds of flight, with the landing gear down and in high temperature?

  What I cannot do is add new theories or uncover any new facts the actual experts have not already thought of. However, since summarizing and structuring information is one thing lawyers tend to regularly do (and sometimes even do well), here is my attempt at a useful contribution to this thread: an attempt to summarize the main theories discussed here since day one (which I think hasn't been done for quite some time) in the hope that a birds-eye view will be helpful to those who have not read everything since the beginning or might even trigger some new flash of inspiration for someone more knowledgable than me. I have focused on the cons since there does not seem to be enough evidence to come to any positive conclusion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I shall try to be concise and to refrain from personal evaluations of my own. Of course, no disrespect whatsoever is intended towards all those who have contributed to this thread and to the individual theories, one or combinations of which may turn out to have led to this tragic outcome. That arguments can be made against every single theory that has been propagated seems to be the result of the highly improbable and unusual nature of this deplorable event and certainly not due to any lack of knowledge or reasoning skills in this forum.

   For a while, the forward tilt of the bogies as first part of the retraction cycle was seen as additional evidence that the gear had been selected up.

It is now assumed the forward tilt of the bogies was merely a consequence of the hydraulic power loss.

  Engineer not a pilot. Experience in analog front ends, A2D and R2D conversion and embedded systems generally but no specific knowledge of the 787 or GEnx.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I like everyone else have no evidence that TMCA played a role but given that it is one of the few systems with the ability to cut fuel to the engines, here are some thoughts on how signal processing could have extended the window of when TMCA could bite. In particular, I'm looking at the time immediately after the nose lifts up when something may have physically shifted onboard.
  <br/>
  I'll phrase it as a number of questions but realise that the few people who can answer may not be able to for now.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thanks to tdracer's explanation on TMCA (albeit 747 not 787), we know that TMCA is a logic block within the FADEC whose only external inputs are a logic signal fron the aircraft that indicates whether it is on the ground or not and throttle position as determined by two independent resolvers per throttle side.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The logic would seem to be something of the form
  <br/>
  If (G AND (N2&gt;A OR N2&gt;B)) Then CutOffFuel()
  <br/>
  where G is true when the aircraft is on the ground,
  <br/>
  A is an envelope defined by throttle resolver channel A and
  <br/>
  B is an envelope defined by throttle resolver channel B
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Q1: Am I correct in that assumption that when on the ground, overspeed with respect to EITHER resolver A OR resolver B can trigger TMCA?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  We have been told that the logic (ie true or false) signal G is determined from the Weight-on-wheels sensors and the RadALT. It is reasonable to suppose that the designers still wanted TMCA to function after a hard landing where some landing gear components had failed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Q2: When the nosewheel lifts off but the MLG is still on the ground and RadALT is close to ground, will G still be true?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Next, it is common when data fusing multiple inputs that there is a desire to clean up a signal before it is sampled digitally. This can remove effects such as switch bounce. The inclusion of low pass filters or hysteresis will generally add a propogation delay.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Q3: Is there a slow filter (Tc&gt;=1s) in the ground/air logic which could have caused a slight delay before G became false after takeoff further extending the opportunity of TMCA to activate?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Q4: Does TMCA act almost instantly or does it wait for the fault condition to stay asserted for a period of time before acting?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At that point, the total energy of the system would have comprised of the kinetic energy of the aircraft travelling at Vr, the rotational inertia of the engines and the potential energy of whatever fuel is beyond the cutoff valves.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Q5: Would this total energy have been sufficient to get the aircraft 100ft into the air?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It would still need a mechanism for at least one throttle input to each FADEC to misbehave at the same time. Resolvers are fed with an excitation signal to the rotor and take back two orthogonal signals (Cos and Sin) from stator windings. Usually, the excitation comes directly from the resolver-to-digital (R2D) circuit but sometimes an external signal source is used. I would hope that in an aircraft system, each channel would be kept independent of everything else.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Q6: Does the excitation signal for the 4 throttle resolvers (2 per side) come from 4 independent (internal) sources?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  My last thought for a single point of failure between both throttles would be a short between two wires or connection points carrying resolver signals, one from each side. Whether this could be caused by swarf wearing within a wiring loom, a foreign object moving about, crushed wires or even stretching of adjacent wires, I have absolutely no idea.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Q7: Do resolver signals from left or right, either channel A or B, run next to each other in a loom at any point?

     ... the gear, as far as I can establish (not openly published according to Google), weighs around 8-odd to 10 tonnes. Typically, retracts in about 10 seconds. I estimate it's no more than a 2 metre lift. As far as I can work out (using 3m to make the value higher), that requires about 30kW (rough estimate, budgetary figure, not accounting for it being a curved path, so it's probably higher closer to fully up), but whether wind pressure affects it, I have no idea. Anyway, 30kW isn't a huge (additional) load on a 225kVA alternator. Less than I'd imagined.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Now I'm wondering how big (power ratings) the hydraulic pump and motor are? No doubt, they're driven by a VSD. Can anyone comment, please?
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  The fixed doors on the landing gear are set at an angle that will ensure they assist gravity deployment in an emergency. During retraction that means the effort to stow the gear is increased due to these air loads. This is is standard on all the large aircraft I have worked on.
  <br/>
  As for hydraulic pumps, they are limited to how much flow they can produce. The pressure drops significantly during large control movements and the landing gear actuators in particular need a large flow to keep them moving.
  <br/>
  When all pumps are operating, engine driven or otherwise that pressure drop is limited, when down to just one small RAT driven pump there's only so much it can do and the design ensures that control of the aircraft can be maintained on just RAT power.
  <br/>
  There won't be enough power from the RAT generator to power emergency aircraft systems and large hydraulic pumps. This is why it has its own small hydraulic pump.

     Engineer not a pilot. Experience in analog front ends, A2D and R2D conversion and embedded systems generally but no specific knowledge of the 787 or GEnx.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I like everyone else have no evidence that TMCA played a role but given that it is one of the few systems with the ability to cut fuel to the engines, here are some thoughts on how signal processing could have extended the window of when TMCA could bite. In particular, I'm looking at the time immediately after the nose lifts up when something may have physically shifted onboard.
     <br/>
     I'll phrase it as a number of questions but realise that the few people who can answer may not be able to for now.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Thanks to tdracer's explanation on TMCA (albeit 747 not 787), we know that TMCA is a logic block within the FADEC whose only external inputs are a logic signal fron the aircraft that indicates whether it is on the ground or not and throttle position as determined by two independent resolvers per throttle side.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The logic would seem to be something of the form
     <br/>
     If (G AND (N2&gt;A OR N2&gt;B)) Then CutOffFuel()
     <br/>
     where G is true when the aircraft is on the ground,
     <br/>
     A is an envelope defined by throttle resolver channel A and

  Yes, overspeed on either resolver channel A or B alone will trip the TMCA fuel-cut logic

  G is a single Boolean that FADEC derives from Weight-On-Wheels (MLG and NW) and radio-altimeter. Iit stays \x93ground\x94 until all WOW sensors go inactive (i.e.
  <i>
   every
  </i>
  wheel is off the runway) and the RadALT exceeds its airborne threshold.

  That's very unlikely. Ground/air logic uses small hysteresis (tens to a few hundred ms), but not in the multi-second range

     Q5: Would this total energy have been sufficient to get the aircraft 100ft into the air?
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Let's do the math very quickly:
  <br/>
  Kinetic energy with a weight of 200,000kg, at Vr = 150kn = 77m/s: E_kin = 600MJ
  <br/>
  Rotational energy of a GEnX engine is hard to calculate as I don't find reliable values for the rotary inertia. I found some for a GE90 and could roughly estimate 100MJ of rotational energy for each engine. However, I seriously doubt that this energy could be effectively used to gain thrust, as the thrust will drop very quicjkly after the fuel is cut off.
  <br/>
  the required potential energy for a 100ft climb of a 200,000kg 787 is around 70MJ.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This ignores aerodynamic drag, still, 100 ft of climb remains energetically feasible.
  <br/>
  However, it as been pointed out several times that the actual climb was higher than 100ft. Already for 200ft I would doubt the validity of my statement above.

  I perfectly understand that there is much talking about TCMA here.
  <br/>
  There is no direct evidence of what caused the crash but several indirect evidences point towards a near simultaneous shutdown of both engines without any visual clue of a catastrophic mechanical mishap. This leads to suspecting near simultaneous fuel starvation of both engines.
  <br/>
  As the purpose of TCMA is shutting down the High Pressure Shut-Off Valve (HPSOV) and thus the fuel feed of an engine, it's normal to collect information on TCMA, on how it works, and on what data feeds it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, I hardly understand why there is no similar discussion about the spar valves and the systems that control their opening and closure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I understand that the B787 spar valves are located in the MLG well, or at least are maintained from within that well.
  <br/>
  If the engine shutdown happened when the gear retraction was commanded, that's a location commonality (although it's very unlikely that a mechanical problem happened in both wells at the same time).
  <br/>
  Also I understand that there are several systems that command the opening or closing of the spar valves:
  <br/>
  - opening: "Engine control panel switch" set to "START", or "Fuel control switch" set to "RUN"
  <br/>
  - closing: "Engine fire handle" pulled out. (I wonder if "Fuel control switch" set to "CUTOFF" also closes the spar valve).
  <br/>
  Are there direct wires running from these controls to the valves or is there a pair of control units receiving these signals and controlling the valve actuators?
  <br/>
  If the latter is true, where are these control units? I guess that the likely location is the aft EE bay. Are they beside each other?

  It's starting to look more like a massive electrical or computer issue which resulted in both engines failing, the landing gear may have been left down longer than normal due to startle effect.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It could be maintenance related or a latent condition in the B787 which only occurred due to the required factors all being present on this occasion i.e. the holes in the Swiss cheese all lined up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing and Air India will be wanting to blame each other, hopefully having the UK AAIB involved will provide a balance as they don't have a dog in the fight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If this turns out to be another MCAS, it will be difficult for Boeing to continue in it's present form. The B787 has been beset with problems since its introduction, the B777X has had numerous issues during development and the B737 is overdue for replacement. Airlines are starting to drop Boeing due to quality, safety and delivery issues. China is on the rise and if the C919 proves itself, it might be the main alternative to the A320.
