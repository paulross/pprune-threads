     Now, if you and Kraftstoffvondesibel wouldn't mind conducting similar audio analysis of a moped whizzing past, that might help to dispel one of the most popular competing theories.

  Alright, just because that isn't very difficult. The first segment is a Moped/motorcycle whizzing past. Not from the same city, but it is in India, and I listened to a number of them to find a representative one, and the closest I could find in lenght/timing that isn't completely out of bounds with the streets in the area the AI video was filmed. it is taken uncompressed from a professional sound library and is a very high quality recording. The sound source is in direct line of sight, much like the AI recording when the aircraft is presumably just coming into the clear from above the roof. A moped/motorcycle in the AI video, would probably not be direct line of sight down on the street, and would have an even more ambient character, but shorter ambience. The second segment is the Air India video.
  <br/>
  One thing we haven't discussed as a characteristic is how the AI recording moves from indirect sound with a shorter ambience, to direct sound, to a very much more ambient distant character in the same amount of time as the large aircraft moving overhead.
  <br/>
  The moped/motorcycle in the sample, keeps about the same small street ambience throughout.
  <br/>
  Notice how the harmonics are in different places with different spacing and with different relative intensity,  the emphasis on the internal combustion engine is lower in frequency than the open Rat, but with added exhaust noise.
  <br/>
  Thank you.

  I hesitate to chip in in these accident threads. Keep them clean. However, as as a few comments above brushes my audio expertise, I will comment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A very simple audio analysis give me this:
  <br/>
  The 3 segments horisontally, are of different videos of B787s passing overhead/landing. The vertical drop you see is the doppler effect.
  <br/>
  In other words, these are spectrograms over time which makes these distinctions easier than a simple static spectrogram.
  <br/>
  1. B787 landing with RAT extended.
  <br/>
  2.Air india crash
  <br/>
  3. B787 landing without RAT
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's a 5 minute laptop job, and it would look much prettier and clearer if I spent some time with it, (Gain to color match, and spectrally match to compensate for microphone placement and type),
  <br/>
  but it is 85% conclusive even when done as simple as this IMO.
  <br/>
  (I do have legal forensic audio experience)
  <br/>
  The RAT was out judging from the audio evidence. You can see the the equally spaced overtones of the propelller match when passing overhead resulting in the Doppler effect, the difference in length of the doppler is caused by distance and the slightly varying frequencies shown in the starting point is caused by a difference in speed. But the harmonic content match.
  <br/>
  In the 3rd segment you see none of these overtones at all.
  <br/>
  <br/>

  There has been much discussion here about RAT deployment. Various claims either way have been made, based on individual perspectives of available video and audio.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I am very mindful of just how awful a tragedy this is, and have significant misgivings about disproportionate interest in others misfortune where it carries no purpose, but also recognise that for some people knowing and learning what happened ASAP could be very important, particularly given the present circumstances.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thus while I sincerely hope that early detail from investigators will give some clarity, in an effort to reduce needless speculation regarding RAT deployment I have taken:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  (1) an audio sample from the video of AI171 passing by in which people claim to hear a RAT
  <br/>
  (2) an audio sample from a 787 video with RAT deployed on test by Boeing
  <br/>
  (3) an audio sample from a JAL 787 video with RAT deployed
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And passed these through a FFT in order to gain a more quantitative view of the noise spectra from each event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A spectrogram of the results is presented below. I hesitate to make any conclusions per se, but observe that there are similarities as well as divergences between them. In all three samples there is a relatively consistent signal roughly centered in the range 113-146Hz that could be what gives the characteristic 'buzz' sound of (apparently) a RAT in operation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  JAL ~141Hz
  <br/>
  Test ~146Hz
  <br/>
  AI171 ~113-134Hz (prob doppler variation here)
  <br/>
  <br/>

  <br/>
  <i>
   Spectral comparison #2 AI171, B787 with RAT, JAL 787 with RAT
  </i>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  These frequencies seem consistent(ish) with what I got from this video [[url]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1r3CuRwjPc] in which a 787 RAT is being tested - albeit in this case the blades are hydraulically powered and not driven as a turbine. This test showed a fundamental frequency of 135Hz with relevant harmonics above (the second harmonic at 270Hz is higher SPL, no weighting):
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>

  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's important to note that the initial recordings are necessarily different; these are not controlled conditions, the recording equipment is probably quite diverse and almost certainly not ideal, and the environmental conditions will also be different. Moreover all of these audio samples have come from video files referenced here, one has no way of determining the provenance or veracity of these sources and, crucially, I have no prior experience of analysing/extracting RAT acoustic fingerprints (nor have I sampled 'control' audio of a 787 passing by /without/ RAT!).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Additionally it's been quite a long time since I did any work with [turbine] noise so given these and other variables I'm not prepared to make any declarations per se, but perhaps more knowledgeable people could. That said, my feeling from what I see is that RAT deployment is not
  <i>
   dis
  </i>
  proven, and that the apparent fundamental frequency difference between the samples
  <i>
   may
  </i>
  be explainable by - amongst other things - difference in a/c airspeed, bearing in mind that AI171 was on TO, the others were landing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ultimately what I've done here is extremely rudimentary and while it would be possible to go into much more depth I'd hope that more definitive answer would be forthcoming by then, however if anyone wants to discuss specific methodology etc off-line please PM, no wish to add to noise on this thread.

   Calculation of a/c speed from audio analysis

  <div id="post_message_11903724">
   Further to the audio analysis of a deployed RAT; given an audio print, known noise source [RAT] frequency, location of a receiver and relative location + direction of moving object, and using the principles of doppler effect etc, it should be possible to calculate [ground]speed of a passing aircraft.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Thus, having been informed that the source frequency of a RAT is 145Hz (thank you that person - please ID yourself if you wish), and with regard to the [assumed] RAT acoustic print available for AI 171 we are close to being able to determine an approximate airspeed during descent (given the video from which we get this acoustic data appears to start during the descent).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   There are several variables in play here that we don't know exactly (the positions of observer and aircraft, height agl of observer and aircraft etc), and some I will ignore for the moment (effect of air temperature/pressure for example) but if one makes an educated assessment from the visual cues in the video I calculate an initial relative airspeed of circa 120kn. Necessarily this is an
   <i>
    extremely
   </i>
   rough number, in fact the range (making various positional assumptions etc) appears to be between ~100kn to ~150kn, but if it turned out be either side of this I wouldn't be completely surprised.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   As with the initial audio analysis to determine whether a RAT was deployed or not I offer this for those to whom this sort of data may be important. Not sure if it's of any real use or not, and I wouldn't hang your hat on it, but here it is in case it assists. Should it matter I expect some sort of corroboration could be obtained by making an assessment of vertical speed from the variously available videos and extrapolating from there.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   My previous caveats over veracity of source data etc remain.

     Maybe you should describe your analysis then and present the data? I'm a physicist so chances are I might actually not be so unfamiliar. Please include an analysis of raw data quality, spectral resolution and binning as well....

  As one of the two authors who have offered an acoustic analysis of the AI 171 'RAT' video here I feel obliged to make some observations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  First of all Kraftstoffvondesibel and I did our work completely without knowledge of each other. We reached the same conclusions more or less, most likely using different software (I used four different methodologies) and in subsequent discussions between us we've found our specific results (frequency etc) match very closely - including the doppler shift that we've also both commented on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While this doesn't absolutely
  <i>
   prove
  </i>
  the RAT scenario (I was, at least initially, somewhat more circumspect on this matter as anyone reading my first post would find) it does go some distance towards reconciling our respective methodologies and outcomes. Given the confluence and discussion I am now more satisfied that the RAT was deployed than I was before - although for the reasons espoused earlier I totally recognise the [scientific] challenges to this view.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In this regard I too would not 'mind' if our view regarding RAT deployment were proven incorrect. What Kraftstoffvondesibel and I have done is simply use a little science and apply a
  <i>
   quantitative
  </i>
  analysis to the available data that many had
  <i>
   qualitatively
  </i>
  argued over. One might hope that, amongst other things, it could have dispelled the RAT/no RAT question to some degree and reduce thread noise, but unfortunately it seems some haven't read the thread through, or perhaps lack analytical reasoning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This site isn't the place for a full academic paper+peer review and for me the real subject of this thread is the tragedy of AI 171 and what might determinable from what we know in the hope it will be useful to those closer to the coal face. If you are a physicist, scientist or engineer and have the capability then the same data we used is also available to you to do your own analysis. Should you do so we'd welcome hearing the outcome - whether it concurs with our results or not - as this is the scientific way. If you want to include the full nitty-gritty detail of how you've gone about then for a very small percentage of us that might be interesting, but it'd be peripheral to the main issue - and bear in mind that RAT deployment itself is merely an indicator of other potentially more serious issues. It is not likely to be the cause
  <i>
   per se
  </i>
  !
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To conclude, I understand it's a long thread but as far as the RAT question is concerned, I'd encourage you to read the relevant posts at least and if you remain unconvinced, and you have the skills, then why not conduct your own analysis and let us know the results? Otherwise perhaps as a group we could move on from this, remembering that this is a terrible event which at the very least deserves informed
  <i>
   useful
  </i>
  discussion rather than wild and/or repetitive speculation.

   While I get your light intent there is a reasonable question there, and one which was posited many posts ago.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   There are various reasons why the signatures we obtained are not that likely to be from a motorbike, but to answer briefly - and pictures being 1000 words 'n all that - here's a quick comparative [visual] analysis. At the top is a motorbike passing by away from the observer, the other is AI 171 doing the same thing:
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" class="post_inline_image" src="https://cimg9.ibsrv.net/gimg/pprune.org-vbulletin/573x429/mbike_v_ai171_f25f5edc4bfc71beb5cdf05ed3e3ceace0f8e433.jpg"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   I expect the difference will be clear. That said one could level a number of criticisms at the method I've used to show this, the sources obtained etc (eg. this is motorbike, not a moped as I couldn't find one in the time available), and if you really wanted to fake it one could, but I doubt that's occurred here.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Would say more but I'm short of time and think this is sufficient clear for now.

     B787 Skipper.... No longer able to sit on my hands!
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The joker that published one or other of the fictional accident reports before the dead are even identified needs stringing up by the thumbs.... Well done mods. OK, some of these theories, just bearing in mind the the flight recorder (there is only one FDR + CVR combined) was in the intact section of the undamaged tail and has been with the authorities for almost five days......
     <br/>
     <br/>
     - All you guys who are rushing down the TCMA rabbit hole: If it was established that a software error drove both engines to idle without warning, after rotate.... Don't you think the worldwide fleet of B787s would have been grounded by now? Such a glaring failure would be absolutely inescapable on the FDR.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Whatever was wrong with this aircraft was present at rotate, unbeknown to the crew. The fact that no ADs or notices to operators have been issued usually means that the cause is known and the aircraft was serviceable. The statement from a prominent Indian Captain about the skill and tenacity of the crew, right up to the last minute is absolutely laudable. However, the cynic in me says that the way is being paved for some bad news and by that I mean news that will do Air India reputational damage. Expect more management of expectation in the coming days.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I'm still going with
     <br/>
     a) Incorrect derate + low Vspeeds or
     <br/>
     b) Low altitude capture
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Maybe you should have kept sitting on your hands, theory a) in particular is about as risable as the last one you posted. Do you still think engine failure takes 30 seconds for the plane to react?! Thanks to rkenyon for alerting us not to take your post seriously. You still don't believe the RAT was out despite the in depth audio analysis done by an expert in the field. You still think its a motorbike?!
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Given they took off at a perfectly normal point, at a perfectly normal speed, I don't see how you come to incorrect derate and low v speeds, or how on earth that would lead to a normal takeoff followed by sinking?

  Hi all,
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sorry it&rsquo;s going to be a long one but seeing the level of competency here, I though it would be the perfect place to get my answers. From the precious messages read and answers received, I have a scenario to run. I am more than happy to be told wrong from point 1). I don&rsquo;t have the knowledge some of you do.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Please let me first start by saying that I am not trying to incriminate anyone. Hundreds of CRMS debriefs and accidents reports show us that unfortunately sometimes, the holes in that swiss cheese just do line up. It is far too easy for any of us, seating here, to judge any of the sequences happening in a Flight Deck. Mistakes happen, regardless of training and experience. We all do mistakes, every day, in every line of work.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  DISCLAIMER:
  <br/>
  I know that the consensus is a dual engine failure due to either TCMA bug or any sort of mecanical/software/wear and tear.
  <br/>
  I do hear a RAT (I don&rsquo;t see it though) and I do find the audio analysis quite compelling. It is at the top of my list as probable cause.
  <br/>
  I am just exploring another scenario, based on the AC&rsquo;s profile and state from grainy video and poor audio.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  1- Let&rsquo;s assume that we do all our perf calculation correctly. Is it possible that the OPT would spit up a F15/20 take off with the conditions on the day on a 787?
  <br/>
  2- If so, let&rsquo;s say we have performances for a F15/20 TO in the FMC. Now let&rsquo;s assume we select F5 for TO (not in the FMC, physically). Would there be an FMC message, or would that trigger the T/O warning on the 787? If it doesn&rsquo;t, we now potentially have an aircraft on the heavy side, with already a lift penalty on a high density altitude day.
  <br/>
  3- Please bear with me, I know so far I have made an awful lot of suppositions and assumptions. Murphy&rsquo;s law dictates that what can happen will happen albeit not on the same day. As it was answered to me by someone who was obviously seeing where I was going in a previous post, it&rsquo;s a lot of swiss cheese to line up.
  <br/>
  4- Take off roll goes on, Vr F15/20 comes and we rotate at a speed lower than we should for our actual F5 setting. My buddy calls for GEAR UP, I retract flaps to F1. Another lift penalty. Is there enough thrust now, or are we then already to deep on the back end of the drag curve ?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I do understand that this is not testable in a simulator. I am asking if someone with a 787 OPT and/or FCOM and knowledge views this scenario as possible or not (especially regarding the FMC message and the T/O warning). That is all.
  <br/>
  thanks for the help !

  Great summary. I've already mentioned the first below, but I'd add another:
  <ul>
   <li>
    The existence (and timing) of the flyby video by a young lad who apparently lived where the footage was shot from. With planes flying past every few minutes, why would he choose to film this one, before he could even see it? The video starts with the plane still approaching, out of view, and his position suggests it was unplanned, before he could move to a better vantage point. I say he already knew it was extraordinary - from the sound.
   </li>
   <li>
    Eye witness account from the mother of the lad who filmed the flyby, apparently said that the plane was "shaking". I'll assume she didn't know how to describe it properly, and that maybe it sounded like it was shaking, from hearing the noise from the RAT.  Or it's a translation issue of a word/s with multiple meanings or used colloquially.
   </li>
  </ul>
  One question - are there two exterior doors to the APU compartment, one on top, one below, presumably inlet and outlet of cooling airflow? I've seen photos showing two open doors, but the lower one could be something else, and busted open during the crash.

  <br/>
  <br/>
  <i>
   "Boeing explained that the RAT will remain operational as the airplane decelerates through the minimum RAT design speed of 120 knots, not 130 knots. Boeing expressed that the performance of the RAT was shown to meet the Boeing Model 787 requirement that specifies 120 knots as the minimum RAT design speed. We agree that the RAT will remain operational as the airplane decelerates through the minimum RAT design speed of 120 knots,
   <b>

   130 knots..."
