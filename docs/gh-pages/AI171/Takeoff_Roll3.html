  I am going by the list in the excellent post here:
  <a href="https://www.pprune.org/accidents-close-calls/666581-air-india-ahmedabad-accident-12th-june-2025-part-2-a-37.html#post11906480" target="_blank">
   Air India Ahmedabad accident 12th June 2025 Part 2
  </a>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anyway, here goes:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A. Misconfiguration or wrong takeoff data &mdash;
  <b>
   OUT
  </b>
  : 5 tons under MTOW, flaps 5, takeoff roll uneventful
  <br/>
  <br/>
  B. Flaps retracted post-takeoff instead of gear &mdash;
  <b>
   OUT
  </b>
  : flaps 5 still set at crash
  <br/>
  <br/>
  C. Low-altitude capture &mdash;
  <b>
   OUT
  </b>
  : throttle was at take-off thrust the whole time
  <br/>
  <br/>
  D. Loss of both engines at or shortly after rotation &mdash;
  <b>
   IN: confirmed
  </b>
  to have occurred 3-4 seconds after liftoff
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I. Bird strike/FOD &mdash;
  <b>
   OUT
  </b>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  II.Fuel-related
  <br/>
  1. Loss of electric fuel pumps &mdash;
  <b>
   OUT
  </b>
  <br/>
  2. Fuel contamination &mdash;
  <b>
   as good as OUT
  </b>
  , but lab work is ongoing
  <br/>
  3. Vapour lock &mdash;
  <b>
   OUT
  </b>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  III. Improper maintenance &mdash; mostly
  <b>
   OUT
  </b>
  , switches might have been defective
  <br/>
  <br/>
  IV. Large-scale electrical fault (e.g. due to water in E&amp;E bay) &mdash;
  <b>
   OUT
  </b>
  . This would have been obvious from the flight recorder.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  V. Shutdown of engines by TCMA &mdash;
  <b>
   OUT
  </b>
  . Conditions not met (not on ground, throttle not at idle)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  VI. (Inadvertent) shutdown by flight crew
  <br/>
  1. Spontaneous execution of memory items (fuel control switches OFF, then ON; deploy RAT) due to assumed engine malfunction &mdash;
  <b>
   OUT
  </b>
  from CVR
  <br/>
  2. No indications whatsoever of an intentional shutdown for nefarious reasons &mdash;
  <b>
   IN but unsupported
  </b>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  VII. Malfunction/mishandling of the fuel cutoff switches (most recent)
  <br/>
  1. Wear or improper operation of the switches, so that they do not lock but can shift back into the OFF position. &mdash;
  <b>
   IN

  </b>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  2. Spilled drink leading to short in the wiring &mdash;
  <b>
   IN (barely)
  </b>
  , 8 separate switch contacts must be affected in just the right way
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If you never supported any of the theories that are now out, pat yourself on the back!

  Not on the take-off roll. It was 3 seconds after liftoff.

    The Vr speed (155 kts) was achieved as per the EAFR at 08:08:35
    <br/>
    UTC. The aircraft air/ground sensors transitioned to air mode, consistent with liftoff at 08:08:39 UTC.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The aircraft achieved the maximum recorded airspeed of 180 Knots IAS at about 08:08:42 UTC and immediately thereafter, the Engine 1 and Engine 2 fuel cutoff switches transitioned from RUN to CUTOFF position one after another with a time gap of 01 sec.

  <u>
   Language:
  </u>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Having lived in the Middle East for over 20 years, I am somewhat used to the Indian use of the English language. Therefore, I wouldn't look too closely at the usage of "transitioned"; it simply means moving from one condition to another.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The conversation of the pilots, on the other hand, will be very interesting. It should be analysed in the language they were speaking, considering whether this was their native language to start with. I assume that the conversation was in Hindi, translated to English for the report. In that case alone, a lot of nuance might have been lost in translation. That's without even considering the tone, volume etc. of the conversation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <u>
   Procedure:
  </u>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I am an Airbus driver, so I am not familiar with the B787 EICAS. On the Bus, the ECAM would generate an
  <u>
   ENG
  </u>
  FAIL, followed shortly thereafter by an
  <u>
   ENG
  </u>
  ALL ENGINE FAILURE. I assume the B787 would have a similar event on the EICAS. Now, considering the time frame of how quickly things happened, there is absolutely no reason for the pilots to assume something was wrong with both engine cutoffs, unless they were physically switched off by someone. We are not trained to consider a fuel cutoff switch as the main reason for an engine failure, especially on the takeoff roll.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <u>
   Question?
  </u>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When I was a young F/O, some of the captains I flew with had the (annoying) habit of resting their hands just behind the thrust levers on their PM (PNF) sectors to 'be ready' to reject the takeoff. This would put the hands in the vicinity of the Fuel Cutoffs, which would, in turn, increase the chances of an unintended action on these switches. Is this a possibility, or am I way off?
