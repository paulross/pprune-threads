     For an aircraft that will likely have TOGA pressed and be at a high power setting (plus the RAT deployed) it sounds awfully quiet.
     <br/>
     Perhaps the gear was down because they knew they were going to force land due to lack of thrust.
     <br/>
     (Only a 738 driver), but the electric pumps to drive the hydraulics is much slower than the engine driven pumps and so flap selection / re-selection could be not as expected.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     RIP to all involved.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  787 gear and flaps/slats are both on the centre system, powered by 2x
  <i>
   big
  </i>
  electric pumps and no EDPs, so retraction should be minimally impacted by engine failure assuming electric power was still available and reconfiguration worked. Note the 787 has two generators per engine so generator failure is also unlikely to contribute, unless both engines failed taking out all four generators (and presumably no APU running).

     Assuming we're not facing a repeat of the Boeing 737‑800 crash at Muan International Airport when loss of loss of both engines apparently also cut power to Flight Data Recorder (FDR) and Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR)

   </div>
  </div>
  From that thread, I believe it was discussed that on most/all other large transports, deploying the RAT re-powers the CVR/FDR. The 737 didn't have that happen because no RAT. You may still get a few second gap while the RAT deploys.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 787 has 2x Enhanced Airborne Flight Recorders (EAFR), which each record both cockpit voice and flight data.
  <strike>
   I expect they are also fitted with the dedicated batteries that the Jeju was a year or two too early to require.

   Per the NTSB

  , the forward recorder has a 10-minute backup battery.

  Hopefully flight data is not going to be an issue for this investigation.

     Also, what is this discussion about the RAT? Unless someone has extremely quickly faked the audio on the video, it is pretty clear that the engines were running. (Both of them, there is some slight interference pattern I (maybe imagine) to hear.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  The suggestion is that the buzzsaw/propeller sound is the RAT; it does sound a bit like an interference pattern, but you don't get the engine roar with it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's also maybe visible in a few stills (e.g. post 64).

     What are the electrical systems like on the 787?
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Two 225kVA generators per engine (plus two on the APU). Directly driven with no constant speed drives so they are variable frequency. That is converted to high voltage DC and distributed around the plane. So, four or six independant sources.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several load distribution centers, where the DC is supplied to various loads and in some cases converted to 28Vdc, 400Hz AC, or other levels as required by the loads. The switching between alternate sources would depend on each load buses criticality. There are also those lithium ion standby/starting batteries available. So, theoretically very redundant. But highly complex systems also suffer from the possibility of hidden faults which may escape certification testing and analysis. We'll see.

  Forgive me if appear to be being a bit pedantic but the 787 does not have IDGs and BUGs.
  <br/>
  Each engine has two identical Variable Frequency Starter Motor Generators.
  <br/>
  They are a combined starter motor and generator.

  #3 would be the TAT and thus N1 Max on this very hot day.  Nothing abrupt, but cumulative?  Get hot enough and N2 limit can make hot day line steeper. But likely latched DT, which I recall was to deal with inversions. At 42C, likely used full-rated TKO.  Also would be useful to know engine health, residual margins.  Blast through EGT, stop at N2.

     And your post squarly falls within the categories you describe in your first paragraph. I have, and still am flying 757/767s, flown probably around 40 examples from early to late production planes AND EVERY SINGLE ONE had a RAT.

  You are quite correct. Every wide body Boeing (and Airbus) twin plus the 747-8 has a RAT - Some drive a generator and/or some drive a hydraulic pump. The reason for the 748 having a RAT is that for a 3 or more engine flameout (Boeing speak for a 4 engine flameout) the EDP&rsquo;s are depressurised to unload the gearbox for ease of windmilling. Hence, no engines = no hydraulics. Edited to clarify the different reasons for the RAT. Edited to add every &ldquo;wide body&rdquo;

  A220 has a RAT - so does the E-jets and the Sukhoi Superjet. You're right on the 737 and I'd forgotten the 717...

    Both the 737 and the DC-9 derivatives can be flown without hydraulic/electric assist by some form of manual reversion. That is pretty much the RAT's sole reason for existence, so one is not necessary.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The A220/A3*0/757/767/777/787 can't be flown without some kind of flight control assist, so needs a RAT. Even the DC-10 and L1011 had RATs.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The 747 excluding -8 didn't have a RAT because four windmilling engines were deemed to provide enough hydraulics.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Edit: I believe the
    <i>
     Hydraulic Driven Generator
    </i>
    was optional on the 757/767. While every aircraft had a RAT to provide hydraulics, electrics would solely be on battery. The optional HDG extended battery life from ~30 minutes (good enough for gliding) to indefinite (ETOPS requirement, probably).

  I can only reiterate what I said, you can disagree if you like, I don\x92t have any current 767 documentation anymore (been off it for almost 10 years), I can 100% say that across all of the the 30+ airframes, 2 different  models -200/300ER and 3 engine combinations (PW, GE, RR) that I flew... NONE OF THOSE 30+ airframes had a RAT. Maybe yours do? I don\x92t know. Feel free to post some 767-200/300 FCOM information if you have it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  What the 767s I flew did have, was a hydraulic generator (or 2 in some cases), but that sure ain\x92t a RAT.

  FR24 data appears to stop shortly after airborne but well before impact.
  <br/>
  That would seem to align with the significant loss of electrics as a result of loss of engine generators theory?
  <br/>
  Flaps prematurely retracted shouldn\x92t be a cause of loss of electrical power to the transponder.  If electrical power was normal then one would have expected data info until impact, regardless of flap position.

  Reading the various reports about electrical problems on the prior and this flight, such as flickering lights reminded me of the BMI A321 incident discussed here 15 years ago:

  A faulty generator caused all sorts of problems with control of the aircraft.  It is a reminder that complete electrical failure is not the only failure mode.  Shutting down the faulty generator on that aircraft recovered the situation, but they had time and altitude on their side.

  One thing which could cause simultaneous unexpected idle power is the autothrottle. I'm thinking about this, leading to a crew too startled to retract the gear and too distracted to push the thrust levers forward, as a possible cause. As others have said, the RAT could have been manually deployed - an action which would make sense to pilot convinced that he was about to lose both engine driven generators.

     The Dreamliner as two identical \x93Enhanced Airborne Flight Recorders\x94, one in the tail section and one beneath the flight deck. Each one contains the CVR + FDR in one module, both have 10 minutes of battery power backup. I see reports that the one in the tail section has been recovered.

  It's fine that the \x93Enhanced Airborne Flight Recorders\x94 have 10 minutes battery backup. If the bits of equipment/sensors sending data to be recorded don't have power, you will be recording 10 minutes of silence/blank data.

  IIRC the CVR battery (in this case EAFR battery) is required to power at least the cockpit area microphone, if not the pilots' mics.

  Once the RAT deployed at least some data should have come back.

     Now, I am probably wrong about this, but if you forget to set the altitude window to the first altitude in departure and leave it at 0 (which with some airlines the previous crew will do on shutdown) the following might possibly occur. At 50 feet LNAV engages, at 100 feet the autopilot engages, at 400 feet VNAV engages but as the altitude window is set to 0 the aircraft (on autopilot) now descends to capture 0 feet. The speed at this point in VNAV is low (max V2 + 20 kts) so, to maintain that, both thrust levers close. This, of course, would be totally unexpected and could have a startle effect. If you do not realise what has caused this you might think that there is a problem with the engines and you have very little time to deal with it. I would suggest that putting out a Mayday call at this stage is not a good use of time.

     As I stated at the beginning this is probably very unlikely and may not be possible, but could be tried in a simulator.

  This has been discussed upthread and has happened before (on a 777 IIRC) but did not result in a crash.

  It does not explain the RAT and generally you would expect crews to shove the thrust levers fully forward.

  30 secs to 100 kts from TO power set.and 200 kts after 60 seconds
  <br/>
  Impact occurred 30 secs after Vr 1 nm out, so about 120 kts and no more than 300ft
  <br/>
  The gear was not or could not be retracted.
  <br/>
  Without doubt the crew knew impact was inevitable at least 10 seconds prior to impact noted by body angle change in video evidence

  I think that the only thing that would matter for any of us in that 20 seconds would be THRUST and everything it's got.

  Which occurred first, the loss of thrust on both engines causing all generators to go offline or a total electrical failure that caused flight Idle thrust.

     One thing which could cause simultaneous unexpected idle power is the autothrottle. I'm thinking about this, leading to a crew too startled to retract the gear and too distracted to push the thrust levers forward, as a possible cause. As others have said, the RAT could have been manually deployed - an action which would make sense to pilot convinced that he was about to lose both engine driven generators.

  There would be way much going on for anyone to even think about deploying the RAT. They've literally just left the ground and find themselves in a state where the plane is not climbing for a currently unkown reason. If you haven't thought to advance the thrust levers fully you definitely won't be looking up to the overhead panel to press deploy the ram air turbine during a critical phase of flight.
