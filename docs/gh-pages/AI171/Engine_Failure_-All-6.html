     Why the need to make the two theories fit in such a convoluted manner? Inadvertent flap retraction was theorised because people assumed that was most likely to have caused the loss of lift - hardly anyone believed dual engine failure was possible. Now we know that the loss of lift was indeed almost certainly caused by a loss of engine power,

     The recordings are simply of too low quality to draw any conclusions from.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     If it was dual engine failure shortly after rotation, that is very bad luck and I doubt any crew could recover from something like that.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I could speculate further but I think it\x92s just too hard to say without better quality footage or FDR data.

  Reports say that one of the black boxes have been recovered and the search continues for the other one. Apparently the B787 flight recorders log voice as well as data so only one is suffice if not damaged.

  <br/>
  <br/>
  There have been numerous crashes and serious incidents linked to this logic functioning incorrectly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some engineering tests require the air/ground switch to be set in a particular mode. If it's inadvertently left in engineering mode&mdash;or if the system misinterprets the mode&mdash;this can cause significant problems.
  <br/>

    <b>
     On the ground
    </b>
    , if the aircraft is incorrectly in

  <br/>
  <br/>
  There&rsquo;s precedent: an A320 pilot once inadvertently shut down both engines over Paris. Fortunately, the crew managed to restart them. Afterward, the pilot reportedly couldn&rsquo;t explain his actions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If something similar happened here, then when the pilots realized the engines had stopped producing thrust, pushing the levers forward would have had no effect.

  Speaking personally, when I shut down engines at the end of a flight, I consciously force myself to operate each fuel switch
  <i>

  On item 1, the TCMA issue should have been fixed, it does fit the sort of issue that occurred here. TDRACER can talk to that, and has done in 2019 and again in post 792. As to flap auto retraction, the B787 like all Boeings has a gated flap lever, and the flaps are only able to move independent of the lever by flap load relief. That would not have caused a loss of thrust, and in this case it is evident that the event is a thrust loss not a CL loss.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On item 2, the video shows no asymmetry at any time, so there is only a symmetric failure of the engines possible. Back on a B747 classic, you could chop all 4 engines at the same time with one hand, on a B737, also, not so much on a B777 or B787. I would doubt that anyone used two hands to cut the fuel at screen height. Note, there was a B744 that lost one engine in cruise when a clip board fell off the coaming. Didn't happen twice, and it only happened to one engine.

     Yes indeed, the moment they pulled the gear lever, as we see the gear begin the retraction process, and then suddenly stop. Almost as if they suddenly lost power.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     We can see the landing gear retraction process begin. We see the bogies tilted in the second video. We can hear the RAT. We can see the RAT. We can see the flaps extended in the video and at the crash site. There isn't actually a single piece of evidence the flaps were raised, it's just a conclusion people jumped too before evidence began to emerge.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The crazy thing is, when the report comes out and there is no mention of flaps none of the people who have been pushing the flap theory will self reflect or learn anything. They'll think those of us who didn't buy into it were just lucky, rather than it being down to use of fairly simple critical thinking.

  Neila83 is correct, the gear tilt pre retraction is rear wheels low, and at the commencement of the selection of the retraction cycle (generally),
  <strike>
   the first thing that happens is the inboard MLG doors start to open below the wheel well and then the bogie is driven to front wheels low.
  </strike>
  (There is also an option that the inboard gear doors start to open early as a result of WOW sensing to improve the SSL climb limit). [my bad, for the B788 Capt Bloggs informs us the gear door sequence is after the tilt, not before, the B789 has the before tilt, the option for the door open at rotate is separate]
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <strike>
   The inboard doors do not appear to have opened in this case, yet, the gear is forward wheels down. This appears to be out of sequence. TD may have better knowledge on the options that exist with the B788, but this is not looking good at this time.
  </strike>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There is enough in the way of anomalies here to end up with regulatory action, and airlines themselves should/will be starting to pore over their systems and decide if they are comfortable with the airworthiness of the aircraft at this moment. A latent single point of failure is not a comfortable place to be. Inhibiting TCMA might be a good interim option, that system could have been negated by having the
  <b>
   ATR ARM switches....(Both)... ARM
  </b>
  deferred to the before takeoff checks. The EAFR recovery should result in action within the next 24-48 hours. Boeing needs to be getting their tiger teams warmed up, they can ill afford to have a latent system fault discovered that is not immediately responded to, and the general corporate response of
  <i>
   "blame the pilots"
  </i>
  is not likely to win any future orders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I think we are about to have some really busy days for the OEM.

  Speaking as a B787 Captain..... There is so much rubbish and stupid suggestion being written here.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This aircraft was airborne for a grand total of 22 seconds, half of which was climbing to no more than 150' aal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - No Flaps? Due to the setup of the ECL it is physically impossible to go down the runway without some sort of take-off flap set. The T/o config warning would have been singing it's head off. Despite assertions to the contrary I have seen no video clear enough to detect a lack of flaps.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - RAT out? Almost impossible, I have seen no quality footage that definitively witnesses the RAT being out. Those who think they car hear a RAT type noise might be listening to a motorcycle passing or similar. It takes a triple hydraulic failure or a double engine failure to trigger RAT deploment. They happily went through V1 without a hint of rejected take off so as they rotated the aircraft was serviceable. These are big engines, they take a long time to wind down when you shut them down. I have never tried it however engine failure detection takes 30s or for the aircraft to react and they were not even airborne that long.
  <br/>
  - Flaps up instead of gear? The B787 flaps are slow both in and out. Given that the 'Positive rate' call is not made the second the wheels leave the ground, a mis-selection of flaps up would not cause any loss of lift for at least 20 seconds, by which time they had already crashed. I believe the gear remained down not because of mis-selection but because of a major distraction on rotate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Discounting the impossible, two hypotheses remain:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  1. Invalid derate set through incorrect cross-checking. Trundling down the runway takes very little power to reach Vr. It is only when you rotate that you create more drag and discover that you do not have sufficient thrust vs. drag to sustain a climb. Or....
  <br/>
  2. Put 200' as the altitude target in the FCU. Immediate ALT capture and all the power comes off. PF is still hand flying trying to increase pitch but is already way behind the aircraft.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It could be after this that Boeing are forced to review the B787 practice of exploring the very edges of the performance envelope.

  How would 'all the power come off' at 150ft AAL when the Autothrottle would still be in HOLD mode (until 400ft) and therefore be unable to move?

     I've been closely examining a video frame captured very early in the footage depicting the aircraft's final moments. In this particular frame, I believe the
     <b>
      left main landing gear (MLG) door is clearly visible in the open position
     </b>
     , while the
     <b>
      right MLG door appears closed
     </b>
     . Additionally, both
     <b>
      main gear bogies are noticeably tilted forward
     </b>
     \x97 a configuration that typically occurs at the initiation of the gear retraction sequence.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     This combination strongly suggests that a
     <b>
      gear retraction was commanded
     </b>
     , but the
     <b>
      sequence was interrupted and never completed
     </b>
     . What\x92s particularly striking is the
     <b>
      asymmetry
     </b>
     \x97 the left door open, the right door closed \x97 which should not occur during normal operations and points toward a possible
     <b>
      hydraulic failure scenario
     </b>
     during retraction.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     As many will know, on the Boeing 787-8,
     <b>
      each main gear door is hydraulically actuated and powered by its respective side\x92s hydraulic system
     </b>
     \x97 the
     <b>
      left gear door by the left hydraulic system
     </b>
     , and the
     <b>
      right by the right
     </b>
     . This leads me to propose the following hypothesis:
     <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
      <li>
       Shortly after rotation, with a positive rate of climb established, the
       <b>
        flight crew commands gear up
       </b>
       .
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       The
       <b>
        gear retraction sequence initiates
       </b>
       ; the
       <b>
        main gear bogies tilt forward
       </b>
       , consistent with the start of retraction.
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       <b>
        The right engine fails first
       </b>
       , resulting in a
       <b>
        loss of right hydraulic system pressure
       </b>
       . Consequently, the
       <b>
        right MLG door does not open
       </b>
       .
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       The
       <b>
        left MLG door, still powered by the left hydraulic system, opens
       </b>
       .
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       <b>
        Moments later, the left engine also fails
       </b>
       , leading to
       <b>
        loss of the left hydraulic system
       </b>
       . With the door now open but no remaining hydraulic pressure,
       <b>
        the left main gear remains extended and the door remains open
       </b>
       .
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       The
       <b>
        ram air turbine (RAT) deploys
       </b>
       , consistent with total engine and electrical power loss.
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       With the
       <b>
        loss of thrust from both engines
       </b>
       , the aircraft loses lift and enters an unrecoverable descent, tragically ending in impact.
       <br/>
      </li>
     </ol>
     This sequence would explain the
     <b>
      partially completed gear retraction
     </b>
     and the
     <b>
      asymmetric gear door position
     </b>
     observed in the video evidence. It\x92s worth noting that the timing of the hydraulic losses would have to be
     <b>
      very close together
     </b>
     \x97 potentially within seconds \x97 which aligns with a
     <b>
      dual engine failure shortly after take-off
     </b>
     . In such a scenario,
     <b>
      asymmetric thrust would be minimal or non-existent
     </b>
     , making the aircraft\x92s attitude appear otherwise stable in its descent.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Further supporting this theory are:
     <ul>
      <li>
       <b>
        Eyewitness reports of a loud bang
       </b>
       , possibly indicating an engine failure.
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       A
       <b>
        mayday call
       </b>
       reportedly made by the crew.
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       The
       <b>
        audible presence of the RAT
       </b>
       in the video, suggesting a complete loss of engine-driven electrical and hydraulic systems.
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       The
       <b>
        noticeable absence of typical engine noise
       </b>
       , supporting the hypothesis of dual engine failure.
       <br/>
      </li>
     </ul>
     This scenario would offer a tragically plausible explanation for the aircraft\x92s behavior and the observed configuration in its final moments. Of course, the
     <b>
      official investigation will provide the definitive answers
     </b>
     , and we must await their findings.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     In the meantime, my thoughts are very much with all those affected by this heartbreaking event.

      NOTE:
     </b>
     Unfortunately this is my first post here. I wanted to upload the frame for all to see but the forum is restricting me from doing this until I reach 8 posts. I can't link to it via a URL either. I studied a frame from the very start of the video, just as the full aircraft enters view and expanded it by 400% allowing me to see the position of the MLG doors).
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I have no knowledge about 787, but every landing gear system I\x92ve worked with did not sequence Left and Right MLG to retract and extend with each other. In fact it is typical for left and right side to move at slightly different speed due to different friction etc. Retraction assymmetry is probably not a clue to this mystery.

     Speaking as a B787 Captain..... There is so much rubbish and stupid suggestion being written here.

     This aircraft was airborne for a grand total of 22 seconds, half of which was climbing to no more than 150' aal.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     - No Flaps? Due to the setup of the ECL it is physically impossible to go down the runway without some sort of take-off flap set. The T/o config warning would have been singing it's head off. Despite assertions to the contrary I have seen no video clear enough to detect a lack of flaps.

     <br/>
     - RAT out? Almost impossible, I have seen no quality footage that definitively witnesses the RAT being out. Those who think they car hear a RAT type noise might be listening to a motorcycle passing or similar. It takes a triple hydraulic failure or a double engine failure to trigger RAT deploment. They happily went through V1 without a hint of rejected take off so as they rotated the aircraft was serviceable. These are big engines, they take a long time to wind down when you shut them down. I have never tried it however engine failure detection takes 30s or for the aircraft to react and they were not even airborne that long.
     <br/>
     - Flaps up instead of gear? The B787 flaps are slow both in and out. Given that the 'Positive rate' call is not made the second the wheels leave the ground, a mis-selection of flaps up would not cause any loss of lift for at least 20 seconds, by which time they had already crashed. I believe the gear remained down not because of mis-selection but because of a major distraction on rotate.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Discounting the impossible, two hypotheses remain:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     1. Invalid derate set through incorrect cross-checking. Trundling down the runway takes very little power to reach Vr. It is only when you rotate that you create more drag and discover that you do not have sufficient thrust vs. drag to sustain a climb. Or....
     <br/>
     2. Put 200' as the altitude target in the FCU. Immediate ALT capture and all the power comes off. PF is still hand flying trying to increase pitch but is already way behind the aircraft.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     It could be after this that Boeing are forced to review the B787 practice of exploring the very edges of the performance envelope.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  No argument on the flaps.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The engines, however: yes they take a long time to wind down
  <i>
   fully
  </i>
  , but they don't take long to stop providing thrust if you shut them down or cut the fuel (or indeed have a bird strike). I don't understand why you consider a loss of thrust to be an impossible hypothesis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There's also a still image above which appears to show a deployed RAT; that's even if we discount the sound track, which might indeed be something else than a RAT, and ignore the sound of the crash being clearly audible despite the lack of engine noise earlier in the video.

  I have to agree with everything here except your assertion about engine shutdown.
  <br/>
  Even though these are big engines with plenty of inertia, when you select engine shut off they spool down very quickly if on load. IE, The generators, two per engine and hydraulic pumps, etc, being driven by the (relatively) small mass of the N2 rotor will drag the speed down very quickly, the gennies will trip offine in seconds, the pumps will quickly reduce flow and pressure.
  <br/>
  As for what went wrong.
  <br/>
  If the engines have stopped working there has to be a common failure mode, fuel is one but as has been said, no other aircraft has had a problem, as far as we know. FOD? It would have to be something major to shut down two GeNX engines and there would be debris all over the runway, we would know by now.
  <br/>
  I have no idea if the RAT has deployed, I can't see it in the video and the noise could be something else.
  <br/>
  We shall see.
  <br/>
  There is compelling evidence that flaps are set correctly and not retracted inadvertently.
  <br/>
  I await further evidence.
  <br/>
  Edit to add. LAE 40 years, type rated on 737 to 787 with lots of others in between.

  neither of these make much sense to me though as surely the 787 has high alpha as well as low speed envelope protections. reaching either of these states the plane\x92s protections should\x92ve kicked in right? I\x92m still yet to see evidence of a screaming engine in the last moments which would be conducive with the plane applying TOGA when entering a low energy state

  the ALT capture is what caught EK\x92s 777 out in DBX right? I still can\x92t think of a logical reason why they continued to allow ALT capture below thrust reduction height (depending on your operator 400-1000 AGL), that seems like a latent threat.

  Can you state the source of your information? I have no way of independently verifying what I've provided. According to that, however, the two center tank pumps are higher pressure than the L/R tank pumps and will override them if both are activated. So the center tank fuel is used first, then the L/R tank pumps. If no pumps are operating, the engines can suction fuel from their respective L or R tanks provided there's enough atmospheric pressure. The end result is still that an empty center tank cannot cause an engine shutdown absent some other malfunction.

  Virtually everything in this post is wrong. The 787 fuel system is almost the same as the 767. The default setup is all fuel pumps on. Each wing tank sends fuel to the left or right respective manifold. The center (main) tank pumps send fuel to both manifolds and operate at a higher pressure than the wing tanks and will feed the manifolds for each side from its left or right pump before the wing tanks. If there is fuel in the center tank it is always burned first and directly supplies the manifolds to the engines. Once the center tank is empty the wing tanks then begin supplying fuel to their respective manifolds. If any pumps are inadvertently left off you will get a EICAS message and a light in the pump switch.

     Trying repeatedly to follow the whole thread plus updates but loading on the iPhone constantly jumps backwards and forwards making it a struggle to cover everything.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Two points which may or may not have relevance. One is just before the final crash, a dark-looking cover(?) flies up into the air. Could this be the first contact with sound that the surviving passenger alleges he heard?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Secondly the cost of aviation fuel seems to be comparatively more expensive in India than either Japan (leg before) or the UK (following leg). Would this effect refuelling procedures within India, supposing a company directive to save when possible?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     (Frequent long-haul passenger.)
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Good grief! They uploaded less fuel to save money??? That made the plane immediately sink to oblivion&hellip;because what? They ran out of fuel? You think airports all over India restrict fuel and endanger countless aircraft daily? It is the Captain&rsquo;s prerogative to sign off on fuel upload.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But let&rsquo;s run with it. Less fuel = lighter load. So&hellip;how does that make lift off/climb a more difficult procedure??? It shouid have been easier. How does that result in rapid loss of lift? Did they finish their tablespoon of fuel?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Or - if you are hinting at fuel contamination by being &ldquo;watered down&rdquo; somehow&hellip;why were no other aircraft affected? You might wish to consider Cathay Pacific flight 780, which suffered a serious fuel contamination incident. The problem was not initialiy detectable, but some engine underperformance was noted in one engine fairly early into the flght. The problems compounded during the flght from Surabaya to Hong Kong, culminating in complete engine shutdown. Fortunately, due to the experience and skill of Captain and Copilot, they just - only just - managed to land safely in Hong Kong. Point is - a crash scenario did not unfold in seconds.

     No. Mainly because it relates to a 10 year old AD.
    </div>
   </div>

  Still valid Dave. That AD was raised circa post #248 (Search thread for \x93AD\x94)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All four Variable Frequency Generators (2 per engine) going offline at once is too much of a coincidence not to mention that AD.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  RAT deployment has been substantiated, which occurs automatically, extension of which takes about 6 secs &amp; would be heard by pax in the cabin as a loud \x93bang\x94 as the leg locks into place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The sole on-board survivor quote regarding flickering green/white lights (Emergency Exit lights) directly adjacent to his seat 11A, speaks to electrical disruption during the takeoff phase.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If the double engine failure or electrical bus/distribution failure causing loss of thrust occurred for a reason other than the AD mentioned above, the cause will need to be established without delay lest the void is filled with mis-information, fear, uncertainty, &amp; doubt.
  <br/>
  The current level of trust in the manufacturer is fragile for good reason.
  <br/>
  .
  <br/>
  This occurrence will have operators &amp; regulators around the world reviewing their risk assessment models, especially regarding Master Minimum Equipment List (MMEL)/ Defect Deferral Guide (DDG) maintenance relief.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Compliance &amp; maintenance come at a cost.
  <br/>
  Lack thereof comes at a far greater &amp; heavier cost.

     Speaking of invalid derate, I sort of recall reading about an incident with a very heavy aircraft and some kind of mistake or fault (or maybe both?) leading to insufficient takeoff thrust on a hot day. Fortunately the crew was able to stabilise the aircraft and return safely to the airport, but unfortunately I don't remember any more details, and so finding it has been difficult.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Might that incident shed any light on this one, especially since that crew
     <i>
      was
     </i>
     able to recover?
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  <br/>
  Are you thinking of the EK A340 that departed with a 100 ton descepancy entered in the box resulting in incorrect thrust derate and under cooked V speeds? That aircraft was saved by the flight crew that fire walled the thrust leavers with about 600M remaining. Tail strike and destroyed the LOC antenta, but was able to get Airbourne then return for landing at YMML. Is this a possibility? 100 ton gross error, resulting in incorrect thrust, speeds and flap setting? Pilot mistakes lack of thrust for partial engine failure? The confusion and startle factor as the aircraft is rotating with a surprising lack of thrust and the runway end fast approaching may account for the gear not being selected up. If there were a gross error in the weight entered in the FMC, no takeoff config warning. 40 degrees C, flaps 5 instead of flaps 15 or similar? Hopefully some initial data from the FDR may be a pretty good indication.

  Hard to imagine if that mistake was made he\x92d get on the radio saying engines losing power with out pushing levers up first ? What ever happened had  guy in left seat stunned ? My opinion only , if he was a training Capt he , like most guys in the left keep a good watch on where hands go . If an incorrect weight, chances are he\x92d know on runway and thrust to TOGA , those engines appear to be along way off producing thrust . If flap was raised by mistake , flap can be lowered just as quick . He\x92d not be on radio saying thrust decreasing while looking at flap up . If miss set alt hold he\x92d be calling modes and selecting higher altitude and changing  climb mode thinking he\x92s got to remember to write a report on arrival . If engines turned off deliberately!! Big If , no need for radio calls , turn engines back on and protect them and try isolating flight controls, if possible .
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If RAT out ??? That tells a lot .
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Not long to wait now ?

  condolences to family\x92s and loved ones !

  This got me thinking about a report I read where an Auckland based maintenance facility added too much biocide to an aircraft fuel tank by a factor of ten. From memory the Engineer simply read the instructions wrong or calculated the additive amount incorrectly and the cross checking systems were either not in place or they failed. I searched online for it but could only find the following;

  So my point is, if we are speculating about fuel contamination causing dual engine failure, it is possible that a fuel contaminant is specific to a particular airframe and not the supply system. Obviously not saying that is what happened here, but it goes to show how many possibilities exist.

   A few posts earlier desmotronic mentions the sole survivor saying he could feel thrust increasing. In addition he mentioned a loud bang just before impact. At no point has the survivor been quoted saying all engine power stopped, or the noise of the engines completely stopped. Even thrust reduction after takeoff is very noticeable in the cabin, so imagine if both engines would have quit. Not to discount anything at this stage, but this is puzzling regarding the double engine failure scenario (based on some grainy images of a RAT maybe being extended).

     Ex petroleum lab technician and tank farm sampler here. We would occasionally get fuel samples from crashed aircraft to test for contamination. One test was for water and sediment/microorganism sludge.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     In this accident, fuel contamination continues to be dismissed as a cause, because no other aircraft have reported issues. But there has been no discussion regarding the airport's fuel storage, transfer, or filtration systems. Water and sediment naturally settles at the bottom of fuel storage tanks. If this aircraft received fuel drawn from the bottom of a storage tank, in the absence of a proper filtration system, it\x92s possible that it was contaminated. The next aircraft may have received fuel from a different storage tank with good fuel.

  Fuel contamination is certainly a valid theory. The main thing working against it is that it would seem from the aircraft's flight path is that both engines failed at exactly the same time and lost thrust simultaneously. The chances of this are non zero, but remote. I say that as there appears to be no yaw, or other controlling of the aircraft - either by pilot or automation - that would suggest an asymmetric thrust scenario, even for a few seconds.

  Yes, Jetstar had the biocide issue but did not immediately hit both engines within seconds of each other.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's my understanding that both engines draw fuel from independent sources during that time (which may be fed from a common source (eg central tank). But again, the odds of both failing at the exact same instant is low, but not zero.
