     Such a fault in a multi pole switch would be odd. And in two switches at roughly the same time?
     <br/>
     Typically you'd have a fault in one set of poles, giving you conflicting data.
     <br/>
     Such as the EAFR registers a fuel switch in cutoff, but the fuel did not actually cut off.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Don't forget that the RAT deployed instantly, shortly after liftoff, agreeing that both switches were in CUTOFF.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Yes - conflicting data issuing a warning when the system being controlled has no fault. That's a problem at considerable expense for a rare occurrence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Literally covering all the bases with a video would not only show what the switch status was but also how it got there, if it has an immediate effect, which a second line would not do.

     From the report, there is no indicated time stamp identifying the point when one pilot asked the other "why did you cut off"
     <br/>
     This could explain the the assumption that it took ten seconds to reverse the switch positions.
     <br/>
     Cut off could have been noticed at any point later than 08:08:42 but before 08:08:52.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  From my reading of the AAIB report, the delay in noticing the cut off switch position could not have been any later than 08:08:47 because the reference to the verbal exchange was written before the reference to the RAT deployment and I assume the written narrative follows the chronological sequence of events.  The delay in resetting those fuel switches might therefore have been no more than 5 seconds.  It is a pity that the pilot making the challenge didn't simply reset the switches to run instead of challenging the other pilot.  I frequently tell people who blow their horns at pedestrians or other motorists that blowing the horn isn't going to help them avoid an accident and that what they really need to do in the limited time available to them is concentrate on applying the brakes and turning the steering wheel.

   Was the RAT deployed manually?

     It suggests to me that the RAT deployment was initiated while the engines were still above idle and generating electrical power. Obviously one of the pilots could have done it via depressing the switch, as it's a "dual engine failure/stall" memory item (see

    <ul>
     <li>
      At no point was gear up commanded (and obviously initiated) ? Did we have a PRC call out ? Assuming they would have commanded gear up does the RAT (plus APU that was also powering up) produce enough hydraulics to perform it ? Assuming so, one might thing it would have given them those few extra seconds they needed for the engine to actually start pushing for real.

      From the satellite pictures and impact points it would seem they could have, by deviating slightly left or right, ended up into a forest / vegetation vs a building. Obviously a very easy call in hindsight but I guess worth mentioning.

  RAT doesn't help retracting the gear. Full conversation hasn't come out. First thing should have been positive rate but it appears engines started winding down as they got airborne so attention shifted to engines.

  SLF: I have a small observation but I'm not sure what it means or if it has any relevance to the accident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Previously I had assumed that the ADS-B data cut out at the same time as power was lost, so I imagined that whatever caused the fairly clear loss of thrust would have happened not too long before. But this report throws a bit of a wrench in my understanding of that.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the report, the fuel cutoff switches transition from RUN to CUTOFF at or very shortly after 08:08:42 UTC. Both engines' N2 values pass below minimum idle speed and the RAT begins supplying hydraulic power at about 08:08:47. Does this not imply that the generators have already been lost? With the APU also being off (the APU inlet door is noted to start opening at 08:08:54), I would have expected ADS-B data to cut out at or before 08:08:47. But curiously FlightRadar24 at least claims to have received data frames from the aircraft until 08:08:51.640970, almost five seconds later and almost ten seconds after the transition to CUTOFF (though the last frame containing coordinates comes at 08:08:50.871005).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Could anyone with relevant experience confirm how long it would take for AC power to be lost in this situation? Also, is it usual/unusual for a preliminary report like this to mention if/when the flight recorder switched to its independent power supply? I imagine it would definitely be in the final report, but I'd hoped it would be easily observable enough to be in this one.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beyond idle curiosity I'm asking because the report
  <i>
   also
  </i>
  says the no. 1 engine's cutoff switch transitioned from CUTOFF to RUN at "about 08:08:52", which oddly coincides with the last ADS-B data frame at 08:08:51.640970, and that seems important somehow. Or more likely I'm just ignorant of some quirk of the 787's electrical system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For reference FR24's CSV containing all ADS-B frames supposedly received from the aircraft can be found in their post here:

     The accident aircraft was written up for a status message of &rdquo;STAB POS XDCR&rdquo; on the previous flight, which is a message relating to implausible data from the stab trim switches. It was released from maintenance (according to the preliminary report) at 06:40UTC ahead of an 07:40UTC departure (the crash flight) with &rdquo;no fault found&rdquo;.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     On the 787-8, as all modern planes, switches are not cabled as dry closing contacts all the way from the switch poles to the affected end devices (FADECs in the case of fuel cutoff switches), but rather connect locally to an analogue/digital converter to encode the switch position data onto the digital comms bus ARINC629 which allows all aircraft systems to talk to one another.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Are the fuel cutoff switches, which are positioned adjacent to the stab trim switches, connected to the same ADC module which produced the error message on the previous flight, which maintenance was unable to resolve before the accident flight took off? I do not know, but it must be worthy of being looked into.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I believe the fuel cutoff switches are one of the exceptions to this. They are direct wired. Stab trim may well be too.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I think they're called remote data concentrators - in many cases it is a conversion from a direct digital input to a bus signal; electronics would not call it an 'analog' input unless it was actually measuring a quantitative value.

     It suggests to me that the RAT deployment was initiated while the engines were still above idle and generating electrical power. Obviously one of the pilots could have done it via depressing the switch, as it's a "dual engine failure/stall" memory item (see

  I think I have seen a previous reference that the generators are disconnected when you select the switches to cutoff (or very shortly afterwards), not when the engine actually drops below idle. That could account for a few seconds of spool down time.

     What is unusual to me is the 4 second gap between moving Eng 1 fuel switch from cutoff to run, and moving Eng 2 fuel switch from cutoff to run.

     One would imagine that in this situation, speed of response would have been critical.

  I don't think this answers my question? Evidently there is an interruption in power, the (quite stable, at that point) ADS-B stream cuts out and doesn't return for the final twenty seconds of flight. And there are other indications that non-essential loads were shed, like the survivor remembering what must have been emergency exit lighting in the cabin. Though I would have liked explicit confirmation of AC power loss happening or not in the report.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The timing of data loss seemingly lining up with the first cutoff switch being flipped back to RUN seems a little too coincidental to me, but again hopefully someone with relevant knowledge has a mundane explanation for this.

     10 seconds to respond is a long long time if you\x92ve just made a silly mistake, you\x92d have those switches back on in a second. The startle factor isn\x92t really a factor here, because you
     <b>
      know
     </b>
     what just happened.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Regardless of what actually happened in that cockpit, reasoning like this seems completely backwards to me. Since when do humans reliably, instantly recognise that they've just made a mistake? If they were
  <i>
   that
  </i>
  attuned to their actions they're almost certainly attuned enough to
  <i>
   not
  </i>
  make the mistake in the first place, especially if we're talking about an action slip. I've e.g. absentmindedly added salt to my tea instead of sugar and I certainly didn't immediately realise that I'd done that - in fact it took a good few seconds even after sipping and spitting it out for my brain to catch up to what must have happened. Even if an observer had pointed out to me before drinking it that my tea had salt in it, I would just have been confused because
  <i>
   obviously
  </i>
  I wouldn't do something that silly (spoiler alert: I did).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On top of that I feel like people are overestimating how long ten seconds actually is, especially considering some of those seconds are reported to have been taken up by confused dialogue (that isn't even reported in its entirety). I thought it was common wisdom that accidents are never down to one thing; it would be light-years from being the first time that suboptimal crew response turned a maybe-recoverable error into a definite disaster without an ounce of malice in the mix.

     RAT doesn't help retracting the gear. Full conversation hasn't come out. First thing should have been positive rate but it appears engines started winding down as they got airborne so attention shifted to engines.

  The fuel control switches were moved to the off position approximately 3 seconds after weight off wheels.

  Loss of hydraulics or electrics will auto deploy the rat. The timing to me however seems to match up with when the engines were selected off.
