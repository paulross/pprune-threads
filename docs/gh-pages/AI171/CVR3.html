  That's an interesting possibility.  The independent power supply for the forward recorder also powers the cockpit area microphone, but not the individual crew mikes, so working out who said what could well be dependent on being able to recognise the voices.

  Up above - apologies I can't find the post... - someone mentioned that the EAFRs
  <i>
   might
  </i>
  send data wirelessly..... Here's the GE "brochure" for the current EAFR (although I am not certain exactly which model would be on the subject aircraft):
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <a href="https://www.geaerospace.com/sites/default/files/enhanced-aircraft-flight-recorder-3254F.pdf" target="_blank">
   https://www.geaerospace.com/sites/de...rder-3254F.pdf
  </a>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  which is an interesting read on what EAFR can and can't (or at least, doesn't) do. It's clear - to me - from that document that wireless data transmission is
  <b>
   <i>
    not
   </i>
  </b>
  a feature of the EAFR. Basically, ethernet cable only. Some data acessible on the aircraft itself, some (CVR in particular) only available when the EAFR is in the lab.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One thing I did not know is:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <i>
   The Image Recorder growth function is used to record visual images of the flight deck instruments, flight deck, the aircraft structures, and engines as required.
  </i>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The final two words of course mean that Air India 787s might, or might not, have that feature enabled. And indeed, it being called a "growth function" probably means "not currently implemented"....

     Absolutely.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     If the aft EAFR ceased recording at the point (just short of the runway end) where the ADS-B and likely everything else went dark, then the extra 30 seconds of CVR recording from the forward recorder could well be crucial to the investigation.

  SLF here. Please excuse some ignorant questions, and please delete if this is simply contributing to the 'noise':
  <br/>
  <br/>
  1) Why would the Aft EAFR stop recording if the main battery were available?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  2) The Aft EAFR has its own dedicated analogue connection from the CAM. Is it the case that other relevant audio streams are not generated and/or transported over the fibre-optic data network to the Aft EAFR when on (main) battery power alone?

    The black box from the Air India flight AI171 that crashed in Ahmedabad on June 12 has been found damaged and may need to be sent to the United States for further data retrieval, according to government sources. Officials indicated that the final decision will rest with the Indian aviation authorities, but the device could be flown to Washington DC for evaluation by the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Technically, the &ldquo;black box&rdquo; includes two crucial components: the Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) and the Flight Data Recorder (FDR). These devices are essential for reconstructing the events leading up to the crash, offering both voice recordings from the cockpit and a detailed record of the aircraft&rsquo;s flight parameters. Due to damage sustained in the crash and fire, India may require the specialized equipment and expertise of the NTSB to recover and interpret the remaining data.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If the device is sent abroad, a team of Indian officials is expected to accompany it to ensure compliance with all security and procedural standards throughout the process.

     Not clear. Is it only the front black box which is badly damaged? The plural "Recorders" may refer to voice and data recorders in the one box.
     <br/>
     And if the rear box does not ave battery back up, then even if undamaged, it may not have all the desired information.

   The forward installed EAFR along with the Cockpit Area Microphone and Preamplifier are typically connected to the Recorder Independent Power Supply (RIPS), providing a backup power source for 10 minutes in the event of power interruptions.

  The rear EAFR doesn't have power backup.  So it will only record data (both CVR and FDR) while it has normal electrical power. At what point before impact that power was lost, we do not know.

     It may be telling that, thus far, nothing has been recommended regarding continued operations of this aircraft type.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  It seems likely (to me) that as of yet, investigators have not discovered anything specific which could point to a need for such a recommendation. My thought would be that they haven't got that far at this time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It may be easy enough to assume (as some have) that the black boxes will have been read and their contents known by now, but much of the physical evidence on the ground is likely too damaged for such ready examination. If, for example, the CVR reveals that the flight deck crew were aware of a failure of both engines, but not a cause, investigators still have a lot of work to do with physical evidence to determine the cause.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Until that is done, or completed sufficiently to create high confidence they are on the right track, surely they can't provide much that would tell airlines or regulators what specific maintenance is advisable.

    The government body investigating the Air India Boeing 787-8 crash in Ahmedabad last week will take a decision on where the black box data will be decoded \x93after due assessment of all technical, safety, and security considerations,\x94 the Ministry of Civil Aviation said on Thursday (June 19, 2025).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The statement said two different sets of black boxes were recovered from the crash site, one on June 13 and another on June 16. Each black box unit comprises the Digital Flight Data Recorder (DFDR) and Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR).

    A government official closely involved with the probe said there would be a preliminary report. Interestingly, during the only other airline crash investigated by the AAIB (which was formed in 2012), after the Mangalore crash of May 2010 \x97 i.e. Calicut accident \x97 only the final report was published within a year.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Officials, past and present, explained that the rules under which the AAIB carries out an investigation do not specify a timeline for a preliminary report, even though the UN aviation safety watchdog, the International Civil Aviation Organisation\x92s Annex 13 requires one within 30 days. A similar rule is not part of the Aircraft (Investigation of Accidents and Incidents) Rules, 2017 formed under the principal law, the Bharatiya Vayuyan Vidheyak, 2024.
    <br/>
    (...)
    <br/>
    One of the above mentioned officials said the Calicut probe team didn\x92t release a preliminary report because the Rules don\x92t lay down a timeline for it and require such a report to only categorise the nature of the mishap. He added that the team involved in the drafting of the Rules held the opinion that such a report could be vastly different from the final investigation report, which may result in public criticism and media backlash.

     1/Would the recorders lose access to aircraft data streams when engine power is lost, at least temporarely making the cockpit area mic recorded by battery power on the front recorder the only source of information ?
     <br/>
     2/The recorders only draw 20W, why is it the front with reserves only for 10 minutes? Can you even buy a battery that small giving 28VDC? Why is such a limited solution selected?
     <br/>
     ( For reference, This battery gives about 9 times that: &lt;url removed&gt; )
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  In reverse order, and the first one being very speculative: The type of battery will likely be highly specific for the usecase, here rugged before anything else. Likely specialized chemistry or one of those hybrid solid state ones. Commonly they trade capacity for other features.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Regarding the recording feature, there's three types of microphone commonly used nowadays: Condenser and Ribbon type are somewhat fragile and require power to record audio while Dynamic type is basically a reverse speaker and is considered rugged. There's an off chance that a Piezzo microphone would be used here as they are basically indestructible but usually reserved for recording while in contact with a large sound transducer. My guess based on that is that we're looking at a dynamic microphone with a run of the mill preamp.
  <br/>
  Depending on the actual electric setup this would yield a handful of different possible installations:
  <br/>
  1) The "Cockpit Area Microphone" (hereby christened CAM because I like abbreviations) is a self contained unit consisting of a Microphone, a preamp and AD converter. This would mean while provided power the digital recording could be passed to either EAFR.
  <br/>
  2) The CAM is a self contained unit consisting of a Microphone and a preamp. This would mean while provided power it could send an analog audio signal to the forward EAFR no problem, but would potentially struggle generating enough of a signal to be picked up by the rear EAFR.
  <br/>
  3) The CAM is just a Microphone. This would mean it requires either no or very little power (even Condenser Mics usually require only Milliwatts) but the signal would be very hard to send over long distances and would require the EAFR to have a preamp.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In general it is audio engineering 101 to place a preamp as close to the source as possible to avoid noise. Thus I would rule out 3. It has both ups and downs to convert the analog signal to a digital signal, and there is a possibility they'd do both. In either case I am confused from an audio engineering standpoint why the rear EAFR would not pickup audio from the CAM if the forward EAFR does. Unless the rear EAFR is fed (audio) data only via BUS, which would be an interesting choice.
  <br/>
  Also keep in mind that historically the CVR was also located in the tail section and very much received an analog signal over the entire distance. There's really no technical reason this wouldn't be possible, I routinely use far longer cables when running audio signals at concerts and those can't use compression because it would dumpster sound quality.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  So, yeah, I don't understand why there would be a mismatch between the recordings of either EAFR, unless there was something else preventing all signal transmission towards the rear EAFR. The CVR in the rear has been a thing for 80 years now.
  <br/>

My guess based on that is that we're looking at a dynamic microphone with a run of the mill preamp.
     <br/>
     Depending on the actual electric setup this would yield a handful of different possible installations:
     <br/>
     1) The "Cockpit Area Microphone" (hereby christened CAM because I like abbreviations) is a self contained unit consisting of a Microphone, a preamp and AD converter. This would mean while provided power the digital recording could be passed to either EAFR.
     <br/>
     2) The CAM is a self contained unit consisting of a Microphone and a preamp. This would mean while provided power it could send an analog audio signal to the forward EAFR no problem, but would potentially struggle generating enough of a signal to be picked up by the rear EAFR.
     <br/>
     3) The CAM is just a Microphone. This would mean it requires either no or very little power (even Condenser Mics usually require only Milliwatts) but the signal would be very hard to send over long distances and would require the EAFR to have a preamp.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     In general it is audio engineering 101 to place a preamp as close to the source as possible to avoid noise. Thus I would rule out 3. It has both ups and downs to convert the analog signal to a digital signal, and there is a possibility they'd do both. In either case I am confused from an audio engineering standpoint why the rear EAFR would not pickup audio from the CAM if the forward EAFR does. Unless the rear EAFR is fed (audio) data only via BUS, which would be an interesting choice.
     <br/>
     Also keep in mind that historically the CVR was also located in the tail section and very much received an analog signal over the entire distance. There's really no technical reason this wouldn't be possible, I routinely use far longer cables when running audio signals at concerts and those can't use compression because it would dumpster sound quality.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     So, yeah, I don't understand why there would be a mismatch between the recordings of either EAFR, unless there was something else preventing all signal transmission towards the rear EAFR. The CVR in the rear has been a thing for 80 years now.
     <br/>
     <br/>

  The recorder data sheet specifies it is an analog input for the area mic, and that it and its pre-amp are powered by the recorder.
  <br/>
  It is likely a mems-type microphone, moving coil, ribbon or traditional condenser microphones aren&rsquo;t really used outside the stage or vintage recording studios these days. But something along these lines:
  <a href="https://pdf.aeroexpo.online/pdf/l3-technologies/dm58-preamplified-digital-microphone/176050-18465.html#open64169" target="_blank">
   https://pdf.aeroexpo.online/pdf/l3-t...html#open64169
  </a>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Note the dual analog and arinc digital outputs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One reason for not doing an analog line all the way to the tail would be weight, as you mention, quality or noise wouldn&rsquo;t be an issue due common mode rejection.

     It is a battery, not a supercapacitor. Most commonly nickel-cadmium, because that chemistry has been used in aircraft for decades. They're safe and readily accepted by regulators. Li-ion can be used, but a "special condition" from the regulators is needed, plus the weight savings would be negligible.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The 10-minute limit has nothing to do with the battery capacity. It's to prevent the recorder from continuing to operate after an accident and thus overwriting the audio of interest. There's a timer in the RIPS module. It will stop providing power after exactly 10 minutes, regardless of state of charge.

  Please note that the EAFR used on the B787 has got at least 2h audio recording for the CVR part as well:

  That question has been asked with some frequency in both threads.
  <br/>
  So far, "unknown" is the correct answer.
  <br/>
  Were there another person, one expects that evidence will be found as the CVR data is deciphered by the investigating team.

     yours is a good and helpful explanation, thank you. Can you please advise what is the trigger that starts the 10 minute period? I guess I mean, what signal tells the battery to stop supplying power 10 minutes from "now". Thanks

  When it stops receiving power from the aircraft. The RIPS sits between aircraft power and the CVR. It pretty much works just like an uninterruptible power supply that you'd use with your PC.

  And the $64k question will be why wasn't the identical unit in the tail section given the same UPS?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It consumes 20.5 watts so a ten minute power supply should not only be easy to integrate but also already exists and is certificated for the forward mounted unit.

  They're not OK if they don't have the information on them that they "should" have had, aka they were stuffed, probably by a major electrical glitch, 4 minutes before the crash itself; they were blank from that point on.

  They are both down the back in the A320 I think. The CVR was damaged and the FDR wasn't found for almost week after because it was blackened/camouflaged by fire, according to the press linked-to on Wiki.

  Actually download of an undamaged recorder can be done using a notebook with an ethernet interface. The EAFR even has an integrated webserver to browse through the recorded data. - At least that\x92s what GE promises.

     With 'intact' being the crucial part of these recent posts. It is my understanding that a suitably equipped LAME can simply download the FDR data from an installed EAFR (CVR requires dismounting). So downloading as such, isn't the issue.

  That aside, I think we're agreed that downloading an intact FDR/EAFR is probably several orders of magnitude easier than one that's been burnt, battered or bruised.
