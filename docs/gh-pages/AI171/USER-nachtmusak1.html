  Hello,
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Would anyone happen to know (or to know where I could find) the drag coefficients of a 787 in various configurations? I've seen some numbers and charts floating around the internet, but I don't know if I can trust them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For context I am trying to plot various possible flight paths (well, essentially ballistic trajectories), in hopes of pinpointing if/when the aircraft lost thrust

  Non-aviation engineer here: I have a question about the low level altitude capture theory that I've been a bit hesitant to ask, since no-one else seemed to be bringing it up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  My understanding of altitude capture is that the autopilot will automatically adjust
  <i>
   both
  </i>
  thrust
  <i>
   and pitch
  </i>
  to intercept the requested altitude. However to my eyes there is very little pitch adjustment in the CCTV video of the plane taken from behind, until the very end of the video when it pitches up somewhat (obscured by buildings, more visible in the smartphone video). Please correct me if I'm wrong but I'd have thought that if the autopilot was trying to capture a very low altitude it would start pitching down (quite noticeably!) to do so, not remain at what looks like 10+ degrees nose-up. I honestly struggle to reconcile what I'm looking at in the video with an attempt to level off at 0ft, 200ft, or any of the other mentioned low-level altitudes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also maybe I'm missing something 787-specific but generally doesn't the autopilot have to be activated for the aircraft to automatically attempt to capture the pre-selected altitude? That was the case in this incident involving a Dash 8 and a target altitude of 0 feet that I am reading about (
  <a href="https://www.gov.uk/aaib-reports/aaib-investigation-to-dhc-8-402-dash-8-g-ecoe" target="_blank">
   https://www.gov.uk/aaib-reports/aaib...-dash-8-g-ecoe
  </a>
  ). I'd have thought the PF would still be hand-flying the departure at the point that things went wrong, considering that the gear hadn't even been retracted yet...

     The autopilot would not have been in and the pilot would have been hand flying maintaining the takeoff attitude. The flight director might have commanded a level off which obviously would not have been followed.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Minimum autopilot engagement altitude is 200\x92 for the 78 (from others on the forum). It\x92s 400\x92 AGL on the 777.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     My interest is in how the auto throttles would have behaved in such a situation\x97where VNAV would not be engaged yet and the automatics gone into SPD/ALT. ; would they have pulled off thrust assuming a level off and then come back in to maintain bug speed (perhaps confusing the crew in the process ?).
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  The Dash 8 doesn't have an autothrottle IIRC, so I wasn't sure what to think about the fact that in the Flybe incident the takeoff and climb were completely normal until the autopilot was engaged. However I thought that an autothrottle on its own (without an autopilot's input) will simply target its given speed or power setting? I am not sure how or why an autothrottle would change its target speed/power uncommanded.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Actually...doesn't the autothrottle normally enter HOLD mode once the aircraft enters the high-speed regime during its takeoff roll? And only re-engages its actual selected mode at 400 feet (or maybe 200 feet?), and in the time in between the crew is supposed to have manual control of thrust? It seems backwards to me that any automated systems would ever override the pilot's requested thrust
  <i>
   on purpose
  </i>
  at such a sensitive stage of flight and I thought that the autothrottle goes into hold for exactly that reason. Coupled with the fact that it would be extremely early in the flight to turn on the autopilot...I'm sure I have a very simplified understanding of how this all works. But I'm struggling to see how - unless the crew had also made some other egregious mistake in their preflight preparations in addition to entering the wrong target altitude - it could go so badly in this specific manner so quickly after lift-off.

     Except that the PF does not immediately get the cue that the power is backing off, because he removed his hand from the power levers at V1. If he sees the Flight Directors indicating down after take off.... of course he will ignore that command and maintain the normal 14deg NU +/- for the expected all-engines climb. However when the speed starts to decay he starts to get the message all is not well and tries to salvage the situation. If the FD goes into altitude capture then the autothrottle becomes speed-on-throttle. Unfortunately the AT logic presumes you are following the FD. If you are now NOT following FD commands then the results become unpredictable. On correct speed but above FCU selected altitude = throttles close.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Just after rotate is a very busy time for your scan. The FMA modes are in the HUD for both pilots to see, however did they have time to read and digest rapidly changing autoflight modes? I have way more experience flying the B744 than the B788 but I can see this happening on either type. How many times were you reminded to RTF FMA!
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  SLF but: I still really don't understand how this is supposed to happen, not merely hypothetically, but congruently with how short and low the flight we can actually see is.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  My understanding (and others have corroborated this) is that in a standard departure the autothrottle is armed and starts the takeoff roll in THR REF mode. It goes into HOLD mode when the IAS passes 80 knots (obviously still on the ground). While it is in HOLD mode, the autothrottle is physically inhibited from moving the thrust levers. It then automatically re-engages at 400ft AGL (though I am not sure how the altitude is measured), and begins to operate as requested by various human and computer systems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If something about my explanation is wrong, please let me know - but if it is correct, then
  <i>
   how
  </i>
  would the autothrottle roll back thrust drastically in what looks like the first few seconds of the flight? I do understand that what you describe is how the autothrottle would behave when it is active, but it sounds to me like it is by design
  <i>
   not
  </i>
  supposed to actually be active during the critical time that we are looking at no matter what automations are armed to be activated once the aircraft is safely away from the ground. Unless the crew did
  <i>
   something
  </i>
  to cause it to engage - and I'm not sure what that would even be. What would they plausibly be doing before even retracting the landing gear?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  My only guess was that depending on how the altitude is measured to determine whether the 400ft gate has been passed (radio altimeter? pressure altitude?), the autothrottle might have come out of HOLD mode (along with VNAV if armed) at a lower altitude than it was supposed to due to some mechanical fault or crew error. But that's already a bigger kettle of fish than just altitude capture...

     At 100 knots during the takeoff roll the systems take a snapshot of the barometric altitude at that point. The 400' for VNAV engagement, if it is armed, is based on that datum.

  Thank you - it doesn't sound like it should be possible for a non-faulty autothrottle to activate below 400 feet then. Even if e.g. the "wrong" starting altitude is measured on the runway (wrong QNH, etc), as long as it is measuring 400 feet from
  <i>
   that
  </i>
  altitude, then it shouldn't matter.

     Reported 625' pressure altitude, elevation 189', QNH 1001.

     <br/>
     So they only got to around 100' height, half the wing span of a Boeing 787? I think it looks higher than that.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Small correction, the 625 ft pressure altitude data point (~100 ft AGL taking temperature, pressure and field elevation into account) is the last received ADS-B data point, which was right around the end of the runway. The aircraft crashed quite a bit further on from that, ~1.5km from the runway end. If you take perspective into account it also appears to continue to climb for a few seconds after passing over the runway end. I think some people in either this thread or the first thread have argued that the ADS-B data cutting out could be indicative of power loss (like with the Jeju Air 2216 accident) and not just spotty coverage, and when I looked at other flights I was inclined to agree - coverage is spotty on the apron and runway, but once planes start climbing the updates become consistent. If that really is when the engines died, ballistics suggests that the aircraft could well attain another 100 - 200 feet off its sheer momentum before the inevitable descent.

  Re: mayday call transmission, isn't that easily battery powered? At least on the captain's side.

  Sorry, maybe the context was lost - I was responding to a theory that did argue that the aircraft was automatically trying to capture a target altitude that was incorrectly set too low. That
  <i>
   has
  </i>
  happened before, but the incidents I could find looked very different from this one (one Dash 8 and one A330, both involved the crew activating the autopilot).

     Can someone help me with the calculations on how far from the point of our last ADS-B readout we can expect the stricken jet to fly/glide?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I am assuming the take off mass around 190-200 tons with 50 tons of fuel. For the glide phase this is of no importance, however.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Data on the Internet puts the glide ratio of a 789 around 18-21:1. Gear and flaps/slats out should have a significant negative effect. Does anyone have a good take how much? Minus 40%?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     From the available data we can infer the plane never was higher than 200\x92 AAL, maybe even 100\x92. If I understood the online sources correctly, the point of impact was only about 20\x92 lower than the average runway level.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     If I am not mistaken the distance from the last ADS-B point to the impact site is about 2 km as per Reuters and the Guardian. That would put it at 6,500\x92.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I just can\x92t get these numbers over each other without the aircraft producing thrust. Please help me correcting the numbers.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I can't speak to the glide ratio but the other numbers are rather off.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For example the distance between the last received ADS-B point (23.066541\xb0N, 72.623189\xb0E) and the impact site (23.055547\xb0N ,72.612406\xb0E) comes out to 1.6467km (~5403 ft) using the Haversine formula. That's significantly less than 2km (~6562 ft).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The aircraft also keeps climbing past the last received ADS-B data point, and visibly attains more than both 100 ft and 200 ft in height above the ground (easily judged by the wingspan of 197 ft), though not by much in the latter case.

     That\x92s what got me headed down the low altitude capture route. While the mind does really strange things post traumatic event \x97 and memory and recollection are greatly affected by it \x97 if true it means that thrust was lost but the engines stayed lit.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     There may have been other electrical and systems malfunctioning. But if whatever happened, let\x92s say the auto throttle simply pulled power to idle \x97or a low power setting\x97at a critical time. Perhaps on its own perhaps with other systems failures.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     We like to think it basic that we\x92d slam the throttles forward. Right away.

     <br/>
     <br/>
     And neither did Air Florida years ago.

   </div>
  </div>
  How does a non-faulty autothrottle pull power to idle at the critical time we are witnessing (i.e. just before or just after takeoff)?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I don't mean to keep asking this, but I still haven't gotten an answer. Unless the allegation is that the crew did not arm the autothrottle properly, it just doesn't make sense to me.

     An auththrottle malfunction makes as much sense as anything else at this point.  But even if not I wonder if the low altitude capture scenario would dramatically pull off power initially assuming the aircraft was going to level off before restoring it as the aircraft slowed down.  Didn`t fly the 78 but on the 777 the auththrottles were laggy sometimes.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I am specifically asking about the case without a malfunction because my understanding is that the autothrottle
  <b>
   explicitly
  </b>
  does not affect thrust between passing 80 knots on the runway and passing 400 ft AGL.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Neither does (or should?) any autopilot mode (except LNAV? at 50 feet?) be active under 400 feet. Armed yes but not actually engaged.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  So how would either of these things have any effect on an aircraft that's just lifting off unless they're faulty? Everything I can turn up seems
  <i>
   very
  </i>
  clear that the autothrottle, VNAV, etc only engage at 400 feet AGL on departure. In fact, both altitude capture incidents I've been able to turn up were only triggered when the autopilot was engaged. Why would any pilot be engaging the autopilot bare seconds after lift-off?

     As has been gone over before, the auththrottles normally stay in HOLD until 400 AGL at which point they engage in THR REF xxx VNAV SPD to whatever value was programmed in the RTOW.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     BUT
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Say the MCP is mis-set to 200\x92 or so. VNAV never engages and the expected mode (from others; I`ve never tried it) would be SPD xxx ALT.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The modes still engage regardless of whether or not the airplane is on autopilot; the autopilot itself just follows the flight director commands (and the PF certainly woudn`t follow the FD in this case). Autothrottles are independent of autopilot.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  To be clear, are you stating categorically or guessing (or neither, and I'm misreading you and you mean something else) that the 787's autothrottle will come
  <i>
   out of HOLD
  </i>
  and into SPD mode
  <i>
   below 400 feet
  </i>
  by design in response to the altitude that's set in the mode control panel, entirely by itself, without the autopilot engaged? Not that this is the way it would behave in normal flight - that this is the way it is
  <b>
   designed
  </b>
  to behave while it's in HOLD mode for takeoff?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I am actually looking for an answer from a pilot (or at least someone with an FCOM who can share any relevant passages) because nothing I have been able to look up on my own suggests that this is the case. All secondary sources I can find just say that the autothrottle is inhibited under 400 feet on takeoff, with my impression being that the crew is expected to manage thrust manually during that phase of flight. The incidents I was able to turn up involving an aircraft attempting to capture a target altitude
  <i>
   at takeoff specifically
  </i>
  don't help either:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - G-ECOE: Flight was completely normal until the crew engaged the autopilot at 1350 feet, at which point the aircraft started diving to the target of 0 feet. However it involved a Dash 8 and not only is that not a Boeing aircraft, it doesn't have an autothrottle to begin with. Nothing to conclude from this.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - F-WWKH: Again automated deviation was triggered by the crew engaging the autopilot a few seconds after takeoff as part of a test flight. However again also not a Boeing aircraft (an A330) and the selected target altitude was 2000 feet so the autopilot tried to pitch up to capture it. Not sure if anything can be concluded from this.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - A6-EQI: The most relevant, being a Boeing 777, with wide speculation being that the selected altitude was left at 0 feet. However the preliminary report is very thin so there's little to go on in the way of factual information,
  <i>
   but
  </i>
  the problem seems to entirely have been that the pilot flying was following the flight directors without question. There's zero indication of any loss of thrust, in fact they seem to have nearly entered an overspeed condition partly due to the shallow climb angle implying that the engines were doing just fine. So it doesn't seem like the selected altitude caused the autothrottle to do anything.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I am sorry if it seems like I'm banging on about this autothrottle point a bit much but as an engineer it just seems completely backwards to me. What exactly is the point of the HOLD mode or of setting those specific gates (80 knots, 400 feet) if the autothrottle can so easily come out of it? The design might as well not have it at all and just leave the autothrottle in THR REF for takeoff then - what would be the difference?

     The autopilot would NOT be engaged below 400\x92 (or 200\x92 in the 78\x96although I doubt anyone engages it that low). The autopilot and autothrottles are separate systems but do interact. The autothrottles typically WOULD be engaged from the start of the takeoff roll; using the TOGA levers to set takeoff thrust).
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I am guessing because although I flew the 777 I never tried a low altitude capture before VNAV engaged \x97 and it`s been a few years). But think it probably would. As one goes through 50\x92 LNAV engages; VNAV is normally armed prior to the EFIS check if it`s to be used (which it usually is). So in this scenario LNAV would have been engaged but since VNAV is armed but never engages my guess is that the automatics would engage in SPD/LVAV/ALT. I could be wrong. The PF would have been hand flying (and obviously not following the flight director with autothrottles engaged.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     HOLD is present in many other regimes of flight; all it means is that the auththrottle (right now) is not controlling the throttles and they stay where they are\x97and the PF can move them if desired at will. Fr` instance, when descending in FLCH or even VNAV SPD the throttles will usually be in HOLD. (To me this usually meant `hold` the throttles\x97and tweek them in descent as required). Thrust can be modulated to adjust rate of descent (the throttles become vertical speed levers). On altitude capture in the case of FLCH or path capture in the case of VNAV SPD (in descent) the auththrottles kick in and it becomes SPD/xxx/ALT (or VPTH or VALT as the case might be).
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Most everyone knew the autothrottles would not engage below 400` and that FLCH in descent at very low altitudes was not an appropriate mode \x97 and they did not activate providing low speed protection in the case of Asiana.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     But at this point it`s a guess because I never did it (MCP set at low altitude on takeoff with VNAV never engaging). Perhaps someone else has.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I suppose an informed guess is the best answer I can get here, short of someone having access to an actual sim or a Boeing engineer chipping in. Though I am curious that you are guessing that it
  <i>
   would
  </i>
  engage, when in the example you give to point out the autothrottle being inhibited at low altitudes (the Asiana accident at SFO) the autothrottle
  <i>
   didn't
  </i>
  engage - not even to provide low speed protection, a potentially life-and-death matter. If that accident was my only datapoint my guess would be that if it's strict enough to not engage for stall protection, it's strict enough to not engage for altitude capture.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also to be clear I do know that the autopilot and autothrottle are independent - I have been talking about the autopilot because as I listed, in the incidents I could find where the aircraft automatically tried to capture a target altitude on takeoff, the autopilot was first engaged. So my impression was that until then the aircraft might provide guidance (like in the Emirates case) but will not actually do anything to change the thrust, pitch, etc parameters that have been set.

     Not knowledgeable to know about a lot of this myself but interested in views. His calculation asserts that it was not a dual engine flameout to cover the distance it did but there must have been at least some thrust provided to do so.

  Disclaimer: I'm not a pilot, only a non-aviation engineer, and so I'm a bit hesitant to criticise this. And yet:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The determination of the height AGL seems quite incorrect - it completely ignores the local pressure and temperature, which very much need to be corrected for. Applying those corrections even using rough rules of thumb (~30 ft per mbar, ~4 feet per \xb0C per 1000 ft) gives a figure that's around ~100 feet AGL. The follow-up sanity check also fails even without knowing the correct math because if you match the ADS-B data (timestamp + location) to when &amp; where the aircraft lifts off and starts to climb in the CCTV video (versus just assuming that the peak height seen in the video matches the last ADS-B data point), the aircraft is very much not 300 feet above the ground when its transponder reports an altitude of 625 feet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also the estimation of the glide ratio with flaps 5, gear and the RAT deployed being 3.5 to 1 seemed incredibly low to me, but I'm the first to admit that I have nowhere near as much knowledge of gliding performance as I do of weather math. So I looked up the closest incident I could think of: Air Transat 236, an A330-200 (so of a pretty similar shape, wingspan and wing area as a 787). According to the final report (link:
  <a href="https://www.fss.aero/accident-reports/dvdfiles/PT/2001-08-24-PT.pdf" target="_blank">
   https://www.fss.aero/accident-report...1-08-24-PT.pdf
  </a>
  ), the aircraft arrived at a fix approximately 8 nautical miles (48609 ft) from the runway at an altitude of approximately 13000 ft, at which point the crew decided to execute a 360 turn to lose altitude as well as to extend the slats and landing gear during the turn (the RAT of course had already long been deployed at this point), both to prepare for landing and to help further lose altitude. Sure there's some rounding here, and my understanding is that "flaps 1" on Airbus aircraft deploys only leading edge and not trailing edge devices, but this already suggests that their expected glide ratio was significantly higher than the raw 48609:13000 ratio (~3.74:1).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They re-established themselves on final in their landing configuration at an altitude of ~8000 feet and a distance of 9 nautical miles (54685 ft), so let's say that the true distance was somewhere between 8 NM and 9 NM to account for rounding. That gives a glide ratio of between ~6:1 and ~6.83:1. But on top of that, the crew
  <i>
   still
  </i>
  had to execute a series of S-turns to lose enough altitude to actually make the runway, so their "dirty" glide ratio must have been
  <i>
   even higher
  </i>
  than that. Unfortunately I don't think it's possible to determine conclusively what the ratio was since we don't know how many track miles were added on by the turns (the flight data recorder stopped when the engines flamed out and human testimony only goes so far), and again they did not have flaps extended, but I think it's fair to say that a glide ratio of 3.5:1 is a wildly low estimate for an airliner of the 787's calibre even with the gear down.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sorry if this is off-topic or too much rambling, but considering how much speculation there tends to be both in this thread and elsewhere about real-world glide performance (especially in non-ideal configurations), hopefully these details are helpful.

     This is my latest attempt to square the circle using all the data points and minimal assumptions. The main shortcoming of the analysis is not knowing the maximum L/D and the speed for maximum LD with the gear down, flaps 5, and the RAT extended. However, if I use a reasonable number in my opinion for the L/D in that configuration and assume that the airplane is being flown at the speed for it, it will not get to the crash site. The distance from the runway of the crash site is from a previous graphic (1.55 km); the rotation point from fdr, permalink 314; 200 feet max height above the runway being generally accepted; crash site 50 feet below the runway elevation cited previously. An average speed of 180 knots is consistent with the dimensions given and 30 seconds flight time. A flare at 50 feet will briefly increase the L/D to 20, maybe even 30 (500 feet more than shown) but still not enough to make up the shortfall, In fact, with a head wind the L/D will be lower than assumed as well as if the speed being flown is higher or lower than required for maximum L/D in that configuration. In other words, there must have been some thrust available.

  There is easily-correctable available data with the aircraft's altitude at pretty much the end of the runway and it is not at 200 feet (it's around 100\xb112.5 feet).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As the aircraft visibly continues to climb past that height (and for a longer period than ADS-B data covers, if the camera's perspective casts doubt on that), it seems rather clear to me that it reached its peak height past the end of the runway.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In light of this I find the fact that people keep calculating a glide
  <i>
   from the runway
  </i>
  to the crash site to be a bit strange. Wouldn't the first step of any math be to try to determine
  <i>
   where
  </i>
  it started descending?
