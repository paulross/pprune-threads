     Although the gear bogie isn\x92t in the initial post-liftoff position, if you can see the retraction mechanism operating in a 787 It first tilts the bogie forward. I\x92d therefore consider that a \x93gear up\x94 switch was activated but the action failed \x97most likely due to hydraulic pressure loss. In the second video (left-side view), I could interpret that gear retraction begins around 24 s and then halts before 27 s, exactly when the aircraft stops climbing.

  Thank you, and to HI288 too! this combined with the FR24 blog post about adsb loss just over the runway threshold, and the latest DGCA ask for Air India 787 maintenance adds more weight to the theory, IMO, that there was a major technical issue in play here.

     Firstly, I don\x92t think an inadvertent selection of flaps up caused this accident. I think it\x92s a red herring that seemed plausible initially but it is not consistent with the RAT being deployed, and the evidence for the RAT is strong.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     To answer your broader question though, how could such an error happen? It happens because us simple humans learn how to do actions to the point where we don\x92t have to think about them anymore. This allows us to effectively automate routine tasks and save our brains for more novel tasks. The problem arises when we trigger the wrong automatic action in response to a cue. You ask for gear up, I know I need to select the gear up, I know where the gear handle is and what it looks and feels like, yet something goes wrong in the wiring of my body and instead, the flap-up automatic action is run. It\x92s run before I have consciously thought about it.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Sound far fetched? Well it has happened numerous times. I\x92ve seen someone do exactly that, select the flap instead of the gear, and there are incident reports publicly available. All modern passenger jets have a similar layout of the flap lever and the gear lever with the gear looking like a wheel and the flap looking like a wing, yet this error can still happen.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Have you ever gone to put something in the fridge that should\x92ve been put in the cupboard? I\x92d bet that most people have made that weird error at some point in their lives, and yet the fridge doesn\x92t look like the cupboard and they\x92re nowhere near each other.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Neurotypically an error in an automatic action will occur when the routine that encompasses that action is changed. Hence babies being left in back seats of cars, and probably a factor for the sterile flight deck rule. Any reason to think that might have been in play here?

  SLF, so probably stupid question: Why don't companys like Airbus or Boeing integrate scales in their planes? Not to make calculation of lift of weight of calculations are wrong? Why don't they integrate systems that hinder you from retracting flaps in the first 20 to 30 seconds after the landing gear lost contact to the ground etc?

  It's tempting to think that, however one may also have made the case 'why doesn't Boeing install a system that prevents the nose getting too high on the 737 MAX? Then they won't have to retrain crews on handling differences'. We know how that worked out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When designing anything you need to account for unintended consequences and the possibilities for that system adversely affecting safety if it were to malfunction. If you introduced a system designed to prevent flap retraction 20 to 30s after liftoff, what if failure in a channel of that system then prevents flap retraction required to achieve a MACG with critical terrain on departure. We could 'why don't they do this / why don't they do that' until eventually we end up with not flying at all.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On your point of integrated scales, there is a far easier way to cross check actual aicraft weight with calculated weight: a computer that cross references acceleration data on the takeoff run with known values from lookup tables based on specific environmental conditions and engine thrust settings. If you're not accelerating at a normal rate expected for the calculated thrust and weight a warning can be triggered. This was a recommendation echoed by the AAIB following the incident with a Jet2 aircraft getting airborne at only 70% thrust. I believe Airbus and Boeing are looking into the potential implementation of such a safety system.

     We're all shouting each other down with two main different theories on why the aircraft lost lift so shortly after takeoff.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     1) Incorrect flap retraction causing the aircraft to lose lift and unable to recover the energy in time. (Not unheard of and plenty of reports where this has happened - albeit usually not to a crash).
     <br/>
     <br/>
     2) Loss of engine thrust backed up two potential pieces of evidence that back up the RAT was deployed (apparent RAT sound, potential RAT seen on low res video).
     <br/>
     <br/>
     It is impossible to know which of these is the case. Considering this summary of memory items is there the potential for a combination of both theories to have taken place?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Inadvertant flap retraction by PNF leading the PF to sense a sink and loss of lift. Pushes the thrust levers forward to the firewall and still the aircraft sinks. PF looking through the HUD and so very much 'outside focused' and doesn't realise that PNF has instead moved the flaps. PF defaults to memory items for loss of thrust on both engines before PNF can realise or communicate to PF what they've done, start switches are cut off which drops the RAT and from that point they're only heading one way. This would satisfy the strongly held belief that the RAT was extended, whilst also following the more likely initial cause of an action slip by PNF starting the sequence, rather than a dual engine failure.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Why the need to make the two theories fit in such a convoluted manner? Inadvertent flap retraction was theorised because people assumed that was most likely to have caused the loss of lift - hardly anyone believed dual engine failure was possible. Now we know that the loss of lift was indeed almost certainly caused by a loss of engine power, why all these awkward attempts to reverse engineer it to still fit the flap retraction theory? People need to realise they are only trying to make the flap retraction theory fit because of cognitive biases. If we had all been told immediately, there was dual power loss and the RAT deployed, no-one would even be considering flaps. Its confirmation bias of past assumptions, that's all.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As has been said many times as well, the landing gear retraction process appears to start as the bogies tilt, and then suddenly stops. Which rather suggests they did pull the gear lever. Based on the videos and the amount of speed the plane lost in the very brief sequence ovents, I'd say that the plane lost power a lot earlier than it would have in your theory.

  The difficulty is making the sensors and control systems reliable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Your simple logics can make the situation worse in failure modes. E.g. someone mentioned MCAS, simple simple logic that fixed a minor problem but brought down two airplanes when the sensors failed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other examples: there was an A340 into Quito (?) a while back that landed hard, breaking the WOW sensors. Interlocks wouldn\x92t let ground spoilers, reversers, etc deploy. Aircraft unable to stop, went off the end with fatalities.  Yet those interlocks do save lives in other situations, eg AC DC8 crash in Malton in the 1960s.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Simple sounding systems are not nearly as simple as imagined. Design engineers have to work out every conceivable combination of faults/failures and what would happen. Fixing one situation often opens up another one.

     In fairness, recalling a "green light" is a pretty specific thing. A "sensation of thrust" from a seated passenger who may not even be an experienced flyer could be describing any feeling of movement or the illusion of same.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  In the spirit of fairness there is another sensation that can be interpreted as "increased thrust" that a passenger is equally if not more likely to be talking about

  : a change in [perceived] engine noise level and/or quality.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Personally I don't hear much of the engines as the plane moves away from the cameraperson in the phone video, while the sound of impact is clearly discernible. If anyone can hear the engines well enough to tell if there is a significant change in their tone or volume, that would be valuable info, I think. Alternatively whatever increase in noise was heard started before the recording starts. In that case I suppose the "RAT theorists" would say it was the droning of the now-deployed RAT, with the assumption that it would be audible from inside the cabin (things like flap and landing gear actuation certainly are, so that isn't all that far-fetched). On the other hand, the "flap theorists" would probably say it was the crew firewalling the thrust levers in response to the inability to climb, which isn't far-fetched either.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Either way we will know soon enough what actions the pilots did or didn't take, since the various flight recorders should be found fairly easily in good condition.

  Good summary, I'd just say the thrust levers definitely weren't firewalled. The plane lost a huge amount of speed by impact. This single fact should be enough to end the flap retraction theory. It lost a huge amount of speed while descending - now what might cause that? The gear also begin the retraction process (bogies tilting). The obsession with flaps when there isn't a single piece of evidence for it is very odd. (not suggesting you are guilty of it btw).

     Retracting the flaps would put them at the back of the power curve where drag increases with decreasing speed, causing the speed to reduce further!
     <br/>
     The trouble seems to start at the exact moment the gear should have been raised, putting the flaps up, iso the gear, would cause the kind of loss of lift you see in the video. From there on, being at the back of the power curve, only firewalling the thrust levers and extending the flaps again could have saved them.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Yes indeed, the moment they pulled the gear lever, as we see the gear begin the retraction process, and then suddenly stop. Almost as if they suddenly lost power.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  We can see the landing gear retraction process begin. We see the bogies tilted in the second video. We can hear the RAT. We can see the RAT. We can see the flaps extended in the video and at the crash site. There isn't actually a single piece of evidence the flaps were raised, it's just a conclusion people jumped too before evidence began to emerge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The crazy thing is, when the report comes out and there is no mention of flaps none of the people who have been pushing the flap theory will self reflect or learn anything. They'll think those of us who didn't buy into it were just lucky, rather than it being down to use of fairly simple critical thinking.

      At this stage, at least two scenarios seem highly plausible:
     </b>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <b>
      1. Technical issue
     </b>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Airliners rely on
     <i>
      air/ground logic
     </i>
     , which is fundamental to how systems operate.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     There have been numerous crashes and serious incidents linked to this logic functioning incorrectly.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Some engineering tests require the air/ground switch to be set in a particular mode. If it's inadvertently left in engineering mode&mdash;or if the system misinterprets the mode&mdash;this can cause significant problems.
     <ul>
      <li>
       <b>
        On the ground
       </b>
       , if the aircraft is incorrectly in
       <i>
        air mode
       </i>
       , some systems may be unavailable&mdash;such as wheel brakes, reverse thrust, or ground spoilers.
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       <b>
        In the air
       </b>
       , if the aircraft is mistakenly in
       <i>
        ground mode
       </i>
       , flaps might auto-retract, and various layers of system protection may be disabled.
       <br/>
      </li>
     </ul>
     In the case of the ANA 787, it appears the engine shutdown occurred during the landing roll, possibly when the TCMA system activated.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <b>
      2. Pilot misselection of fuel control switches to cutoff
     </b>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     This is still a very real possibility. If it occurred, the pilot responsible may not have done it consciously&mdash;his mindset could have been in a different mode.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     There&rsquo;s precedent: an A320 pilot once inadvertently shut down both engines over Paris. Fortunately, the crew managed to restart them. Afterward, the pilot reportedly couldn&rsquo;t explain his actions.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     If something similar happened here, then when the pilots realized the engines had stopped producing thrust, pushing the levers forward would have had no effect. It&rsquo;s easy to overlook that the fuel switches are in the wrong position&mdash;they're far from the normal scan pattern. And with the ground rushing up, the view outside would&rsquo;ve been far more commanding.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Speaking personally, when I shut down engines at the end of a flight, I consciously force myself to operate each fuel switch
     <i>
      independently
     </i>
     and with full attention. I avoid building muscle memory that might lead to switching off both engines in a fast, well-practiced habit.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     If this is a technical issue, I assume we&rsquo;ll know soon enough.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  On item 1, the TCMA issue should have been fixed, it does fit the sort of issue that occurred here. TDRACER can talk to that, and has done in 2019 and again in post 792. As to flap auto retraction, the B787 like all Boeings has a gated flap lever, and the flaps are only able to move independent of the lever by flap load relief. That would not have caused a loss of thrust, and in this case it is evident that the event is a thrust loss not a CL loss.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On item 2, the video shows no asymmetry at any time, so there is only a symmetric failure of the engines possible. Back on a B747 classic, you could chop all 4 engines at the same time with one hand, on a B737, also, not so much on a B777 or B787. I would doubt that anyone used two hands to cut the fuel at screen height. Note, there was a B744 that lost one engine in cruise when a clip board fell off the coaming. Didn't happen twice, and it only happened to one engine.

  Neila83 is correct, the gear tilt pre retraction is rear wheels low, and at the commencement of the selection of the retraction cycle (generally),
  <strike>
   the first thing that happens is the inboard MLG doors start to open below the wheel well and then the bogie is driven to front wheels low.
  </strike>
  (There is also an option that the inboard gear doors start to open early as a result of WOW sensing to improve the SSL climb limit). [my bad, for the B788 Capt Bloggs informs us the gear door sequence is after the tilt, not before, the B789 has the before tilt, the option for the door open at rotate is separate]
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <strike>
   The inboard doors do not appear to have opened in this case, yet, the gear is forward wheels down. This appears to be out of sequence. TD may have better knowledge on the options that exist with the B788, but this is not looking good at this time.
  </strike>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There is enough in the way of anomalies here to end up with regulatory action, and airlines themselves should/will be starting to pore over their systems and decide if they are comfortable with the airworthiness of the aircraft at this moment. A latent single point of failure is not a comfortable place to be. Inhibiting TCMA might be a good interim option, that system could have been negated by having the
  <b>
   ATR ARM switches....(Both)... ARM
  </b>
  deferred to the before takeoff checks. The EAFR recovery should result in action within the next 24-48 hours. Boeing needs to be getting their tiger teams warmed up, they can ill afford to have a latent system fault discovered that is not immediately responded to, and the general corporate response of
  <i>
   "blame the pilots"
  </i>
  is not likely to win any future orders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I think we are about to have some really busy days for the OEM.

     I've been closely examining a video frame captured very early in the footage depicting the aircraft's final moments. In this particular frame, I believe the
     <b>
      left main landing gear (MLG) door is clearly visible in the open position
     </b>
     , while the
     <b>
      right MLG door appears closed
     </b>
     . Additionally, both
     <b>
      main gear bogies are noticeably tilted forward
     </b>
     \x97 a configuration that typically occurs at the initiation of the gear retraction sequence.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     This combination strongly suggests that a
     <b>
      gear retraction was commanded
     </b>
     , but the
     <b>
      sequence was interrupted and never completed
     </b>
     . What\x92s particularly striking is the
     <b>
      asymmetry
     </b>
     \x97 the left door open, the right door closed \x97 which should not occur during normal operations and points toward a possible
     <b>
      hydraulic failure scenario
     </b>
     during retraction.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     As many will know, on the Boeing 787-8,
     <b>
      each main gear door is hydraulically actuated and powered by its respective side\x92s hydraulic system
     </b>
     \x97 the
     <b>
      left gear door by the left hydraulic system
     </b>
     , and the
     <b>
      right by the right
     </b>
     . This leads me to propose the following hypothesis:
     <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
      <li>
       Shortly after rotation, with a positive rate of climb established, the
       <b>
        flight crew commands gear up
       </b>
       .
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       The
       <b>
        gear retraction sequence initiates
       </b>
       ; the
       <b>
        main gear bogies tilt forward
       </b>
       , consistent with the start of retraction.
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       <b>
        The right engine fails first
       </b>
       , resulting in a
       <b>
        loss of right hydraulic system pressure
       </b>
       . Consequently, the
       <b>
        right MLG door does not open
       </b>
       .
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       The
       <b>
        left MLG door, still powered by the left hydraulic system, opens
       </b>
       .
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       <b>
        Moments later, the left engine also fails
       </b>
       , leading to
       <b>
        loss of the left hydraulic system
       </b>
       . With the door now open but no remaining hydraulic pressure,
       <b>
        the left main gear remains extended and the door remains open
       </b>
       .
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       The
       <b>
        ram air turbine (RAT) deploys
       </b>
       , consistent with total engine and electrical power loss.
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       With the
       <b>
        loss of thrust from both engines
       </b>
       , the aircraft loses lift and enters an unrecoverable descent, tragically ending in impact.
       <br/>
      </li>
     </ol>
     This sequence would explain the
     <b>
      partially completed gear retraction
     </b>
     and the
     <b>
      asymmetric gear door position
     </b>
     observed in the video evidence. It\x92s worth noting that the timing of the hydraulic losses would have to be
     <b>
      very close together
     </b>
     \x97 potentially within seconds \x97 which aligns with a
     <b>
      dual engine failure shortly after take-off
     </b>
     . In such a scenario,
     <b>
      asymmetric thrust would be minimal or non-existent
     </b>
     , making the aircraft\x92s attitude appear otherwise stable in its descent.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Further supporting this theory are:
     <ul>
      <li>
       <b>
        Eyewitness reports of a loud bang
       </b>
       , possibly indicating an engine failure.
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       A
       <b>
        mayday call
       </b>
       reportedly made by the crew.
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       The
       <b>
        audible presence of the RAT
       </b>
       in the video, suggesting a complete loss of engine-driven electrical and hydraulic systems.
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       The
       <b>
        noticeable absence of typical engine noise
       </b>
       , supporting the hypothesis of dual engine failure.
       <br/>
      </li>
     </ul>
     This scenario would offer a tragically plausible explanation for the aircraft\x92s behavior and the observed configuration in its final moments. Of course, the
     <b>
      official investigation will provide the definitive answers
     </b>
     , and we must await their findings.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     In the meantime, my thoughts are very much with all those affected by this heartbreaking event.
     <br/>
     <br/>

      NOTE:
     </b>
     Unfortunately this is my first post here. I wanted to upload the frame for all to see but the forum is restricting me from doing this until I reach 8 posts. I can't link to it via a URL either. I studied a frame from the very start of the video, just as the full aircraft enters view and expanded it by 400% allowing me to see the position of the MLG doors).
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I have no knowledge about 787, but every landing gear system I\x92ve worked with did not sequence Left and Right MLG to retract and extend with each other. In fact it is typical for left and right side to move at slightly different speed due to different friction etc. Retraction assymmetry is probably not a clue to this mystery.

     Interested observer here, nothing more; with a question:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     If the mayday call has been reported correctly, it states: \x91Mayday! No thrust. Losing power. Cannot lift.\x92
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Is the term \x91Cannot lift\x92 standard comms for lack of climb rate/stall? If not, it strikes me that the transcript is incomplete, either due to loss of comms, inaudibility, or even just bad reporting.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     \x91Cannot lift gear\x92?
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Perhaps the phrase \x93Losing power\x93 refers to electrical power so following your line of thought the mayday call might be an accurate description of what they are experiencing I.e. no thrust, failing electrics and can\x92t raise the landing gear.

  The post you are replying to is completely wrong.
  <br/>
  The 787 landing gear is operated by the centre hydraulic system's two electric pumps.

     As many will know, on the Boeing 787-8,

  The 787 landing gear extension/retraction system (which includes the gear doors) is operated by Centre Hydraulics only, with a backup / alternate gear

  system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Centre Hydraulic system is powered by two Electric Motor Pumps.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Obviously, the two Centre pumps are ultimately powered by electrical power from the VFSGs on the engines and/or the APU.

  Note: the RAT will not (and could not!) supply hydraulic power to the gear system.

     Speaking of invalid derate, I sort of recall reading about an incident with a very heavy aircraft and some kind of mistake or fault (or maybe both?) leading to insufficient takeoff thrust on a hot day. Fortunately the crew was able to stabilise the aircraft and return safely to the airport, but unfortunately I don't remember any more details, and so finding it has been difficult.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Might that incident shed any light on this one, especially since that crew
     <i>
      was
     </i>
     able to recover?
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  <br/>
  Are you thinking of the EK A340 that departed with a 100 ton descepancy entered in the box resulting in incorrect thrust derate and under cooked V speeds? That aircraft was saved by the flight crew that fire walled the thrust leavers with about 600M remaining. Tail strike and destroyed the LOC antenta, but was able to get Airbourne then return for landing at YMML. Is this a possibility? 100 ton gross error, resulting in incorrect thrust, speeds and flap setting? Pilot mistakes lack of thrust for partial engine failure? The confusion and startle factor as the aircraft is rotating with a surprising lack of thrust and the runway end fast approaching may account for the gear not being selected up. If there were a gross error in the weight entered in the FMC, no takeoff config warning. 40 degrees C, flaps 5 instead of flaps 15 or similar? Hopefully some initial data from the FDR may be a pretty good indication.

  Hard to imagine if that mistake was made he\x92d get on the radio saying engines losing power with out pushing levers up first ? What ever happened had  guy in left seat stunned ? My opinion only , if he was a training Capt he , like most guys in the left keep a good watch on where hands go . If an incorrect weight, chances are he\x92d know on runway and thrust to TOGA , those engines appear to be along way off producing thrust . If flap was raised by mistake , flap can be lowered just as quick . He\x92d not be on radio saying thrust decreasing while looking at flap up . If miss set alt hold he\x92d be calling modes and selecting higher altitude and changing  climb mode thinking he\x92s got to remember to write a report on arrival . If engines turned off deliberately!! Big If , no need for radio calls , turn engines back on and protect them and try isolating flight controls, if possible .
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If RAT out ??? That tells a lot .
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Not long to wait now ?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  condolences to family\x92s and loved ones !

     Many thanks. It still is a concern that the tilt has occurred but no doors have opened.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I have seen in manuals for other airliners that because the bogie tilt is by a hydraulic actuator, gravity deploying the gear means the gear doesn't tilt to landing position.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With the loss of centre-system pressure*, would you expect the bogies to tilt naturally? I.e. spring pressure holds the gear in the stowed tilt, a hydraulic cylinder pushes the gear to the landing tilt. No pressure means the gear returns to the 'stowed' tilt.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The tilt actuator is designed to be overridden when the bogie hits the ground, so perhaps it has some kind of intentional bypass and doesn't stay in place without continually applied hydraulic pressure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If so, that would also point towards total loss of electrics and no attempt to raise the gear.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  * 787 centre system is powered by two electric pumps, plus the RAT. The RAT hydraulic pump only powers flight controls, not the landing gear.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <b>
   Electric loss:
  </b>
  <br/>
  Surely even total AC power loss shouldn't result in engine loss, even if the RAT doesn't come online. The FADECs have their own alternators, bare minimum flight control computers and actuators are available on battery (though probably result in some equivalent of Direct Law), and boost pumps are unnecessary at low altitude. Left/right EDPs will remain active if the engines are running at any serious speed; providing flight controls.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Poor crew reaction to ending up in direct law is possible but it's hard to see the electrical issues as a cause, not a symptom.
