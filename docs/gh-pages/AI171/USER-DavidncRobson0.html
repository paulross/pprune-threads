   Flaps Retracted Instead of MLG

 <div id="post_message_11902254">
  My initial thoughts were the same as yours that the flaps were retracted instead of the MLG. I therefore surmised that the PF instructed the PNF to retract the MLG after take off and that because his experience was mainly on Airbus aircraft, he mistakenly moved the B787 flaps lever to fully retracted instead of the MLG lever. To this end I studied the layouts of the B787 and Airbus A320 consoles to see if that might explain this basic error. I discovered that the B787 Flaps lever is just to the right of the B787's single screen and that the A320's MLG lever is also just to the right of the lower screen. I therefore consider it possible that without thinking, the PNF pushed the Flaps lever up to fully retracted imagining that he was retracting the MLG. I apologize for not providing images but I am not allowed to do that until I have submitted at least 8 posts.

     From the report, there is no indicated time stamp identifying the point when one pilot asked the other "why did you cut off"
     <br/>
     This could explain the the assumption that it took ten seconds to reverse the switch positions.
     <br/>
     Cut off could have been noticed at any point later than 08:08:42 but before 08:08:52.

  From my reading of the AAIB report, the delay in noticing the cut off switch position could not have been any later than 08:08:47 because the reference to the verbal exchange was written before the reference to the RAT deployment and I assume the written narrative follows the chronological sequence of events.  The delay in resetting those fuel switches might therefore have been no more than 5 seconds.  It is a pity that the pilot making the challenge didn't simply reset the switches to run instead of challenging the other pilot.  I frequently tell people who blow their horns at pedestrians or other motorists that blowing the horn isn't going to help them avoid an accident and that what they really need to do in the limited time available to them is concentrate on applying the brakes and turning the steering wheel.

    Honeywell Switch Gate Configurations (Ref: honeywell_hwscs06627_1-1735572)
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   This extract from the datasheet of the Honeywell switch installed in the B787 for switching between Cut Off and Run shows the various gates that can be incorporated in such a switch.  I suspect that it is Configuration D which allows the switch to be in one or other of only 2 positions.  But the centre gate has a relatively wide flat table on which the switch can rest if it is not moved correctly to either the Run or Cut Off position.  I therefore think that it is not beyond the realm of possibility that both switches may have initially been resting on the gate and then slipped into the cut off position during take off.  However, what militates against this theory are the words of the challenge, "Why did you do that?" suggesting that one pilot had seen the other pilot actually flip the switches.

  Thanks for your valuable input.  Based on it I shall delete a comment I just made that suggested the very scenario that your experience says is highly unlikely.

  Yes, Honeywell call them toggle switches, but Torquetalk was obviously using the term to describe switches that don't need to be pulled up to be moved.  I don't know the correct term for the pull up and move switches and Honeywell's data sheets didn't enlighten me because they referred  to their switches as toggle switches. Maybe they should be called Gated Toggle Switches.
