  There is a lot of grasping at straws in this thread. It seems pretty simple to me and only one explanation that fits the evidence. About three seconds after takeoff the Captain noted the FO turn of the fuel cutoff switches. He immediately questioned that for obvious reasons and the FO replied he did not again for reasons that seem obvious to me. He did not want it on the tape and he wanted to delay the Captain in trying to switch them back on. Had the fuel cutoff switches been restored immediately before the engines unspooled the accident would have been avoided. In addition the timing of the cutoff switches movement is exactly what you would expect if the copilot was using one hand trying to be discreet in his actions.

     "The aircraft achieved the maximum recorded airspeed of 180 Knots IAS at about 08:08:42 UTC and immediately thereafter, the Engine 1 and Engine 2 fuel cutoff switches transitioned from RUN to CUTOFF position one after another with a time gap of 01 sec."

   This might have been discussed but as has been suggested upthread; a possible scenario is that at some point, PIC took their hands off the thrust levers and/or placed them in a guarding position behind the thrust levers at their base - but by doing so unfortunately nudged the Fuel cut-off switches to 'Off' - perhaps 'helped' by there either being incorrectly fitted locking mechanisms or worn locking mechanisms ?

  3 possibilities come to mind:
  <br>
   <br/>
   1. Pilot who moved fuel switches to off did not do so intentionally to cause the outcome, but for some reason unknown (extreme fatigue, medical condition, medication/drug) somehow confused the action of retracting gear with shutdown procedure at end of flight.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   2. Unthinkably, but very possibly, pilot who moved fuel switches did so intentionally, likely planned ahead of time to catch out other pilot at a moment where focus was intently on flying &amp; recovery most unlikely. Mental illness, drug use, personal circumstances behind it.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   3. Something extraordinary which was never encountered before which caused or allowed fuel switches to move on their own.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   When both pilots flying &amp; personal history is investigated, more is likely to emerge, maybe something to support possibility 1 above, where a pilot had on some previous occasions got sequences confused, or suffered brief episodes of  seizures whee he took strange actions.

     The accident aircraft was written up for a status message of &rdquo;STAB POS XDCR&rdquo; on the previous flight, which is a message relating to implausible data from the stab trim switches. It was released from maintenance (according to the preliminary report) at 06:40UTC ahead of an 07:40UTC departure (the crash flight) with &rdquo;no fault found&rdquo;.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     On the 787-8, as all modern planes, switches are not cabled as dry closing contacts all the way from the switch poles to the affected end devices (FADECs in the case of fuel cutoff switches), but rather connect locally to an analogue/digital converter to encode the switch position data onto the digital comms bus ARINC629 which allows all aircraft systems to talk to one another.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Are the fuel cutoff switches, which are positioned adjacent to the stab trim switches, connected to the same ADC module which produced the error message on the previous flight, which maintenance was unable to resolve before the accident flight took off? I do not know, but it must be worthy of being looked into.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I believe the fuel cutoff switches are one of the exceptions to this. They are direct wired. Stab trim may well be too.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I think they're called remote data concentrators - in many cases it is a conversion from a direct digital input to a bus signal; electronics would not call it an 'analog' input unless it was actually measuring a quantitative value.

      Was the RAT deployed manually?

     <br/>
     <br/>
     It suggests to me that the RAT deployment was initiated while the engines were still above idle and generating electrical power. Obviously one of the pilots could have done it via depressing the switch, as it's a "dual engine failure/stall" memory item (see

     Is there a way for the RAT to deploy while the engines are still above idle?
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I think I have seen a previous reference that the generators are disconnected when you select the switches to cutoff (or very shortly afterwards), not when the engine actually drops below idle. That could account for a few seconds of spool down time.

  tdracer hit the nail on the head in one of the earlier threads. Two possibilities: Software shut down the engines, or someone put the fuel switches to cutoff.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It wasn\x92t software. The question now is who shut down the engines and why?

  Argue fuel switches mechanics, liquid, falling items, electronics, etc, as much as you want, but who and why is where we will end up.

     I just looked at a picture of the 787 throttle area and I don't see how one would ever confuse the stabilizer cutout switches with the engine fuel cutoff switches. They are completely different in look and feel and operation.

  On a British twin fast jet in the early 80\x92s a pilot incorrectly assessed his accel on take off in formation was too slow. In aborting he moved his hand towards the hook deployment lever under the LH console which required a cupped hand, straight pull back to drop the hook. Instead he flipped out a horizontal lever on the side of the same console that he then grasped and pulled back, jettisoning the canopy\x85The aviation psychologist explained that once the wrong handle was selected,
  <u>
   even though it required a different method of operation
  </u>
  ,  the brain ( muscle memory) would trigger the correct action to operate it. That would explain the action of operating the incorrect switch.
  <br/>
  It doesn\x92t explain the reason behind going for the stab cut out switches when the report makes no mention of any stab warning - which surely would be a highly Important event given the closeness of the switches.

     3 possibilities come to mind:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     1. Pilot who moved fuel switches to off did not do so intentionally to cause the outcome, but for some reason unknown.............somehow confused the action of retracting gear with shutdown procedure at end of flight..
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  This crossed my mind too. This is called an "action-slip" by designers: a valid and frequently practised action being applied to entirely the wrong situation, resulting in an (extremely) invalid action.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On this flight, the relative drop in noise and calm that follows the landing gear doors closing after the gear retracts during the initial climb, might have caused an action slip by PIC to perform the engine shut-down procedure used when parking on stand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Unlikely though, I would hope.

     There is a lot of grasping at straws in this thread. It seems pretty simple to me and only one explanation that fits the evidence. About three seconds after takeoff the Captain noted the FO turn of the fuel cutoff switches. He immediately questioned that for obvious reasons and the FO replied he did not again for reasons that seem obvious to me. He did not want it on the tape and he wanted to delay the Captain in trying to switch them back on. Had the fuel cutoff switches been restored immediately before the engines unspooled the accident would have been avoided. In addition the timing of the cutoff switches movement is exactly what you would expect if the copilot was using one hand trying to be discreet in his actions.
    </div>
   </div>

  The prelim report does not attribute any actions or conversational elements to any individual.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The prelim report makes clear that the right seat is PF and the left seat is PM.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  IMO you should delete this post.

  So, under this scenario an 8,000+ hour PIC on type watches the FO select the Fuel Cut-off switches to Cut-off a couple of hundred feet off the ground, and rather than immediately resetting the switches to Run, he has a short Q&amp;A with the FO, and waits a full 10 seconds before taking any remedial action.

  Has anyone answered whether there is any message when the engine CutOff switches are transitioned in this situation?

  If there isn't then the asker must have seen it being done. If there is, then it's still not absolutely pinned to a pilot, is it?

  Where on Earth do you guys get the understanding the FO moved the switches? The FO is PF. His hands are on the yoke. Likely both of them.

  Just read all 16 pages - been flying! I think comment \x93why did you cutoff\x94 is not the reaction I would expect from a Training Captain who has just witnessed a trainee turn both fuel control switches off. They would possibly utter an exclamation, but would surely correct the error immediately - this didn\x92t happen for 10secs. The words are more likely to have come from an FO under training who has both hands on the control column and is concentrating on the rotation.
  <br>
   <br>
    Every flight we do as PM we move both fuel control switches to cutoff, 1 after the other, with a gap of about 1 sec between each one. It\x92s a learnt action in response to the phrase \x93shutdown\x94.
    <br>
     Every sim the TC has conducted he will have moved critical switches without much thought in order to setup the sim for the exercise. I remember being slightly shocked one day on the aircraft, having been training in the sim the previous day, that I nearly operated a critical control without thought. It\x92s something I had to consciously guard against after that.
     <br>
      <br>
       There is no rational explanation for doing it though - moving both fuel control switches down instead of moving the gear lever up is not a likely action slip. It seems either a totally subconscious act or a totally deliberate act.

  Engine shutdown/restart.
  <br/>
  As Captains of Boeing twins, which fuel switch do you typically move first, Eng 1 or Eng 2?
  <br/>
  As First Officers, same question.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Higher probability that the PM (Captain) manipulated the switches given the sequence of events.

     10 seconds to respond is a long long time if you\x92ve just made a silly mistake, you\x92d have those switches back on in a second. The startle factor isn\x92t really a factor here, because you
     <b>
      know
     </b>
     what just happened.
     <br/>
     What is also unusual to me is the 4 second gap between moving Eng 1 fuel switch from cutoff to run, and moving Eng 2 fuel switch from cutoff to run.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     One would imagine that in this situation, speed of response would have been critical. Why the slow, deliberate \x91reaction\x92?
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Bear in mind that if sampled at 1Hz, that 4s could be as short as 2 seconds in reality (or indeed as long as 6 seconds).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Either way, it's longer than you'd expect (subjectively) , and longer than it took to turn them off.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  *Speculation* could be due to attempted prevention of the action?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alternatively, could pilot be waiting for some kind of verification from the airplane before turning back on the second one? For example the APU inlet door opened half way between the first and second switches, would this be immediately apparent to the pilot?
