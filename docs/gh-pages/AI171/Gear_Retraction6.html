  Not a pilot, but an engineer with some experience in accident / incident investigation.
  <br/>
  One thing that strikes me in this and the previous closed threads is the lengthy back-and-forth discussion about potential technical faults that could lead to this accident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, there has been relatively little discussion about the #1 cause of all airplane accident - pilots' mistakes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Except for the initial conversation about mistakenly retracting flaps instead of landing gear, which eventually was dismissed in favor of engine failure as there has been an almost unanimous agreement that even if such mistake was made, it was recoverable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But what if the pilots made
  <u>
   more than one
  </u>
  consecutive mistakes?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mis-diagnosing the first abnormal behavior and making things worse by performing another action that instead of correcting the first mistake, turned the situation unrecoverable. The history of aircraft accidents is full of examples when a first, relatively benign issue was made much worse and eventually tragic by pilots' subsequent actions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Frankly, I think it is much more likely that the pilots made several consecutive mistakes than eventually led to the crash than a 1-in-a-billion unrecoverable mechanic failure. I'm looking forward to the CVR and FDR transcripts and I suspect that we will learn that after whatever happened first (pilot's mistake or minor technical failure), it was subsequent pilot's action that turned a manageable situation into a tragic accident.

  this vey situation happened to a good friend of mine, former Tornado pilot with 25 years on airliners, as a captain and PF on a B777. In his words he was initially totally confused why the aircraft stopped climbing. He engaged the autopilot and quickly realised the problem but they came very close to stalling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I would not like to place money on how quickly I would recognise the, highly unusual, situation of flaps being retracted with the gear remaining down and react appropriately.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Air India flight was circa 30 seconds from lift-off to crashing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I am sure an initial report will soon publish the basic facts.

     I previously speculated the forward truck tilt was proof the gear had been selected UP and the retraction sequence was interrupted.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I\x92m not so sure now and believe there is a different conclusion from this non-normal gear position.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     In normal retraction sequence the gear doors open almost instantaneously after the forward truck tilt. It does seem coincidental the tilt was completed while no indication of the doors opening is visible on the rooftop video, which would suggest hydraulic failure at that exact moment; this precise timing of interruption in the retraction sequence feels unlikely. So is there a more likely answer for the forward truck tilt that does not involve movement of the gear lever?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I suspect it\x92s more likely that C hydraulics lost power
     <u>
      prior
     </u>
     to rotation, as a consequence the truck could not tilt
     <u>
      rearward
     </u>
     during rotation as it normally should. Therefore it\x92s probable it always stayed in a neutral or forward tilt position from the take off run until we see it in the rooftop video. If the gear was behaving normally, and the crew had omitted to retract, it should be hanging rearwards. Watch any 787-8 takeoff video and you can see at rotation all 4 main wheels stay on the runway as the aircraft rotates. Just after wheels up they tilt rearwards. It\x92s a very subtle position change.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     If the gear was always in a neutral or forward truck tilt position then this undermines the theory that retraction sequence was interrupted. It insinuates the C hydraulic and electrical failure happened
     <u>
      prior
     </u>
     to main wheels lift off.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     For this reason I believe we cannot assume that gear UP was selected nor that retraction was interrupted. I\x92m seeing lots of social media posts which suggest the forward tilt means gear was in retraction and I don\x92t believe it was now.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I think the truck tilt position is key to understanding the timeline of system failures and whether the automatic RAT deployment was triggered by power failures or engine(s) failure. The question remains, did loss of center hydraulics happen before or after loss of thrust?
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I originally was onboard with the truck tilt seen in the one video being proof that the gear handle was selected rather than the flap handle. But after watching several videos and an "endless" web search for info, I also have started to think that there was a problem before the gear handle was moved.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a normal retraction, the main gear doors begin to open before the truck tilt is complete (roughly when the gear trucks are "level", seen around 8-10 second marks of
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZwzACp-q9U" target="_blank">
   this video
  </a>
  ). The nose gear doors open at the same time the main gear tilt starts (seen in Jetstar video linked below). It's too blurry in the video/stills of the accident aircraft to definitively say the nose doors are not open, but I'd say no. And it's pretty much a certainty that the main gear doors are not open. And finally I think it is also pretty clear that the main gear trucks are tilted down to the retract position.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I have no confirmation of this, but I read (or heard someone say in a video) that the truck tilt actuator was a "single acting" actuator, meaning hydraulic pressure held it in the toe up position and it was spring loaded to the retract position. Which means if hydraulic pressure was lost due to loss of power to the electric driven center hydraulic system, then the main gear trucks would tilt forward on their own without moving the gear handle. The Jetstar burst tire video somewhat backs this up, in that the blown tire caused a leak to the center hydraulic system and an alternate extension was required (thus the reason the main doors are down during the landing). No hydraulic pressure means the main gear trucks remained pointing nose down during the landing.

  The doors on a 788 don't open prior to tilt. The gear doors open for 30 seconds automatically after takeoff on the 789 and 78-10 in anticipation of selecting gear up, but not the 788.

  WHEN something catastrophic happens, like dual engine failure, that then creates a query about any "duality" between two standalone systems that really should have nothing whatsoever in common... except the PF.
  <br/>
  Nothing in common? Is that really the case for the 787-8 in the Air India 787 crash?
  <br/>
  Look at these three TCMA-related links in the order presented and note the proforma prescriptive caveats in the first two:
  <br/>
  <br/>

  <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US6704630B2/en" target="_blank">
   https://patents.google.com/patent/US6704630B2/en
  </a>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  TCMA is designed to detect and accommodate single failures within the EEC/FADEC, preventing a failure from jeopardizing the safe operation of the aircraft.
  <br/>
  Implementation:
  <br/>
  It involves implementing specific software changes within the engine's control system (EEC).
  <br/>
  Regulation:
  <br/>
  After some incidents, the design change was mandated by regulators, with a deadline for production aircraft by December 31, 2018, and a retrofit plan for existing aircraft.
  <br/>
  Boeing 787 Application:
  <br/>
  The TCMA feature is specifically relevant to the 787-8 equipped with GEnx-1B engines, but it may also be applicable to other 787 variants using the same engine type.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first two links are respectively the request for and FAA affirmation/approval for a GENx-1b software system called TCMA (Thrust Control Malfunction Accommodation). TCMA is the system that precludes High Uncommanded Thrust (HUT) after touchdown by fuel-chopping the engines. It is designed to avoid runway departures. One input is power-lever position. It's then fair to say that (additionally) Air/Ground sensing is quintessentially vital (as to when the system is "armed" and can do this fuel-chop). The third link is the complex description (with diagrams) of the patent application's design functionality of TCMA.
  <br/>
  FROM THE 3rd link above:
  <br/>
  "&ZeroWidthSpace;&ZeroWidthSpace;&ZeroWidthSpace;&ZeroWidthSpace;&ZeroWidthSpace;&ZeroWidthSpace;The method of the present invention compares the engine's actual power level with a threshold contour defined by the TCMA software package. When the TCMA software package determines that a thrust control malfunction has occurred, based on the engine's power level exceeding the threshold contour, the engine is shut down by the TCMA circuit." It is also notable that it says within the 3rd link that "Typically the aircraft is allowed to operate for a limited period of time with just a single operative processing subsystem."
  <br/>
  That Air India 787 was not long out of maintenance.
  <br/>
  We are then motivated to ask "what dictates the Air/Ground sensing". Is it just a Weight-on-Wheels microswitch or a RADAlt? (or both? or triplicated micro-switches?). We may then ask: "Did Air India implement the post-5G changes to their RADAlts that concentrated on maintaining their auto-land capability (in the face of 5G interference with RADAlts?) I seem to recall that the FAA's dictums on this pointed out that it was an individual nation's responsibility to both control their 5G frequency spectrums and implement changes to Radar altimeters that would work interference-free in critical phases of flight. What has the Indian regulator done in this regard as the responsible entity? The whole shemozzle, starting with the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) spectrum allocations, was an ongoing fight between the telecom giants and their getting their new mobile tech to market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  So where are we going with this line of causal reasoning? The only commonality/duality between left and right engines is the software driving the TCMA as monitored by the TCMA software incorporated in each engine's EEC. Most pundits have identified the gear-tilt as evidence that only the centre electrically-driven pump can do the gear-tilt if the engines' other two hyd systems are suddenly both in QUIT mode (which accords also with the instant RAT deployment and loud noise heard by the sole survivor) - and an ensuing transition from climb-out to a deadly sinking and commensurate attitude change for speed maint.
  <br/>
  My unavoidable conclusion is that the selection of gear UP and the breaking of the gear downlocks (and WOW sensing and energization of the RADALTs) called upon the TCMA to fuel-chop the engines (via the TCMA functionality in each engine's EEC).
  <br/>
  We could start by looking at the No Break Power Transfer (NBPT) tech used in modern airliners. This has led to Gen Control Panel meltdowns in 777's due to GEN contact meltdown. I know of one instance when a 773 was reduced to a RAT only landing enroute and another where a disastrous MEC fire occurred after start on pushback at LHR. A description of the systems glitch often experienced is at the following link. It's quite apparently a "gear-up" hiccup with potential damning consequences for smooth TCMA operation. As to be seen in the quality videos, a fuel-chop provides no real clue (such as engine failure/smoke/fire classically does). An uncommanded "reset" of the two engine's TCMA's upon gear retraction (link below) is trackable to be the sought after "duality" leading to a "both simultaneously quit" engine failure. These momentary electrical glitches and instant "resets" are described in the two links below. Food for reasoned thought?

  One comment here, and maybe I am mis-understanding your comment, but the landing gear
  <i>
   <b>
    only
   </b>
  </i>
  operates via the center hydraulics. It does not matter whether the Left/Right engine driven hydraulic systems are operative or not. The RAT will only pressurize the primary flight control portion of the center hydraulics.

     Thanks. Do we know that these are monitored by TCMA for air/ground state and if so, do we know the logic used to make a determination based on those inputs? Alternatively, do you know where we should be looking for those answers?

  No idea. I only got that info from the Master MEL on the FAA website. According to the MMEL the aircraft can be dispatched as long as there is one of each type sensor working on each main gear. (AIs MEL could be more restrictive)

  Is there any software provision for the TCMA to know for sure that the gear is neither up nor down? I would doubt it. Does that uncertainty affect the thrust-lever's positional input?

  As a pilot with 40+ years of professional flying, currently on the B777, and with some background in modelling aircraft performance, I've got a few observations, having read all posts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Flaps &amp; Takeoff
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The flaps were out for takeoff, which was normal: normal rotation rate, right place on the runway. Debris also shows the flaps were out at impact. The plane's flight path completely matched what you'd expect from a flight with flaps set correctly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Flight Controls &amp; Pilot Action
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To my mind, the controls were clearly working right up to the very end of that tragic flight. This also strongly suggests the plane never had any asymmetric thrust, because there's no sign of yaw, rudder, or big aileron/spoiler movements. The pilots seemed to guide the plane accurately and consistently, just like an experienced crew would. It looks like they were highly skilled from the start: immediately after rotation, they lowered the nose a bit to keep the plane flying. They also bleed off speed to avoid ground contact. Eventually, with no speed left, the plane descends, but it still looked like they were in control. The instinctive pitch-up right before impact is what a lot of pilots would do.
  <br/>

  <br/>
  <br/>
  Communicate: May as well let people know it\x92s going to be a bad day and to get there ASAP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Booster Pumps
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Engines don't actually need booster pumps at sea level to get takeoff thrust. (tdracer)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Restart
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There's no noise of the engines spooling up at impact. The mobile phone footage just has the RAT noise, normal airframe sounds, and impact noises. I didn't hear any engine spooling up. That witness talking about a "revving, starting noise" sounds to me like he was trying to describe the RAT noise, which we're all pretty familiar with now.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Engine Spool Down
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When I did this for real in an actual plane (we had an uncontrollable engine, but also three good ones), stuck at about 30% maximum thrust, at 220 knots, it was an instantaneous spool-down \x96 really dramatic. The yaw came on so suddenly it felt like a heavy catering truck had slammed into us at speed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Engines
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They appear to get the plane to the correct speed and position on the runway as commanded, then at a time very close to rotate they stop providing thrust. The rest of the flight is consistent with gliding flight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rotate vs. Air/Ground Switching Vs Pilot action
  <br/>
  <br/>
  (This is my take, it might seem counterintuitive, if you know better help) On a normal takeoff at rotation, liquids don't slide backward any more than they do during the takeoff roll itself. They slide back during the takeoff roll, and at rotation, there's actually a slight reduction in those backward forces. The main force is still pushing them back, but because the wings are now generating lift, there's more drag than when the plane was just rolling on its wheels. So, if liquids have pooled at the back of something at rotation, during and just after that maneuver, they'll actually ease forward a bit. The main force is still pushing them back, but it's less so. My take is if something sudden happens around rotation, I think it's probably more connected to something like the air/ground sensing or pilot action, but it is still possible that pooled liquids sloshing forward a little could also cause it.
  <br/>
  Pilots have to do a few things at rotate time, pull back in the controls, not the thrust levers in error and then move the landing gear lever. Over the years there's been a few action slips, so unintended control movements.

     One comment here, and maybe I am mis-understanding your comment, but the landing gear
     <i>
      <b>
       only
      </b>
     </i>
     operates via the center hydraulics. It does not matter whether the Left/Right engine driven hydraulic systems are operative or not. The RAT will only pressurize the primary flight control portion of the center hydraulics.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Are you saying that the RAT cannot power retraction of the gear, neither via its own hydraulic pump nor via its generator providing power to the centre system pumps?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Or could it be that it's capable of delivering enough power (via either route) to move the tilt actuator but not a humungous retraction jack?

     If a gear retraction remains in "tilt", then what does that

     Perhaps the safer solution should be an additional circuitry micro-switch feed of all three "up and locked"? (that agrees with the gear-handle).
     <br/>
     Also waiting to hear what the 787-8 RADALT status is? Was it ever 5G emanations-proofed?
     <br/>
     Is there any software provision for the TCMA to know for sure that the gear is neither up nor down? I would doubt it. Does that uncertainty affect the thrust-lever's positional input?
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  If the 787 is not different to all other aircaft, the WoW senses and putouts only one parameter that is always 1 or 0. There is no netherlands in between. The physical motion the switch is sensing migh have not reach it other end at the time the switch changes its output, but it is irrevelant. If there is a requirement to know that the motion has reaches it\x92s other end, another switch (or other type of sensor) is needed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Using up and locked as signal to prevent TCMA activation is obviously more dangerous as it allows TCMA to function while the aircraft is in the air.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Even in the same aircraft there might be different logics to determin if the aicraft is on the ground or in the air, depending what is the priority. Is the priority to know that the aircraft is in the air or on the ground or even NOT in the air. Some of those logics could use up-and-locked sensors and the gear handle position.

  Pooled water around the moisture barrier is just looking for a suitable access point to drain into. The 3 events I am aware of in the B744 were all during manoeuvring, 2 at rotate and one during a descending turn.

    Peak longitudinal acceleration occurs around the time the engines achieve the target N1 (EPR) and decays thereafter, as a function of aerodynamic drag rolling drag and the reduction of the engine net thrust. At rotate, pitching to achieve the target V2+ increment takes acceleration to the TAS increment in the second segment. The change in attitude results in the vertical component from gravity being recorded in the longitudinal axis. The accelerations are around 0.25 at peak and decay to near 0.1 or so at Vr, and then around 0 in the SSL at steady CAS but increasing TAS, can be a slight negative. (If you look at the accelerations on the FDR at 8Hz they are also measuring the

  That is one conclusion (which I now suggest is unlikely), because you are assuming:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  1. The hydraulic failure happened exactly when the truck had tilted forward but the split-second before the gear doors could open. That exact timing seems too coincidental.
  <br/>
  2. The crew selected Gear Up. We have no proof of this. I speculate the crew never got as far as "Positive Rate...Gear Up" because they were already engrossed in flying the aircraft and processing their thrust problem. If an electrical problem had developed (as evidenced by the RAT deployment) the flight instrumentation would have been flickering and a flurry of silent master caution alerts would be very distracting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I suggest it's more likely that the truck remained in a forward tilt from the takeoff run because the hydraulic failure happened
  <u>
   prior
  </u>
  to rotation, therefore keeping it in this unusual position. This answer does not rely on the gear lever position either. It also insinuates that their hydraulic problems occurred probably between V1 and VR.

     Regarding the momentum: As the first seconds of the climb were normal compared to previous T/Os of the same flight (speed &amp; altitude, confirmed by comparison of the RAW ADS-B data) I don't believe the engine failure happened before or on lift-off.

  I agree with this. For all the SLF reading and not posting ( good work!) there is a delay between the end of the takeoff run and the gear being selected up. I fly 737&rsquo;s so any 78 folk feel free to correct me but it looks like this;
  <br/>
  PM: &ldquo; V1 &hellip;.Rotate&rdquo;
  <br/>
  The PF then begins to rotate the aircraft up to a pre determined attitude which is normally between 13 and 15 degrees. They do this at a rate of between 2 and 3 degrees per second so about 5 or 6 seconds later the aircraft is at its climb out attitude. The PM is then looking at their instruments to confirm that the aircraft has a positive rate of climb, this takes a moment, maybe 1 to 3 seconds then;
  <br/>
  PM &ldquo; positive rate&rdquo;
  <br/>
  PF: &ldquo; gear up&rdquo;.
  <br/>
  So minimum 8 seconds but probably longer between the PM calling &ldquo;rotate&rdquo; and the gear being selected up.
  <br/>
  The relevance of all that is to say that if you suspect that the gear up cycle has been interrupted by a dual engine failure, then the engines may well have been producing thrust up to an altitude of 50-100ft or so, which ties in nicely with the max height reached, distance travelled etc.
  <br/>
  Mods this is clearly not a theory, just info for those who don&rsquo;t fly airliners to aid understanding.

     It doesn't have to be both engines. The loss of one engine with the gear down will still produce the same outcome.
     <br/>
     That still doesn't explain the bogies stowed position for retraction unless there was a total hydraulic failure, which could only occur if the aircraft was despatched with an unserviceable hydraulic system on the live engine side. Which in any case would be a no no.

  Thankyou I didn't know that and I'm not questioning you. I guess it doesn't matter electrically driven or engine driven, they cannot share the same power supply the gear must be retracted within 12 seconds. this in my opinion improves the argument for total electrical failure. Unless of course gear up was never selected..There must also have been a substantial loss of thrust on at least one engine.

  A mate tried gear/flap scenario in the sim earlier. Selecting flaps up (all the way) instead of the gear did not predjudice the flight path at all. They selected flaps up at normal gear retraction height and punched the AP in. The Slats remained out until 225kts (as per my post about 50 pages ago) and the aircraft climbed happily away clearing all obstacle by a good margin.

  Was that using the same aircraft weight, same flaps, same ambient temperature and with the same de-rate(s) as the accident flight? Presumably he had inside information to find the appropriate numbers?

     To my mind, this points to a potential software issue. 787s have already suffered from 2 separate software issues in which the passage of time causes a major and possibly catastrophic failure - the need to reboot systems before 51 days and 248 days have elapsed, due to poorly-written software. Given that history, the probability of there being a third, previously-unidentified but broadly similar in nature software issue seems surprisingly high. They aren't independent variables.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Such a passage-of-time software issue wouldn't show up in most (or possibly any) testing scenarios. It is the sort of issue that robust QA and static code analysis are designed to catch. But in at least two separate systems on the 787 it has not been caught prior to software shipping. Meanwhile, every new technical post demonstrates the myriad ways in which non-software potential causes are mitigated by redundant design.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The odds of two (or more) redundant mechanical systems failing in precisely the same way at precisely the same moment are very, very small. The odds of identical software on two (or more) redundant systems reaching a passage-of-time bug at precisely the same moment are, by contrast, very much higher. True redundancy would require different software on each redundant sub-system.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I am a software engineer, I find it alarming that the power control unit had the ability to command all AC generator control units to effectively shut down - regardless of that being the side-effect of a bug, or an ability of the system to call on in appropriate scenarios.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Integer overflow is a specific type of issue common to many systems, but like you said - it is something that should be found with robust QA and analysis. The ability to shut down all generators at once from a single source seems like a risky design decision to me and I agree with your point about different software on 2 or more redundant sub systems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  My theory is that this was an accepted risk because the engine-driven fuel pumps would be more than enough in most phases of flight to keep the engines running, and you would still have 2 engines for redundancy. The APU would also restore AC power in lets say 30 seconds and you would then have electric fuel pumps as well.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I think there are several factors that could explain how loss of all AC power during takeoff could lead to a crash:
  <ul>
   <li>
    The crash happened within 30 seconds - possibly too short for the APU to start, and the RAT doesn't power the AC electric fuel pumps
   </li>
   <li>
    The engine driven fuel pumps even if sufficient in level flight may have struggled during rotation - has Boeing tested an actual takeoff with only EDP feeding the engine while the fuel tanks are rotating and in extreme environments, or, have they only tested this statically?
   </li>
   <li>
    The takeoff was hot and heavy - combined with the landing gear stuck down and reduced thrust from loss of electric fuel pumps could this be enough?
   </li>
  </ul>

  can you ask him by any chance what the outcome would be with f15 or 20 speeds, but in a F5 config and a rotation at VrF15 ?
  <br/>
  and retract the flaps to 1 instead of gear ?
  <br/>
  sorry I don\x92t know if that has been tested already.
