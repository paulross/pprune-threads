     I've read your cite four times and could not find anything implying that " a momentary electrical event triggered at V1 (still on the ground) and restored after rotation before gear up is selected." I guess you need to explain it to me like I was eight.

  Sorry about that. The reply was aimed at the OP. from a software writers perspective, as you rightly point out it does not imply an electrical event actually occurred. As you raised that query writing software routines (programming) is no different and that's what we're looking for.

     IMO
     <br/>
     In the CCTV video, the aircraft stops climbing at 00:28. 3 seconds after, it starts visibly descending. At peak altitude, using the 197ft wingspan as a measure, the altitude is around 200ft or below. The fireball is at 00:48, 17s after descent starts visibly.
     <br/>
     Per google maps and the impact location mapped at avherald, the impact point is ~3990ft from the airport boundary road and about 4200ft from the midpoint of the runway threshold and the airport boundary road.
     <br/>
     16:1 to 25:1 is what I could find for the 787 glide ratio range (unpowered) with main landing gear down and flaps 5. So the aircraft could cover 16 to 25 ft horizontally for every 1 ft of descent.
     <br/>
     With a starting altitude of 200ft, that would imply it could have covered 3200ft.to 5000ft during unpowered descent.
     <br/>
     The actual distance covered, around 4000ft, certainly seems to suggest that the descent was unpowered.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Thanks for those numbers. Note, however, the max 787 L/D,
  <u>
   flaps and gear up
  </u>
  , is reportedly 21 (best in class), which casts shade on the credibility of those L/Ds, certainly 25 with the gear down. What is your source?
  <b>
   <i>
    <u>
     IF
    </u>
   </i>
  </b>
  the actual L/D with the gear down and flaps 5 is somewhat lower than 16 and given that starting height and distance traveled are correct\x97and considering that the aircraft might not have been at the speed for max L/D with the gear down and the possibility of a headwind\x97then there must have been some thrust during the descent (it did look to me to be somewhat flatter in that video taken from one side than I would have expected with the gear down, a relatively slow initial speed, and no thrust) or the engines were spooling back up at the end.

  If the photo of the flaps deployed at the accident site is actually F1 not F5 or if the flaps were pushed out during impact, then this is certainly plausible. I will look for the photo but it's in the thread somewhere. Others are stating they see a gap between the wing and the flap as an argument for the flaps deployed at F5. This was after the decent started..
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, I think their reaction would likely be to apply more power. I know mine would be. But anything is possible!

     There is no evidence of an electrical failure. What evidence? A surviving passenger thought he saw flickering lights? Give me a break.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Well, could be that. Or...
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Could be that the gear is quite clearly in the forward tilt position (indicating initial gear retraction has commenced), but then the gear never goes up. How does that occur? The gear in the 787 is driven in retraction by the center hydraulic system. How is the center hydraulic system powered? Electrically, via C1 and C2 EMP's. How are those EMP's supplied with power? Engine 1 and 2 (via a bootstrap from L1/2 R1/2 gens). The rat also connects to the center hydraulic system, but importantly, it does not supply hydraulic power to the gear. Only a select number of flight control surfaces.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  So, my question to you is, given you're claiming there is zero evidence of electrical failure, how did the gear move into the forward tilt position, but then not retract?

  (Sorry, Airbus here and not familiar with Boeing) Flap 5 to 1 reduction on the Boeing triggers autothrust reduction, is that correct? If so, are there any other conditions that need to be met for this to happen like being in some kind of takeoff mode? Just thinking whether this would have potential otherwise in other regimes to cause issues, discontinued approach perhaps.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Am slightly puzzled as to why if flap reduction triggering climb thrust is part of the standard logic (and presumably clean-up technique) then partial dual thrust loss wouldn\x92t be immediately recognised as the classic symptom of gear / flap retraction handling error? I presume Boeing pilots / air India are just as aware of this it as everyone else, strikes me as odd that one would immediately go into full dual EF mode. My instinctive reaction without knowing the Boeing would be to firewall both TLs, would this have worked in the early flap retraction logic scenario? Many thanks all

  I see the YouTube influencers are now shifting their speculation to the RAT deployment and loss of thrust theory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  we have to look at the limited evidence and stop
  <br/>
  speculating on things that have no evidence yet (like the flaps). Aside from RAT deployment the other red flag here is the partial gear retraction. On the 787-8 the bogey will tilt forwards first, before gear doors opens. Not to be confused with the -9 and -10 variants where the gear doors automatically open after liftoff.
  <br/>
  This is an important distinction because the Center hydraulics which is solely electrically pump driven (not engine) only had enough power to tilt the bogey, not open the doors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  so the question is, did the electrical failure (and loss of Center hydraulics power) happen before or after loss of thrust?

     So for those getting in the weeds with one in several trillion (or lower) probabilities of systems failures have you considered that that improper RTOW (with or without improper flap setting), flap retraction / climb thrust trigger, is of much higher probability and has actually happened ?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Anyway I think we&rsquo;ll find out soon if a systems failure was involved.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The FLCH Hold thing (Asiana) was never an issue and well known (at least on our line). And for a crew of 3 (or 4) to press a destabilized approach getting 40-ish knots too slow (!) isn&rsquo;t a systems problem &mdash; it&rsquo;s a breach of basic airmanship.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Have you considered that what you have described won&rsquo;t deploy the rat, initiate the gear retraction sequence or cause the auto start of the APU, all of which there is a fair bit of compelling evidence for?

  777/787 driver here.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Reading a few posts about an APU-to-pack takeoff, or a packs off takeoff on a 787, because of the hot weather, makes me shake my head.
  <br/>
  There is no bleed air on the 787. A packs off takeoff, or an apu to pack takeoff, is never done. There isn&rsquo;t a procedure in the fcom to describe it. It is also pointless. The packs are electrical.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Then the gear.
  <br/>
  When you lift off the runway, the gear doors open REGARDLESS of gear lever position. If you do not raise the gear within 30 seconds, the gear doors close again and you keep the gear down as you apparently desire. In the video, the gear doors are closed again as the airplane flies into the suburb. This requires normal hydraulics in system C, which was apprently available as the doors are closed again.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  takeoff performance:
  <br/>
  I entered all relevant weather parameters into my performance tool for Ahmedabad VAAH, rwy 23, 42 degrees C and no wind, qnh 1005.
  <br/>
  It comes up with flaps 10 as optimum, albeit for a 787-9 (don&rsquo;t have the possibility to calculate for the 787-8) But even the 787-9 is able to depart with flaps 5 in those conditions. Max tow around 230tons.

     They are near, but flaps have a lever and the gear is a switch.

  The gear is also a lever, with Up and Down positions. No \x93Off\x94 as in other, earlier, Boeing types.

  The 787-8 doesn\x92t have the early doors feature (i.e. the main gear doors open automatically after take off). The -9 &amp; -10 both have this feature. Later -8 may also do it (unknown if it was introduced on later production models), but as this is an early -8 that is irrelevant.

  Incorrect. Aircraft is a 787-8. It is does not have the early MLG door opening feature fitted to 787-9 &amp; -10.

     Reading a few posts about an APU-to-pack takeoff, or a packs off takeoff on a 787, because of the hot weather, makes me shake my head.
     <br/>
     There is no bleed air on the 787. A packs off takeoff, or an apu to pack takeoff, is never done. There isn\x92t a procedure in the fcom to describe it. It is also pointless. The packs are electrical.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Then the gear.
     <br/>
     When you lift off the runway, the gear doors open REGARDLESS of gear lever position. If you do not raise the gear within 30 seconds, the gear doors close again and you keep the gear down as you apparently desire. In the video, the gear doors are closed again as the airplane flies into the suburb. This requires normal hydraulics in system C, which was apprently available as the doors are closed again.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     takeoff performance:
     <br/>
     I entered all relevant weather parameters into my performance tool for Ahmedabad VAAH, rwy 23, 42 degrees C and no wind, qnh 1005.
     <br/>
     It comes up with flaps 10 as optimum, albeit for a 787-9 (don\x92t have the possibility to calculate for the 787-8) But even the 787-9 is able to depart with flaps 5 in those conditions. Max tow around 230tons.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Isn\x92t the gear door feature exclusive to the -9 and -10 variants, not on the -8?

  I'm posting some YT-links to show that 787-9 gear doors indeed open on lift-off, while the -8 gear doors open only when gear up is actually selected. I also include links to a 787-8 and a -9 that keep their LG down after departure. The 8 doors are not opening. The 9 doors do open again regardless and indeed close again about 30 seconds after lift-off.

     Have you considered that what you have described won\x92t deploy the rat, initiate the gear retraction sequence or cause the auto start of the APU, all of which there is a fair bit of compelling evidence for?
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Not sure we have definitive evidence of that at this point. Now cycling the engines through the FCSs or either deliberate or inadvertent movement of those to off would cause that but we\x92re still deep in we don\x92t know land.

  <br/>
  I do concur if it was a major systems breakdown without crew mistakes being made we will know shortly through emergency ADs.

  Well I am sorry but they don&rsquo;t.
  <br/>
  This yt video is somewhat cheesy, but it should make the -9 &ldquo;early open&rdquo; MLG door process clear to you, in a normal gear retraction. Unless you think this clown selected gear up on the ground.
  <br/>
  They cycle open before gear is selected up (&amp; even if gear is left down as you observed). Whereas on the -8 MLG doors will not budge until gear is selected up.

     After hours of reading I conclude that so far nobody has the slightest clue about what happened.
     <br/>
     1: Flaps were down
     <br/>
     2: The RAT story is based on a single unsharp video frame. Earlier frames were much sharper but the RAT could not be seen (although there was a sound).
     <br/>
     3. Lack of evidence
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I could be wrong, in that case please link QUALITY evidence so that we can learn something new.
     <br/>
     This way thousands of people are wasting countless hours.

  Visual evidence the rat was deployed, audio evidence the rat was deployed, evidence the APU inlet door was open, evidence the gear retraction was interrupted, evidence there was very little engine noise after departure, very obvious evidence that the aeroplane didn&rsquo;t have enough thrust to stop it descending into the ground. All of this strongly suggests that both engines were to all intents and purposes, and for want of a better word, &lsquo;failed&rsquo; now that could be intentional, accidental or because of some sort of technical malfunction or external factor. Nothing conclusive and no answers as to how or why, but not quite as wildly stabbing in the dark as your post would infer.

     IMO
     <br/>
     <br/>
     In the CCTV video, the aircraft stops climbing at 00:28. 3 seconds after, it starts visibly descending. At peak altitude, using the 197ft wingspan as a measure, the altitude is around 200ft or below. The fireball is at 00:48, 17s after descent starts visibly.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Per google maps and the impact location mapped at avherald, the impact point is ~3990ft from the airport boundary road and about 4200ft from the midpoint of the runway threshold and the airport boundary road.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     16:1 to 25:1 is what I could find for the 787 glide ratio range (unpowered) with main landing gear down and flaps 5. So the aircraft could cover 16 to 25 ft horizontally for every 1 ft of descent.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     With a starting altitude of 200ft, that would imply it could have covered 3200ft.to 5000ft during unpowered descent.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The actual distance covered, around 4000ft, certainly seems to suggest that the descent was unpowered.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  A later comment cast doubt on the glide ratio. But flying below wingspan altitude, which it was, will extend glide range because of the ground effect. Plus the descent glide range may have started later than the airport boundary. It seems plausible that the glide range is compatible with total and rapid loss of thrust.
