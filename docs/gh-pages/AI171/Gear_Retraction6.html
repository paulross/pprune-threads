  Incorrect. Aircraft is a 787-8. It is does not have the early MLG door opening feature fitted to 787-9 &amp; -10.

     Reading a few posts about an APU-to-pack takeoff, or a packs off takeoff on a 787, because of the hot weather, makes me shake my head.
     <br/>
     There is no bleed air on the 787. A packs off takeoff, or an apu to pack takeoff, is never done. There isn\x92t a procedure in the fcom to describe it. It is also pointless. The packs are electrical.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Then the gear.
     <br/>
     When you lift off the runway, the gear doors open REGARDLESS of gear lever position. If you do not raise the gear within 30 seconds, the gear doors close again and you keep the gear down as you apparently desire. In the video, the gear doors are closed again as the airplane flies into the suburb. This requires normal hydraulics in system C, which was apprently available as the doors are closed again.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     takeoff performance:
     <br/>
     I entered all relevant weather parameters into my performance tool for Ahmedabad VAAH, rwy 23, 42 degrees C and no wind, qnh 1005.
     <br/>
     It comes up with flaps 10 as optimum, albeit for a 787-9 (don\x92t have the possibility to calculate for the 787-8) But even the 787-9 is able to depart with flaps 5 in those conditions. Max tow around 230tons.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Isn\x92t the gear door feature exclusive to the -9 and -10 variants, not on the -8?

     Some previous posts have suggested that the 787-8 behaves differently from the later variants in respect of the automatic opening of the gear doors.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Are you saying that they are wrong?
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I'm posting some YT-links to show that 787-9 gear doors indeed open on lift-off, while the -8 gear doors open only when gear up is actually selected. I also include links to a 787-8 and a -9 that keep their LG down after departure. The 8 doors are not opening. The 9 doors do open again regardless and indeed close again about 30 seconds after lift-off.

     Have you considered that what you have described won\x92t deploy the rat, initiate the gear retraction sequence or cause the auto start of the APU, all of which there is a fair bit of compelling evidence for?
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Not sure we have definitive evidence of that at this point. Now cycling the engines through the FCSs or either deliberate or inadvertent movement of those to off would cause that but we\x92re still deep in we don\x92t know land.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I do concur if it was a major systems breakdown without crew mistakes being made we will know shortly through emergency ADs.

  Well I am sorry but they don&rsquo;t.
  <br/>
  This yt video is somewhat cheesy, but it should make the -9 &ldquo;early open&rdquo; MLG door process clear to you, in a normal gear retraction. Unless you think this clown selected gear up on the ground.
  <br/>
  They cycle open before gear is selected up (&amp; even if gear is left down as you observed). Whereas on the -8 MLG doors will not budge until gear is selected up.

     After hours of reading I conclude that so far nobody has the slightest clue about what happened.
     <br/>
     1: Flaps were down
     <br/>
     2: The RAT story is based on a single unsharp video frame. Earlier frames were much sharper but the RAT could not be seen (although there was a sound).
     <br/>
     3. Lack of evidence
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I could be wrong, in that case please link QUALITY evidence so that we can learn something new.
     <br/>
     This way thousands of people are wasting countless hours.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Visual evidence the rat was deployed, audio evidence the rat was deployed, evidence the APU inlet door was open, evidence the gear retraction was interrupted, evidence there was very little engine noise after departure, very obvious evidence that the aeroplane didn&rsquo;t have enough thrust to stop it descending into the ground. All of this strongly suggests that both engines were to all intents and purposes, and for want of a better word, &lsquo;failed&rsquo; now that could be intentional, accidental or because of some sort of technical malfunction or external factor. Nothing conclusive and no answers as to how or why, but not quite as wildly stabbing in the dark as your post would infer.

     IMO
     <br/>
     <br/>
     In the CCTV video, the aircraft stops climbing at 00:28. 3 seconds after, it starts visibly descending. At peak altitude, using the 197ft wingspan as a measure, the altitude is around 200ft or below. The fireball is at 00:48, 17s after descent starts visibly.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Per google maps and the impact location mapped at avherald, the impact point is ~3990ft from the airport boundary road and about 4200ft from the midpoint of the runway threshold and the airport boundary road.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     16:1 to 25:1 is what I could find for the 787 glide ratio range (unpowered) with main landing gear down and flaps 5. So the aircraft could cover 16 to 25 ft horizontally for every 1 ft of descent.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     With a starting altitude of 200ft, that would imply it could have covered 3200ft.to 5000ft during unpowered descent.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The actual distance covered, around 4000ft, certainly seems to suggest that the descent was unpowered.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  A later comment cast doubt on the glide ratio. But flying below wingspan altitude, which it was, will extend glide range because of the ground effect. Plus the descent glide range may have started later than the airport boundary. It seems plausible that the glide range is compatible with total and rapid loss of thrust.

     Visual evidence the rat was deployed, audio evidence the rat was deployed, evidence the APU inlet door was open, evidence the gear retraction was interrupted, evidence there was very little engine noise after departure, very obvious evidence that the aeroplane didn\x92t have enough thrust to stop it descending into the ground. All of this strongly suggests that both engines were to all intents and purposes, and for want of a better word, \x91failed\x92 now that could be intentional, accidental or because of some sort of technical malfunction or external factor. Nothing conclusive and no answers as to how or why, but not quite as wildly stabbing in the dark as your post would infer.

  We agree that there was a lack of thrust. Possibly caused by a dual engine failure. But the sharpest frames in the video do NOT show the RAT and this is counter evidence to the RAT theory. If there were substantial technical failures who knows what sounds could be generated. I find the evidence weak at best. And we immediately get into a chicken-egg problem: did some power issue of unknown nature cause an engine failure or did a dual engine failure occur, resulting in a power loss? Both are extremely unlikely and need to be backed by quality evidence. The video is not it, in my opinion. I don't know the APU intake mechanism and whether it could open after the impact.

  I&rsquo;m an ex-787 pilot. There are a number of defects on the 787 where you can dispatch under the MEL with an operational procedure that requires the gear to be left down for varying amounts of time after takeoff. You probably saw an aircraft that was carrying one of these defects. Routinely leaving the wheels out to cool the brakes isn&rsquo;t really a thing on the 787, despite lots of spotters thinking it is. In normal operations if you see a 787 with the wheels left out after takeoff it&rsquo;s almost certainly dispatched legally under the MEL and carrying out the associated operational procedure.

  The report of a seat back collapsing on rotation is a poorly rehashed version of the completely unrelated Air India Express flight 611 in October 2018. That flight did have a captain seat collapse on takeoff causing it to take off with reduced thrust, flying its landing gear through the localizer array and airport perimeter wall. But it eventually diverted and landed safely with no injuries. There are even YouTube videos about it,  e.g. search YouTube for "Boeing 737 flies through brick wall".

  Regarding the flashing green and white lights. On Airbus aircraft the emergency exit lights come on when the gear is down, and goes out when the gear is raised. Is this also the case on the 787?
  <br/>
  if so, if the gear is/stays in transit (as the gear tilt may suggest) can this make the exit lights cycle on and off?

  The electrical failure is rather a chicken-egg question.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Not knowing the 787, I\xb4d find it extremely hard to believe that a massive electrical failure would kill the engines. I gather from this thread that the landing gear retraction is driven by the electrically-powered Center hydraulic system. Retracting the gear is hard work for the system and it will put a strain on the two pumps and their supplying electric circuits, and the time of the alleged total power loss would seem to be in the vicinity of the suitable time to retract the gear.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But if there was some freak epidemic failure this inflicted upon the aircraft electrics, it is hard to imagine that this would affect both engines. There are still the autonomous FADEC governing them that run on their own internal generators (with a small external power source from the main systems, should the permanent magnet alternators fail) and do everything they can to keep the engine alive. As long as there is fuel flowing into the feed pipes, the engine should be kept running by the FADECs, and that this does not require the large tank pumps at low altitudes has been established in this thread.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Consequently, I\xb4d deem it plausible that the alleged power failure must have been a consequence of whatever happened to the engines. After all, the engines drive the available generators at this stage of flight, the APU with its additional generators is apparently not run for takeoff on the 787. I find it logically much easier to wrap my head around a situation in which an engine failure takes along the generators than one in which a massive, epidemic electric breakdown kills the engines.

     Do not discount the mistaken early flap retraction scenario too easily. Mull on this:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     PF commanded gear up on attaining positive rate of climb, fixating on the HUD.
     <br/>
     PM mistakenly raise flap lever from 5 to Flap 1 gate. Thrust reduced to Climb Thrust. Landing gear remained deployed. Massive loss of lift misidentified as loss of thrust. If any one pilot just had a dual engine failure scenario on a recent sim ride, brain and muscle memory would jump to loss of thrust in dual engine, prompting them to accomplish the recall memory items which called for both engine fuel control switches to CUTOFF and then RUN, and physically deployed the RAT.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     There would be immediate loss of thrust with the engine taking time to recover , if at all, at such low airspeed!
     <br/>
     The rest is left for Ppruners\x92 imagination.😖🥴😬
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  <br/>
  A loss of lift AND thrust at this critical juncture could have had caused this awful disaster. I think the data recorders have already revealed the cause but If it's this, then I don't think we will hear much anytime soon.

  The RAT being deployed or not, is an essential factor.

  The TCMA system should be inhibited when Air / Ground logic is in Air mode.
  <br/>
  I understand that it has Inputs from RadAlt, Weight on Wheels, etc.
  <br/>
  This airframe was reported to have had a history of significant electrical / electronic problems, including on the prior inbound flight.
  <br/>
  There may have been water ingress in the E&amp;E bay, likely causing corrosion or other damage.
  <br/>
  Chafed or damaged wiring / cable insulation within looms is possible. Including the landing gear microswitches.
  <br/>
  The landing gear may have been interrupted in the cycle.
  <br/>
  BOTH engines are reported to have shut down, so whatever happened is a system common to both engines.

  TCMA failing at the moment of gear retraction appears to fit with the available evidence.

     FrequentSLF: I would be more suspicious of the hardware that feeds TCMA. Rad Alt sensing could be in error, but possibly more likely is the hardware that senses weight on wheels. May be position sensing microswitches, or perhaps gear oil pressure, but would assume redundancy, eg: two sensors per leg, then some sort of voting logic on the sensor set to find faulty hardware.and make a decision. Doubt if the software is at fault, but is there a delay between sensor output, and command to shutdown the enigines ?. Alluded to doubts upthread, but I think the post was deleted. Question: Should TCMA really have the absolute power to auto shutdown engines at all, without some sort of confirmation ?.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  On the 747, Weight on Wheels (WoW) depends on prox sensors on the landing gear (i.e. gear compression). I don't know how that's done on the 787.
  <br/>
  The reason we used both Radio Alt and WoW is that both can give erroneous indications on certain conditions - RA can be 'fooled' by dense rain or even really dense fog (the signals bounce off the water and falsely indicate on-ground), the prox sensor system can subject to HIRF/Lightning interference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  TCMA acts quickly, but it does require some persistence, so an input glitch won't activate it (mainly N1, which is measured every 15 milliseconds).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  What sort of 'confirmation' do you have in mind - the regulator mandate that resulted in TCMA basically says we can't take credit for the flight crew.

  Thanks for the heads up.  The story also says, "No cause has yet been identified for what would be an extremely rare power loss from both engines, but on Sunday the Indian civil air authority (DGCA) began urgent pre-flight inspections of fuel systems, electronic engine controls and other systems on Indian Boeing 787s."

  And it quotes Juan Browne (Blancolirio): \x93There was something terribly wrong with this 787 jet and we need to find out really quickly what went wrong because we\x92ve got a thousand of these operating today and operators need to find out what happened.\x94

     On the 747, Weight on Wheels (WoW) depends on prox sensors on the landing gear (i.e. gear compression). I don't know how that's done on the 787.
     <br/>
     The reason we used both Radio Alt and WoW is that both can give erroneous indications on certain conditions - RA can be 'fooled' by dense rain or even really dense fog (the signals bounce off the water and falsely indicate on-ground), the prox sensor system can subject to HIRF/Lightning interference.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     TCMA acts quickly, but it does require some persistence, so an input glitch won't activate it (mainly N1, which is measured every 15 milliseconds).
     <br/>
     <br/>
     What sort of 'confirmation' do you have in mind - the regulator mandate that resulted in TCMA basically says we can't take credit for the flight crew.

  Where does the logic block that takes the WoW and other inputs to generate the singe air/ground indication live?  Is it somewhere that would be affected by the aircraft power systems?  Could a failure in the aircraft power cause a false ground indication to be sent to the FADECs?
