  Hoover from the generally respected Pilot Debrief channel put up his analysis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He analyses the point of rotation looking at the airport layout and using the video with the shack showing the aircraft rotate behind it, in that case the aircraft rotates at a reasonably normal place. That being the case what is the "cloud of particles" that appear to the left of the aircraft ?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He discounts electrical failure affecting both engines due 787 design, and fuel contamination due both engines fed from separate tanks unlikely to affect both engines at the same time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The possibility that one engine failure occurred at a critical point in the take off and that possibly the wrong engine fuel cutoff switch was pulled.

  All of which has been discussed and for the wing vortices and the fuel feed has been explained quite comprehensively, along with the fuel cut offs: have you not read these posts only made recently?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I repeat, do

   NOT
  </b>
  post repeats of discussions already had unless there is something of value which may change or enhance previous posts. This is a prime example of a post which should be vetted and dismissed before pressing Submit Reply ðŸ™ˆ

  That's ~950m (3100 ft.) from the threshold, and 2.5 km from the accident site.

  I like that we have a picture now, and that Hoover illustrates how he made the determination.
