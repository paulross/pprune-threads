     The FAA is saying it's a

     . Any suggestion that it's related to

     </i>
     is pure speculation. Possibly brought on by that slop 'report', which may have itself been somewhat inspired by the ADs.

  Agreed. But the FAA itself
  <b>
   <i>
    does
   </i>
  </b>
  speculate - on what basis, I have no idea.  They use the word "may", see here, last sentence (and in other ADs in the sequence):

  </a>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This paragraph (and one before) is/are also worth a read - they see no rush to fix, obviously.

  </a>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  100% Agree: any suggestion that it's in any way related to 171 is pure speculation. Sounds like these ADs apply only to small numbers of 787s. Don't even know if 171 was one of them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But installing lavatories directly above EE Bays? Who's the genius...? .
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anyway, I make a point of not going 'there' during the last half of any long flight. They are frequently "awash" and unpleasant places to be. The washbasins themselves are also prone to the ejecting of water onto the floors. Agreed, it's a ####ty problem.

     And every commercial airliner I'm familiar with has the prime electronics bay below the flight deck - for what should be obvious reasons.

     There is absolutely nothing unusual about the 787 arrangement in this regard.

  Yes, that was fairly much my point. The "Dream" was supposed to be revolutionary, "all" electric..., but it doesn't take a genius to copy an old, out-dated layout.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I see nothing wrong, everything right with the Main EE Bay being under the cockpit. It's the obvious place. But underneath a leak-prone lav? Even the plumbing fittings are problematic, often leaky. Water above, Electricity below... What do we anticipate? Time is the real issue here. We have two showers in our house. A few years on, both started leaking... It's not rocket science.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  How can we have innovation and improvement without I &amp; I? The more I learn...

     So how are you going to allow the pilot to relieve themselves - while maintaining post 9/11 security - without a lav up front?
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Ask the Apollo astronauts? The ISS Crew members? But don't mention 9/11! The fireballs just don't compare.
  <br/>

  It has been said that there are three stages of truth: ridicule, violent opposition and acceptance as self-evident.  Obviously, we're not there yet

  <br/>
  <br/>
  Of course the aircrew needs a lav within their easy reach. I don't have a cross section or plan to work with (Google not obliging), but if you post, I'll take a look. Likely, I'd compartmentalize the lav with the EE Bay space immediately below, and install a "bilge tray and drain" below the lav space and above the EE Bay compartment. If it
  <b>
   <i>
    has
   </i>
  </b>
  to be used for EE Bay gear, I'd probably rack the 28V Batteries there, with the required fireproof casings and exhaust ports etc. (Also absurd, but true.) And I'd make sure the batteries themselves were fully protected by moulded plastic "hats", similar to what they use on the big 12V battery pairs on large trucks. I guess you could fit a couple of TRUs there as well, again, well-protected from dripping conductive liquids... And maybe, you could house [one of?] the EE Bay air conditioner unit[s] there? But none of the flight-critical board racks or other sensitive electronic equipment.  Any moisture-related faults there would be just too random and difficult to pin down.

     It will come as no surprise to anyone that EE bays are well protected

  If that's so true, why the ADs about leakage from the lavs, listed earlier?

  Didn't I just say that?

  Ok, didn't mention thermal runaway, but that's the purpose of the fireproof boxes and exhaust ports. But the whole risk/ danger of thermal runaway is another issue, isn't it? There are safer batteries that are not lead-acid whales. Are the any other planes out there that need fireproof boxes and vent pipes to contain and purge burning battery fumes etc to the outside?  It's not just the fumes that are the issue, of course.

  Good to hear, hope you know them inside out and catch every issue.  Please keep an eye out for trickles down walls in the EE Bays though.
