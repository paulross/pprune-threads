     To those who still try to put the blame on the switches...
     <br/>
     - If the switches were defective (wrong type without the detent was installed), this airplane has been in operation for 10+ years - somebody would have noticed.
     <br/>
     - If the switches were defective due to wear, it's impossible that both would fail simultaneously at exactly the same time. Have you ever seen all FOUR wheel bearings in a car fail within one second of each other?
     <br/>
     - If this was an electric issue (spilled coffee theory), there is no way that ALL electrical contact simultaneously shorted into the exact condition to cut off the fuel. We would see one or two contacts fail first and some kind of "command disagreement", but not a nearly instantaneous total failure. Maybe only if somebody spilled a glass of mercury over the switches ...
     <br/>
     The only plausible explanation is that somebody moved them (for a reason unknown).
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Agreed: you would not see all contacts failing the same way, at the same time, in a multi-pole switch like that. Nothing is impossible, of course but the odds of that happening in one switch are extremely low. Two switches, at the same time?.
  <br/>
  Ditto for the idea of the physical detents failing, causing the switch lever to drop at the worst time. Not impossible, again, but both switches within a second of each other? Very low odds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Am I correct in thinking that engine cutoff would in flight would trigger a warning on EICAS?

  SLF.  But I've read in full both original threads and this thread.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Preliminary Report is written in excellent English, so I think one should pay close attention to what it says.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One thing I noticed is that at the bottom of P4 NTSB are stated as "..participated in the investigation".  However UK AAIB are only stated as "visited the site".  My reading is that UK AAIB are not participating?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another is that some items on the timescale are v precise, others much more vague.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A question :
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If the fuel switches were moved to cutoff, for whatever reason, what exactly would each pilot see as an EICAS warning.  I'm still unclear why one pilot asked the other why he cut off - actual observation of the action, or message.
