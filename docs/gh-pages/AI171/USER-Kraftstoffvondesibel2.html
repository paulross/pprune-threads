     Is option 2 possible? It was my idea too but does the switch "connect" when it is not properly in its guarded possition?

   </div>
  </div>
  If you look at the mechanism, and imagine the physical obstacle that makes the lift necessary not being there, it could conceivably be connecting, yes. It would then be like any other switch, really.

  No, it has the addition of an independently powered analog input cockpit area microphone. It also records everything else when systems are operating normally. Which they weren\x92t.

     That's a very good question.

  It can only know their electrical, not mechanical positions. Think about it, how would that work?

  <br/>
  Would love to see some kind of accelerometer reading of the moment the switches went to cut off. Or even cockpit area audio.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They will figure it out.

     Actually, why are switches that are only really required on the ground or in an engine shut down event where they are? Embraer's have the switches out of the way on an overhead panel and as well as detent locked, have a protective guard, one has to physically lift. If the PF had to physically carry out the engine shut down on an Embraer, he would have to raise his arm. Would be obvious to the PnF.

  I raised this on one of the other threads, they are supposed to be isolated systems, and I am sure they are according to electromechanical tradition, but for both human factors and electromechanical reasons, should\x92nt they be off to each side of the cockpit to be considered isolated?

     A douple-pole switch. One pole used for FDR signal for the physcial switch position. The other pole for the electrical switching circuit.

  That would only make a duplicate, wouldn\x92t it.
  <br/>
  And indeed they are 4 pole on-on switches, but one set of poles signals the spar valve directly while the other goes to the digital systems.

  I\x92d like to add for emphasis that we do not know what was said. We only have the investigators summary/narrative. We don\x92t know which exact words were used, or in which language they were spoken, or even which way across the command gradient those unknown words were uttered.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Having a non-english first language myself, I can find several translations from english to my own language of which all will be equally correct but fit each of the various interpretations in this thread.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Someone said the data and audio must be interprered together, but we don\x92t have the audio.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The other language bit os the \xabtransitioned\xbb rather than \xabmoved\xbb.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  We don\x92t know from the report whether it was moved. We know it electrically transitioned between states. If it was a short because of contamination, or the gate was wrongly installed or worn, cycling it back(or simply fiddling with it in high stress) explains both the sequence and time used.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The only thing we know is that the switches were physically in run when found. Right next to the throttles in Idle\x85
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There is also the sample rate issue raised by several. A millisecond difference can be sampled as a second difference. They might also not be sampled at the same time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Not aviation, but a automated system I owned recorded all positions and values of thousands of switches and potentiometers sequentially over about a second. The 787 is a much newer system, but processor speed isn\x92t necessarily the top priority.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  So maybe try and not put so much effort into analyzing words we don\x92t know and sub-second FDR data?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The cockpit area microphone just might have picked up discernable clicks or plonks from the switches being moved.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  how about this:
  <br/>
  A nice, uncontroversial alternative to cockpit video could be a small microphone array. It would, when visualising audio data, show where and when to the millimeter a sound changes or emanates in the cockpit, any switch or mechanical fault, but not arms moving, facial expressions or who does what.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It would be an easy add on/expansion to the existing battery powered area mic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They do it in large factories to pin-point loose  bolts or mechanical wear well ahead of tgem needing to be changed.

     Yet seconds later the transition from CUTOFF to RUN was recorded and was effective for both switches. "Effective" means all poles made contact, the spar fuel valves and EECs. Independently, on each side. We know this because both engines re-lit at different times.
     <br>

       Doesn't sound like spilled coffee or "a short."

  Sounds like you have never spilled coffee on something with thousands of switches.
  <br>
   It happens, you cycle(ie.fiddle) with them until you make contact again.
   <br>
    We don\x92t know how the switches moved, we only know when they made contact.

     Respectfully, your explanation is invented from your personal experience. It does not cleanly fit the facts as provided in the report, and in fact must assume the report authors intentionally omitted all description of cycling/fiddling. It also assumes spilling and shorting that are not described anywhere.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     A more straightforward explanation is that the controls were manually moved to CUTOFF. Then, seconds later they were manually and individually moved to RUN. According to the report, expected effects occurred with each "transition."
     <br/>
     <br/>
     "P1 Engine 1 and Engine 2 fuel cutoff switches transitioned from RUN to CUTOFF position"
     <br/>
     "Engine 1 fuel cutoff switch transitioned from CUTOFF to RUN"
     <br/>
     "Engine 2 fuel cutoff switch also transitions from CUTOFF to RUN"
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  <br/>
  You are absolutely correct insofar that is the most likely explanation, but see answer above. While I have found, as I suspect most, the deliberation angle most likely, since day one, it isn\x92t really fit for discussion, so the other, admittedly slightly more unlikely avenues are more appropriate and more interesting imho.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But you also underestimate my history with spilling coffee on large amounts of switches, but while tangentially relevant, that is for another thread in another forum.o-)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Intermittent faults with spillage and switches fixed by cycling/fiddling is a thing, and it is not contrary to the facts from the report. It is possible. It is also, admittedly not the most likely.
