  Thank you for your reply! There's a lot we agree on; unfortunately, I'll be cutting that from my response here.

     Sure, actual data is usually more accurate than eyeballed stuff. But not always. In fact, it's often the eye that determines that something measured or calculated is "Off". How accurate is ADS-B data? I've seen FR24 tracks go way off course then suddenly get corrected / interpolated, frequently. The erroneous data seems to be "removed" by their algorithm, but where are the errors arising? Why this inaccuracy, and therefore, how accurate are the datagrams referred to? I know there were no datagrams received during the backtrack that I accept actually occurred, but that's completely different from receiving erroneous ADS-B data.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Right. ADS-B is transmitted via radio, so reception can be patchy, or obstructed by someone else transmitting on the same frequency (e.g. other aircraft), so not every datagram that the aircraft sends gets received. When that happens, the live display of FR24 assumes the aircraft kept doing what it did, and when another datagram eventually comes in, it corrects the position. It also connects the locations of these datagrams, regardless of whether the aircraft actually went there. For example, in the AI171 there's a 4-minute gap between a datagram sent on the taxiway, and the next datagram sent when the aircraft was off the ground towards the departure end of the taxiway. FR24 then connected these points via the shortest route; but we know that the aircraft actually used the intervening 4 minutes to taxi to the approach end of the runway, where it then started its take-off run. So that was false. (Another source of errors is when different FR24 receivers don't have synchronised clocks, so a mixture of data from these can have weird artifacts as a result.)
  <br/>
  However, the datagrams that FR24 actually received were correct. They contain the GPS position of AI171 and its unadjusted barometric altitude, as determined by its onboard instruments. This data is as reliable as the instruments themselves are. (An example here is that the NTSB wasn't sure that the altimeter on the Blackhawk that crashed at Washington-Reagan was accurate; if that is the case, the ADS-B data would also be affected.)
  <br/>

  , FR24 have published the data that they actually received.

    Sure, the CCTV footage I've seen is very poor, a video, moved about and zoomed, of the CCTV screen. Not easy to judge, but still useful and could be analysed frame-by-frame to compensate for all the extraneous input. Anyway, it's obvious to me that the rate of climb dropped abruptly just before the flight attained its apex, as if thrust was suddenly cut off.

  Have you ever seen a parabolic trajectory from "the short end"?

    Knowing the momentum to altitude conversion, it might be possible to estimate whether that's true or not. The evident RAT deployment supports engine shutdown, not just engines to Idle, doesn't it? In that case, it would be useful to know at what altitude the engine shutdown took place.

  Yes.

    Okay, didn't know that, I guess suggests means it's uncertain? Can you tell me from what height to what height it suggests this?
   </div>
  </div>
  It's uncertain because the 787 rounds all altitudes it sends to the nearest multiple of 25. The altitudes sent were from 575 ft to 625 ft., but that's MSL and not adjusted for the weather: low air pressure makes that number higher than the actual altitude. FR24 adjusted this to 21ft climbing to 71 ft, but it could've been 30 to 60 or maybe 10 to 80, as it's rounded. I think it's fairly close to 50 feet of climb, though.

    And why all the wrong figures for the height attained, quoted in previous thread? Can't all be the atmospheric conditions.
   </div>
  </div>
  1) people taking the MSL altitude literally (625 ft)
  <br/>
  2) people adjusting for airport elevation (189 ft), but not for pressure: 437 ft
  <br/>
  3) people adjusting for pressure, some adjusting for temperature, get 71 to ~100 feet for the last recorded altitude.
  <br/>
  But while ADS-B reception was lost then (or the transmitter lost power), the aircraft continued climbing; examine the cctv video, knowing the wingspan is ~200 feet, we see that the aircraft reached 200 feet but not much more.

    One fact that alters things substantially is whether the survivor's impression is correct that possibly the engines started to spool up again just before impact.
   </div>
  </div>
  The survivor likened the sound to a car engine revving up. If you've listened to a good version of the phone video, you'll have noticed the "vroom" sound at the start that some likened to a motorcycle. That sound is the RAT in action, and you can imagine what that would sound like when it rapidly spins up: like a driver stepping on the throttle with their car engine in neutral.

    If that's the case then what does that do to the possibility or otherwise that the TMCA system caused a dual engine shutdown?
   </div>
  </div>
  The RAT deploying is a consequence of a dual engine shutdown. It says nothing about whether the TMCA was involved.

  How did you determine that the path was parabolic?

  By eyeball, did you measure something, did you have something to compare it to?

  PPL IR engineer in air trafic flow management, so not quite the right kind of engineer to talk about physics and total energy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nonetheless, I ran some calculation with the Eurocontrol BADA total energy model equation using a rough estimation of the height/time profile from the CCTV footage (wingspan yardstick method) and an approximation of the drag using a constant drag hypothesis of 200 kN. That amount of drag is about what a fully configured B788 on final approach generates, I felt it was an acceptable approximation for a less draggy configuration flown at higher than normal AoA but I could be very wrong. I used the total energy equation to calculate speed, inputs are the the height gains and the drag hypothesis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I find a B788 with a mass of 207 t and an initial speed of 185 kts with
  <b>
   no thrust from the rotation onward
  </b>
  could theoretically have traded 50 kts for 190 ft before descending back down at speeds between 135 kts and 130 kts, coming back to take off elevation 1950 m after the last ADSB position. The flown distance is sort of the checksum in this, it is not an input but rather the output of the model.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I also did the same exercise with the EK521 incident, assuming a 285 t B77W rotating at 155 kts for a go around on idle thrust. I guestimated 350 kN of drag (normal approach in full configuration is supposedly 380 kN) and got a speed decay to about 130 kts at 80 ft which is how high that particular aircraft got before coming back down. I am not sure this is enough to give confidence in my attempt at doing total energy calculation, but at least it doesn't seem too far off.

  FR24 has the GPS lat long position at each time - ground speed is then simply distance travelled over the time interval. The METAR quoted 25007KT and that should increase with height hence the nominal decrease in ground speed over the later ADS-B values - and probably the slight drift off the centre line once airborne.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An earlier poster defined the 787 ADS-B transmits with a height granularity of 25' - which explains the FR24 figures and I might posit that it was just about to transmit a 25' height increase when the electrical failure occurred.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rooftop video records a nominal
  <b>
   14s
  </b>
  flight time with RAT out throughout.
  <br/>
  The CCTV video records a nominal
  <b>
   32s
  </b>
  (from rotation) and subjectively the aircraft stops climbing
  <b>
   14s
  </b>
  after rotation - meaning
  <b>
   18s
  </b>
  of descent of which
  <b>
   14s
  </b>
  are captured in the rooftop video.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If we accept the RAT is out then it must have been deployed about
  <b>
   12-16s
  </b>
  after rotation, presumably immediately after the 4s of ADS-B data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another post referenced the RAT only supplying electrical power after 10s - I find that hard to believe, not instant obviously because there has to be some stabilisation time and startup/boot time but it would imply the LH flight instruments would only be active very late. Hopefully the RAT hydraulics would be effective quicker than that.

  This has been very briefly mentioned - inside a "quote" from an "official" - uptread, but I don't think has been specifically discussed here.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It "seems" that the Gujerati Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) have recovered a DVR (digital video recorder) from the accident aircraft:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <a href="https://www.financialexpress.com/india-news/what-is-a-dvr-key-device-recovered-from-air-india-ai-171-crash-may-hold-key-evidence/3879001/" target="_blank">
   https://www.financialexpress.com/ind...dence/3879001/
  </a>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As I understand it, the ATS were there to assist as necessary, not because of any posited terrorism link. The article posits that:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <i>
   The DVR in aviation settings records footage from CCTV cameras installed throughout the aircraft, including the cockpit, passenger cabin and entry/exit points. This footage is crucial for investigators as it provides visual evidence of activities before and during the flight, such as passenger boarding and ground operations.
  </i>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I'd not hear that Air India had such devices installed (the EAFR combo black box on the accident aircraft does have a "growth function" for adding video recordings at some future date). What's more the DVR seen carried by a "ATS Agent" in the picture and linked videos looks to me first undamaged and second like a domestic DVD player.....
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anyway, anyone know more of a DVR fitted to Air India aircraft for investigative purposes?
