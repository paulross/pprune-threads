     SLF Engineer(electrical -not aerospace) so no specialised knowledge of any kind.
     <br/>
     The TCMA discussions on here seem clear that in normal operation the TCMA functions should not
     <br/>
     operate in air mode and the TCMA has multiple inputs from various sensors (Rad alts, WOW sensors).
     <br/>
     My query is to how these signals are routed to the engines, are they compared/aggregated in or routed through
     <br/>
     the EE bays. If they are present in the EE bays then fdr's idea of a water leak at rotate into the EE bays
     <br/>
     could generate shorts from the HV buses to the TCMA units.
     <br/>
     Are the TCMA units designed to cope with 400V AC inputs where a low voltage input is expected.
     <br/>
     I appreciate that the TCMA has to physically power a valve closed but applying high voltage to low voltage
     <br/>
     logic circuitry might have unexpected consequences.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  The TCMA runs on the FADECs (Full Authority Digital Engine Control). There is one per engine, located inside the nacelle. Each one has a dual channel design inside, to compare computations, inputs etc. and generally provide redundancy (but I don\x92t know further details on the design/logic).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The sensors and actuators related to that engine (pressure, temperature sensors, various valves etc.) are most likely directly connected to it. The two throttle position sensors per engine are also directly cabled to it according to tdracer. No idea how other inputs like WoW and RADALT are connected. The FADECs don\x92t necessarily need much else, as apparently Autopilot etc. always move the actual thrust lever.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There must also be a communication channel back to the flight recorders. No idea if it gets thrown into a comms bus or there is direct wiring.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In terms of power, each FADEC has its own alternator driven by the engine. But there\x92s a failover connection to the AC bus of the plane. Not sure if there\x92s a physical relay keeping it disconnected in normal operations.

  In software terms, they've reused an existing function to action new functionality. Raises a couple of questions: how many other functions make use of the same N2 overspeed protection functionality; what else could cause N2 overspeed, especially on two engines simultaneously, given the outcome? (Ignoring the software maintenance problems that such secondary purposing can cause later down the road.)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I read, maybe in the preceding thread, a post from a (?) chemical additive manufacturing specialist, referring to n2 speed problems caused by one of their additives incorrectly getting to a bearing (?) and creating a metallic oxide powder and subsequent issues. (Details vague as I can't find the original post - different problem domain to this though). Are there engine lubrication maintenance tasks in a roughly 2 hour turnaround?

     In another Japanese incident, on Jan 17 2019, an ANA 787 suffered a double engine cut during landing at Osaka.
     <br/>
     There is a PPRUNE thread on it. The TCMA system was discussed therein.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Both occurrences were close to the time of Ground/Air - Air/Ground transition.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Mentioned here due to not having found reference to the Osaka case in this thread.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I draw no conclusions.

     Commanded engine cutoff - the aisle stand fuel switch sends electrical signals to the spar valve and the "High Pressure Shutoff Valve" (HPSOV) in the Fuel Metering Unit, commanding them to open/close using aircraft power. The HPSOV is solenoid controlled, and near instantaneous. The solenoid is of a 'locking' type that needs to be powered both ways (for obvious reasons, you wouldn't want a loss of electrical power to shut down the engine). The fire handle does the same thing, via different electrical paths (i.e. separate wiring).
     <br/>
     <br/>
     As I've noted previously, a complete loss of aircraft electrical power would not cause the engines to flameout (or even lose meaningful thrust) during takeoff. In the takeoff altitude envelope, 'suction feed' (I think Airbus calls it 'gravity feed') is more than sufficient to supply the engine driven fuel pumps. It's only when you get up to ~20k ft. that suction feed can become an issue - and this event happened near sea level.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Not matter what's happening on the aircraft side - pushing the thrust levers to the forward stop will give you (at least) rated takeoff power since the only thing required from the aircraft is fuel and thrust lever position (and the thrust lever position resolver is powered by the FADEC).
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The TCMA logic is designed and scrubbed so as to be quite robust - flight test data of the engine response to throttle slams is reviewed to insure there is adequate margin between the TCMA limits and the actual engine responses to prevent improper TCMA activation. Again, never say never, but a whole lot would have had to go wrong in the TCMA logic for it to have activated on this flight.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Now, if I assume the speculation that the RAT deployed is correct, I keep coming up with two potential scenarios that could explain what's known regarding this accident:
     <br/>
     1) TCMA activation shutdown the engines
     <br/>
     or
     <br/>
     2) The fuel cutoff switches were activated.
     <br/>
     I literally can come up with no other plausible scenarios.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     In all due respect to all the pilots on this forum, I really hope it wasn't TCMA. It wouldn't be the first time a mandated 'safety system' has caused an accident (it wouldn't just be Boeing and GE - TCMA was forced by the FAA and EASA to prevent a scenario that had never caused a fatal accident) - and there would be a lot embarrassing questions for all involved. But I personally know many of the people who created, validated, and certified the GEnx-1B TCMA logic - and can't imagine what they would be going through if they missed something (coincidentally, one of them was at my birthday party last weekend and inevitably we ended up talking about what we used to do at Boeing (he's also retired)). Worse, similar TCMA logic is on the GEnx-2B (747-8) - which I was personally responsible for certifying - as well as the GE90-115B and the 737 MAX Leap engine - the consequences of that logic causing this accident would be massive.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I\x92m sure this is wrong; was looking for confirmation. I read somewhere that the 787 keeps the fuel valve open by an electric driven actuator, and closes it by spring force.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I seem to remember Fred Dibner talking about how railway cars brake by draining the piston not by pressurising it, so trains will stop when supply lines break.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The electrical system updates to 787s for ADs and SBs - do any of these include software updates? For example the integer overflow causing GCU failsafe rectified under AD 2018-20-15. If so, who is writing and implementing these software updates? The original engineers? Their apprentices who had years long handovers? Or have they been outsourced and offshored? When these updates occur, does the entire system get tested and ratified or just the bit the bug fix is meant to fix? Because I\x92ve seen new bugs introduced by bug fixes in areas seemingly nothing to do with the original problem.

  TCMA itself also checks the weight-on-wheel sensors, so a bad rad-alt input alone should not cause a problem.
  <br/>
  And you need the actual deviation of actual thrust vs. commanded thrust for it to activate.

  From earlier in one of the threads, I believe the ground/air logic is a function of the airframe's processing, and fed to the FADEC/TCMA as a binary value.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is to be noted, IIRC, that only the parameters for a 74? have been given for this air/ground relationship.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  EDIT: Replace single with binary value. Binary yes/no not value say 1/0/-1 Ground/?/Air...

  Interesting thread towards the end, regarding the previous TCMA malfunction
  <b>
   on landing
  </b>
  : (pprune archived thread 617426, can\x92t post links yet)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  according to
  <a href="https://www.pprune.org/members/404945-dave-therhino" rel="nofollow">
   Dave Therhino
  </a>
  who claimed to have seen a detailed report, the TCMA would initialise the thrust contour logic when touching the ground. This was nominally not an issue, as the throttles and engine would be close to idle. However, if the reverser was briefly deployed right before weight on wheels, and then cancelled when the wheels touched, TCMA would see high thrust but throttles at idle and trigger.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But this was supposedly fixed and all FADECs updated. Plus, during take-off there should not be such large fluctuation in throttle position or thrust, so intermittent switching of ground-air-ground should not cause an issue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also, according to
  <a href="https://www.pprune.org/members/414340-tdracer" rel="nofollow">
   tdracer
  </a>
  V2 overspeed protection cuts thrust so quickly, that if it triggered (via TCMA or whatever other reason) it was likely  after the plane had lifted off the ground. I wonder though if there\x92s still enough kinetic energy to fly the profile of the incident flight with the engines cut right around rotation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also, would hydraulics go out so quickly, that wheels would not retract? Wonder if a faulty WoW sensor could be a contributing factor and would also not manifest itself as the wheels not retracting :thinking

     I have read that TCMA can not activate unless TL set to idle . How about this made up scenario . During takeoff run close to takeoff speed PF decides to reject for ANY reason and moves TL-s to idle . PM (captain ? ). Says my airplane we are continuing and move TL-s back to full trust . TCMA triggers and shuts off the fuel . I am not implying that crew did anything wrong .

  I am pretty sure that with WoW and &gt;=85 kt a throttle being pulled to idle leads to immediate max autobrake plus speed-brake/spoilers deployment. I don&rsquo;t see an option there to trigger TCMA like this but happy to learn from someone with more experience.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the Jeju thread this forum used to analyze the haze of the engines to determine if they are only flight idle (or less) vs being shut down. Can someone with enough experience do the same here, please?

  Also, a mere flight idle shouldn&rsquo;t produce an N2 drop to below the VFSG limit if said VFSG can reproducibly support flight idle for significant times and even heavy loaded ground idle (under normal circumstances).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is speculation but several have already pointed it out that while the thrust was overall and especially at the end symmetric there might have been a time window with right yaw. Could this indicate a sequential (if not staged), albeit in rapid succession &ldquo;shutdown&rdquo; of the engines?

     I have read that TCMA can not activate unless TL set to idle . How about this made up scenario . During takeoff run close to takeoff speed PF decides to reject for ANY reason and moves TL-s to idle . PM (captain ? ). Says my airplane we are continuing and move TL-s back to full trust . TCMA triggers and shuts off the fuel . I am not implying that crew did anything wrong .

  I posted a similar theory some time ago. I still think this maybe a possible cause. Hopefully it isn\x92t because if it is, it will ruin Boeing. Designing a system that has total autonomy over engine run state is hubristic to say the least.

  Hi all,
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sorry it&rsquo;s going to be a long one but seeing the level of competency here, I though it would be the perfect place to get my answers. From the precious messages read and answers received, I have a scenario to run. I am more than happy to be told wrong from point 1). I don&rsquo;t have the knowledge some of you do.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Please let me first start by saying that I am not trying to incriminate anyone. Hundreds of CRMS debriefs and accidents reports show us that unfortunately sometimes, the holes in that swiss cheese just do line up. It is far too easy for any of us, seating here, to judge any of the sequences happening in a Flight Deck. Mistakes happen, regardless of training and experience. We all do mistakes, every day, in every line of work.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  DISCLAIMER:
  <br/>
  I know that the consensus is a dual engine failure due to either TCMA bug or any sort of mecanical/software/wear and tear.
  <br/>
  I do hear a RAT (I don&rsquo;t see it though) and I do find the audio analysis quite compelling. It is at the top of my list as probable cause.
  <br/>
  I am just exploring another scenario, based on the AC&rsquo;s profile and state from grainy video and poor audio.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  1- Let&rsquo;s assume that we do all our perf calculation correctly. Is it possible that the OPT would spit up a F15/20 take off with the conditions on the day on a 787?
  <br/>
  2- If so, let&rsquo;s say we have performances for a F15/20 TO in the FMC. Now let&rsquo;s assume we select F5 for TO (not in the FMC, physically). Would there be an FMC message, or would that trigger the T/O warning on the 787? If it doesn&rsquo;t, we now potentially have an aircraft on the heavy side, with already a lift penalty on a high density altitude day.
  <br/>
  3- Please bear with me, I know so far I have made an awful lot of suppositions and assumptions. Murphy&rsquo;s law dictates that what can happen will happen albeit not on the same day. As it was answered to me by someone who was obviously seeing where I was going in a previous post, it&rsquo;s a lot of swiss cheese to line up.
  <br/>
  4- Take off roll goes on, Vr F15/20 comes and we rotate at a speed lower than we should for our actual F5 setting. My buddy calls for GEAR UP, I retract flaps to F1. Another lift penalty. Is there enough thrust now, or are we then already to deep on the back end of the drag curve ?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I do understand that this is not testable in a simulator. I am asking if someone with a 787 OPT and/or FCOM and knowledge views this scenario as possible or not (especially regarding the FMC message and the T/O warning). That is all.
  <br/>
  thanks for the help !

  *On the ground* you get into a latched state, once TCMA deploys: after activation the relays stay latched to prevent a re-runaway. A full power reset of the affected EEC channel(s) and relay logic - normally done only at the gate - is required before fuel can flow again. So you can\x92t easily relight.

  Actually TCMA will react on any significant difference between commanded thrust and actual thrust. It does not have to be idle.

  Even if it's possible - there is not enough time to do so in this phase of the flight. Doing a full restart of one engine will take 1-2min. That means it will need a couple thousand feet.

  You may be surprised to know that TCMA doesn't require that, it just requires a differential between commanded and actual thrust.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It has never triggered during takeoff until now. Maybe it still hasn't been. We'll see. Given there is an actual example of a 787 in the wild shutting down both of it's engines when it shouldn't (ANA), I'm surprised how complacent people are that this couldn't be the cause..Software can always have weird corner failures that could never have been thought of or tested.

     I am pretty sure that with WoW and &gt;=85 kt a throttle being pulled to idle leads to immediate max autobrake plus speed-brake/spoilers deployment. I don&rsquo;t see an option there to trigger TCMA like this but happy to learn from someone with more experience.
    </div>

  SLF but I think this makes sense. If pulling from takeoff thust back to idle with WoW would cause TCMA activation, we'd see engine shutdowns on every rejected takeoff.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I also wonder about this theory that one of the pilots called for reject and pulled the thrust levers back, and the other overruled him and continued the takeoff. Is this plausible? CRM aside, if max braking and spoilers are triggered in this scenario, it doesn't seem so to me.

  <br/>
  What I cannot do is add new theories or uncover any new facts the actual experts have not already thought of. However, since summarizing and structuring information is one thing lawyers tend to regularly do (and sometimes even do well), here is my attempt at a useful contribution to this thread: an attempt to summarize the main theories discussed here since day one (which I think hasn't been done for quite some time) in the hope that a birds-eye view will be helpful to those who have not read everything since the beginning or might even trigger some new flash of inspiration for someone more knowledgable than me. I have focused on the cons since there does not seem to be enough evidence to come to any positive conclusion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I shall try to be concise and to refrain from personal evaluations of my own. Of course, no disrespect whatsoever is intended towards all those who have contributed to this thread and to the individual theories, one or combinations of which may turn out to have led to this tragic outcome. That arguments can be made against every single theory that has been propagated seems to be the result of the highly improbable and unusual nature of this deplorable event and certainly not due to any lack of knowledge or reasoning skills in this forum.

   For a while, the forward tilt of the bogies as first part of the retraction cycle was seen as additional evidence that the gear had been selected up. However, it has been pointed out that the forward tilt and the opening of the gear doors occur almost simultaneously so that it seems unlikely that hydraulic power was lost in the split second between bogie tilt and gear door actuation. It is now assumed the forward tilt of the bogies was merely a consequence of the hydraulic power loss.

   It should be pointed out that the question of "RAT in or out" was for a while the most contentious in this thread.

  You may be at risk of assuming that the air/ground control logic is in some way hard-wired, as opposed to being a function of software. I don't believe we (yet) know this to be true.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  We know there has been a bug in the Generator Control Unit software (an overflowing counter) that could lead to simultaneous shut down of all generators and a total loss of all AC power (the 248 days bug).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the interests of completeness, we should perhaps also consider the possibility of some other previously-unknown software issue capable of creating an uncommanded dual engine shutdown. TCMS is the most likely candidate due to the deliberate separation of other systems from being able to achieve this outcome. The question then isn't whether there's some odd combination of input faults that would confuse TCMS into believing it were on the ground, but rather whether there's any way in which the software side could crash in such a way as to create an anomalous state within the system leading to engine failure. For instance, another overlooked software counter with an unwelcome failure mode.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Or even just a "dirty power supply" (cf all the reports of dodgy passenger-side electrics on this a/c) leading to spurious inputs and unexpected consequences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Whatever is the cause will likely turn out to be have been a very low-probability event. But unless we have a TCMS expert who can state canonically that (say) the WoW sensor electrically disables TCMS when airborne (as opposed to merely being an input to the TCMS logic) then we cannot say with certainty that multiple inputs would have to have failed / been corrupted in order to reach the end state of this flight.
