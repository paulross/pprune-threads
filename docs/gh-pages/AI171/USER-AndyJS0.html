  Apologies if already discussed but I'd be interested to know
  <span style="color:#333333">
   how common/unusual it is for a commercial aircraft to be "Stored for parts to be used on other 787's in the fleet" and then "Returned to Service"? These happened on 2019-01-23 and 2019-05-24 respectively according to this page.

     That is very clearly the revording phone autofocus struggling to focus, as in goes briefly out of focus, then on focus again.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  That's exactly what I thought. I've watched the video many times now and I can't see anything apart from the autofocus trying to focus.

     No. The investigation team will. \x91We\x92 might in 2028 perhaps. That\x92s the fundamental failing of Annex 13 and all who play by its rules now. It worked in 1980, just, but it\x92s totally unfit for purpose in 2025.

  They normally publish a preliminary report a lot sooner than 3 years after the accident as far as I know.

     The existence of the video taken from a building near the flight path adds a lot of weight, to me.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Think about living next to a flight path. I do. I never take videos of passing planes. I doubt this video-taker did either.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     But something incited him to pick up his phone (I guess) and start videoing, even before he could see the plane, which is out of view at the start. I suggest that he heard the RAT coming, knew it was totally out of the ordinary and thought it worth filming.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Why else would you film just another passing plane?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Also, looking at that video, I can see a "shadow" where the RAT would be. The RAT is very small compared with the landing gear, but there's something there. Largely lost to video compression, but it adds up.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     And I can hear it, but not on every copy of that video. Try slowing the video down, but I don't know if that's reliable.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Maybe he was a plane-spotter and was filming a lot of take-offs. We don't know this was the only one he filmed, (unless it has already been established that this was the only take-off he videoed).

  This has just appeared in the Times (of London) which is usually one of the most reliable sources of information in the UK.

  "A loss of engine power is emerging as the most likely cause of the crash of the Air India Boeing that killed at least 279 people at Ahmedabad on Thursday. The Boeing 787-8 series appeared to have suffered from lower than normal thrust from its General Electric GEnx engines as it took off and failed to climb more than 450ft before crashing, video and reports from the Indian authorities have indicated.The new information has eclipsed an early focus on the unusual configuration of the aircraft\x92s wing flaps and landing gear."

  Please delete if already posted. This is from Reuters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "India's aviation watchdog has issued a warning to Air India for "repeated and serious violations" related to pilot duty scheduling and oversight, according to government directives reviewed by Reuters on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) directed Air India to remove three company executives from crew scheduling roles - a divisional vice president, a chief manager of crew scheduling and one planning executive - for lapses linked to flights from Bengaluru to London on May 16 and May 17 that exceeded the stipulated pilot flight time limit of 10 hours."
