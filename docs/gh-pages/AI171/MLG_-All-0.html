  Still no one talking about the landing gear position?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A 787-8 with the landing gear down should have the bogey tilting upwards. Clearly in the video, the bogey is tilting downwards, which would indicate something on the aircraft is not working 100% as it should.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I know the -9 and -10 have a different landing gear retraction sequence with gear doors etc etc, but watch any normal 787-8 take off and look at the angle of the MLG bogeys and compare the the incident video.

      At this stage, at least two scenarios seem highly plausible:
     </b>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <b>
      1. Technical issue
     </b>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Airliners rely on
     <i>
      air/ground logic
     </i>
     , which is fundamental to how systems operate.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     There have been numerous crashes and serious incidents linked to this logic functioning incorrectly.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Some engineering tests require the air/ground switch to be set in a particular mode. If it's inadvertently left in engineering mode&mdash;or if the system misinterprets the mode&mdash;this can cause significant problems.
     <ul>
      <li>
       <b>
        On the ground
       </b>
       , if the aircraft is incorrectly in
       <i>
        air mode
       </i>
       , some systems may be unavailable&mdash;such as wheel brakes, reverse thrust, or ground spoilers.
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       <b>
        In the air
       </b>
       , if the aircraft is mistakenly in
       <i>
        ground mode
       </i>
       , flaps might auto-retract, and various layers of system protection may be disabled.
       <br/>
      </li>
     </ul>
     In the case of the ANA 787, it appears the engine shutdown occurred during the landing roll, possibly when the TCMA system activated.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <b>
      2. Pilot misselection of fuel control switches to cutoff
     </b>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     This is still a very real possibility. If it occurred, the pilot responsible may not have done it consciously&mdash;his mindset could have been in a different mode.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     There&rsquo;s precedent: an A320 pilot once inadvertently shut down both engines over Paris. Fortunately, the crew managed to restart them. Afterward, the pilot reportedly couldn&rsquo;t explain his actions.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     If something similar happened here, then when the pilots realized the engines had stopped producing thrust, pushing the levers forward would have had no effect. It&rsquo;s easy to overlook that the fuel switches are in the wrong position&mdash;they're far from the normal scan pattern. And with the ground rushing up, the view outside would&rsquo;ve been far more commanding.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Speaking personally, when I shut down engines at the end of a flight, I consciously force myself to operate each fuel switch
     <i>
      independently
     </i>
     and with full attention. I avoid building muscle memory that might lead to switching off both engines in a fast, well-practiced habit.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     If this is a technical issue, I assume we&rsquo;ll know soon enough.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  On item 1, the TCMA issue should have been fixed, it does fit the sort of issue that occurred here. TDRACER can talk to that, and has done in 2019 and again in post 792. As to flap auto retraction, the B787 like all Boeings has a gated flap lever, and the flaps are only able to move independent of the lever by flap load relief. That would not have caused a loss of thrust, and in this case it is evident that the event is a thrust loss not a CL loss.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On item 2, the video shows no asymmetry at any time, so there is only a symmetric failure of the engines possible. Back on a B747 classic, you could chop all 4 engines at the same time with one hand, on a B737, also, not so much on a B777 or B787. I would doubt that anyone used two hands to cut the fuel at screen height. Note, there was a B744 that lost one engine in cruise when a clip board fell off the coaming. Didn't happen twice, and it only happened to one engine.

     Yes indeed, the moment they pulled the gear lever, as we see the gear begin the retraction process, and then suddenly stop. Almost as if they suddenly lost power.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     We can see the landing gear retraction process begin. We see the bogies tilted in the second video. We can hear the RAT. We can see the RAT. We can see the flaps extended in the video and at the crash site. There isn't actually a single piece of evidence the flaps were raised, it's just a conclusion people jumped too before evidence began to emerge.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The crazy thing is, when the report comes out and there is no mention of flaps none of the people who have been pushing the flap theory will self reflect or learn anything. They'll think those of us who didn't buy into it were just lucky, rather than it being down to use of fairly simple critical thinking.

  Neila83 is correct, the gear tilt pre retraction is rear wheels low, and at the commencement of the selection of the retraction cycle (generally),
  <strike>
   the first thing that happens is the inboard MLG doors start to open below the wheel well and then the bogie is driven to front wheels low.
  </strike>
  (There is also an option that the inboard gear doors start to open early as a result of WOW sensing to improve the SSL climb limit). [my bad, for the B788 Capt Bloggs informs us the gear door sequence is after the tilt, not before, the B789 has the before tilt, the option for the door open at rotate is separate]
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <strike>
   The inboard doors do not appear to have opened in this case, yet, the gear is forward wheels down. This appears to be out of sequence. TD may have better knowledge on the options that exist with the B788, but this is not looking good at this time.
  </strike>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There is enough in the way of anomalies here to end up with regulatory action, and airlines themselves should/will be starting to pore over their systems and decide if they are comfortable with the airworthiness of the aircraft at this moment. A latent single point of failure is not a comfortable place to be. Inhibiting TCMA might be a good interim option, that system could have been negated by having the
  <b>
   ATR ARM switches....(Both)... ARM
  </b>
  deferred to the before takeoff checks. The EAFR recovery should result in action within the next 24-48 hours. Boeing needs to be getting their tiger teams warmed up, they can ill afford to have a latent system fault discovered that is not immediately responded to, and the general corporate response of
  <i>
   "blame the pilots"
  </i>
  is not likely to win any future orders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I think we are about to have some really busy days for the OEM.

     I believe the gear remained down not because of mis-selection but because of a major distraction on rotate.

  How would you account for the front-wheel-down angle of the MLG bogies, clearly visible in the flyover video?

     I've been closely examining a video frame captured very early in the footage depicting the aircraft's final moments. In this particular frame, I believe the
     <b>
      left main landing gear (MLG) door is clearly visible in the open position
     </b>
     , while the
     <b>
      right MLG door appears closed
     </b>
     . Additionally, both
     <b>
      main gear bogies are noticeably tilted forward
     </b>
     \x97 a configuration that typically occurs at the initiation of the gear retraction sequence.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     This combination strongly suggests that a
     <b>
      gear retraction was commanded
     </b>
     , but the
     <b>
      sequence was interrupted and never completed
     </b>
     . What\x92s particularly striking is the
     <b>
      asymmetry
     </b>
     \x97 the left door open, the right door closed \x97 which should not occur during normal operations and points toward a possible
     <b>
      hydraulic failure scenario
     </b>
     during retraction.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     As many will know, on the Boeing 787-8,
     <b>
      each main gear door is hydraulically actuated and powered by its respective side\x92s hydraulic system
     </b>
     \x97 the
     <b>
      left gear door by the left hydraulic system
     </b>
     , and the
     <b>
      right by the right
     </b>
     . This leads me to propose the following hypothesis:
     <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
      <li>
       Shortly after rotation, with a positive rate of climb established, the
       <b>
        flight crew commands gear up
       </b>
       .
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       The
       <b>
        gear retraction sequence initiates
       </b>
       ; the
       <b>
        main gear bogies tilt forward
       </b>
       , consistent with the start of retraction.
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       <b>
        The right engine fails first
       </b>
       , resulting in a
       <b>
        loss of right hydraulic system pressure
       </b>
       . Consequently, the
       <b>
        right MLG door does not open
       </b>
       .
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       The
       <b>
        left MLG door, still powered by the left hydraulic system, opens
       </b>
       .
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       <b>
        Moments later, the left engine also fails
       </b>
       , leading to
       <b>
        loss of the left hydraulic system
       </b>
       . With the door now open but no remaining hydraulic pressure,
       <b>
        the left main gear remains extended and the door remains open
       </b>
       .
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       The
       <b>
        ram air turbine (RAT) deploys
       </b>
       , consistent with total engine and electrical power loss.
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       With the
       <b>
        loss of thrust from both engines
       </b>
       , the aircraft loses lift and enters an unrecoverable descent, tragically ending in impact.
       <br/>
      </li>
     </ol>
     This sequence would explain the
     <b>
      partially completed gear retraction
     </b>
     and the
     <b>
      asymmetric gear door position
     </b>
     observed in the video evidence. It\x92s worth noting that the timing of the hydraulic losses would have to be
     <b>
      very close together
     </b>
     \x97 potentially within seconds \x97 which aligns with a
     <b>
      dual engine failure shortly after take-off
     </b>
     . In such a scenario,
     <b>
      asymmetric thrust would be minimal or non-existent
     </b>
     , making the aircraft\x92s attitude appear otherwise stable in its descent.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Further supporting this theory are:
     <ul>
      <li>
       <b>
        Eyewitness reports of a loud bang
       </b>
       , possibly indicating an engine failure.
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       A
       <b>
        mayday call
       </b>
       reportedly made by the crew.
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       The
       <b>
        audible presence of the RAT
       </b>
       in the video, suggesting a complete loss of engine-driven electrical and hydraulic systems.
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       The
       <b>
        noticeable absence of typical engine noise
       </b>
       , supporting the hypothesis of dual engine failure.
       <br/>
      </li>
     </ul>
     This scenario would offer a tragically plausible explanation for the aircraft\x92s behavior and the observed configuration in its final moments. Of course, the
     <b>
      official investigation will provide the definitive answers

     Unfortunately this is my first post here. I wanted to upload the frame for all to see but the forum is restricting me from doing this until I reach 8 posts. I can't link to it via a URL either. I studied a frame from the very start of the video, just as the full aircraft enters view and expanded it by 400% allowing me to see the position of the MLG doors).

  I have no knowledge about 787, but every landing gear system I\x92ve worked with did not sequence Left and Right MLG to retract and extend with each other. In fact it is typical for left and right side to move at slightly different speed due to different friction etc. Retraction assymmetry is probably not a clue to this mystery.

  The post you are replying to is completely wrong.
  <br/>
  The 787 landing gear is operated by the centre hydraulic system's two electric pumps.
  <br/>
  I have no idea why they have posted such nonsense.

  Combining all the bits and pieces of info from this thread so far, IMO we can theoretically sequence it thus using the video from the left:

  00:18 Rotation. Normal takeoff config.
  <br/>
  00:24 Gear up starts. per Raffael with FF.

  ......... ? Full power flameout leaves N2 ~ 60%; Airspeed &lt; 200k so N2 will decay to 15% in 8-10s?
  <br/>
  ......... ? Takeoff EGT of 900C needs 25-35s to fall below 250C ?
  <br/>
  00:27 Gear up stops. per Raffael with FF. Bogies tilted.
  <br/>
  ......... ? APU starts. 20-55s to 95%N?
  <br/>
  ......... Per 787 dual-engine fail/stall memory items, PM initiates Fuel Cutoff and Run.
  <br/>
  00:28 Visible loss of thrust. Alt ~ 200ft using aircraft wingspan as measure.
  <br/>
  ......... Matches with eyewitness "within 5-10s ... it was stuck in the air".
  <br/>
  ......... Per 787 dual-engine fail/stall memory items, PM initiates RAT Switch for 1s. Whether auto or manual, the RAT initiates.
  <br/>
  ......... RAT "bang" heard by survivor
  <br/>
  ......... RAT coming online accounts for eyewitness "lights started flickering green and white".
  <br/>
  ......... Per 787 QRH below 1000ft, PF makes no change to Main Landing Gear and flaps, aircraft pointed straight for best glide.
  <br/>
  00:31 Descending visibly, somewhere beyond the runway threshold. Alt ~ 200ft using aircraft wingspan as measure.
  <br/>
  ......... ? Because EGT &gt; 250C FADEC blocks fuel (T-HOT hot restart inhibit?) so no relight though N2 &gt; 15% ?
  <br/>
  ......... 787 glide ratio between 16:1 to 25:1 with MLG down, Flaps 5. About 15-20s and 3-5000ft of glide from 200ft?
  <br/>
  ......... Some flap accounts for the ground pictures.
  <br/>
  00:34 ? N2 has presumably decayed to 15%, FADEC flips to X-START: airspeed outside envelope? No hope of relight now.
  <br/>

  00:46 APU reaches some fraction of 95%N (APU sound accounting for survivor's perception of thrust?).

  There should not be a max pre-start EGT limit in-flight - that should only occur on the ground for a pilot-initiated Autostart where the starting EGT redlines are lower than for in-flight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In-flight, the Autorelight function should attempt to restart the engine as soon as a flameout is detected, and for an engine flaming out at high power it might catch it before it even goes sub-idle.  Generally, Autorelight will continue attempting until some cutoff N2 at which time it will stop attempting, or if the pilot move the fuel switch to Cutoff.  And while the EEC is still powered (via its own PMA) down to roughly 10% N2, the ignition exciters required for Autorelight do get their power from the airplane.

   Flaps Retracted Instead of MLG

 <hr/>

 <div id="post_message_11902254">
  My initial thoughts were the same as yours that the flaps were retracted instead of the MLG. I therefore surmised that the PF instructed the PNF to retract the MLG after take off and that because his experience was mainly on Airbus aircraft, he mistakenly moved the B787 flaps lever to fully retracted instead of the MLG lever. To this end I studied the layouts of the B787 and Airbus A320 consoles to see if that might explain this basic error. I discovered that the B787 Flaps lever is just to the right of the B787's single screen and that the A320's MLG lever is also just to the right of the lower screen. I therefore consider it possible that without thinking, the PNF pushed the Flaps lever up to fully retracted imagining that he was retracting the MLG. I apologize for not providing images but I am not allowed to do that until I have submitted at least 8 posts.

     Then the gear.
     <br/>
     When you lift off the runway, the gear doors open REGARDLESS of gear lever position. If you do not raise the gear within 30 seconds, the gear doors close again and you keep the gear down as you apparently desire. In the video, the gear doors are closed again as the airplane flies into the suburb. This requires normal hydraulics in system C, which was apprently available as the doors are closed again..

  Incorrect. Aircraft is a 787-8. It is does not have the early MLG door opening feature fitted to 787-9 &amp; -10.

  Well I am sorry but they don&rsquo;t.

  This yt video is somewhat cheesy, but it should make the -9 &ldquo;early open&rdquo; MLG door process clear to you, in a normal gear retraction. Unless you think this clown selected gear up on the ground.
  <br/>
  They cycle open before gear is selected up (&amp; even if gear is left down as you observed). Whereas on the -8 MLG doors will not budge until gear is selected up.

      At this stage, at least two scenarios seem highly plausible:
     </b>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <b>
      1. Technical issue
     </b>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Airliners rely on
     <i>
      air/ground logic
     </i>
     , which is fundamental to how systems operate.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     There have been numerous crashes and serious incidents linked to this logic functioning incorrectly.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Some engineering tests require the air/ground switch to be set in a particular mode. If it's inadvertently left in engineering mode&mdash;or if the system misinterprets the mode&mdash;this can cause significant problems.
     <ul>
      <li>
       <b>
        On the ground
       </b>
       , if the aircraft is incorrectly in
       <i>
        air mode
       </i>
       , some systems may be unavailable&mdash;such as wheel brakes, reverse thrust, or ground spoilers.
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       <b>
        In the air
       </b>
       , if the aircraft is mistakenly in
       <i>
        ground mode
       </i>
       , flaps might auto-retract, and various layers of system protection may be disabled.
       <br/>
      </li>
     </ul>
     In the case of the ANA 787, it appears the engine shutdown occurred during the landing roll, possibly when the TCMA system activated.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <b>
      2. Pilot misselection of fuel control switches to cutoff
     </b>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     This is still a very real possibility. If it occurred, the pilot responsible may not have done it consciously&mdash;his mindset could have been in a different mode.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     There&rsquo;s precedent: an A320 pilot once inadvertently shut down both engines over Paris. Fortunately, the crew managed to restart them. Afterward, the pilot reportedly couldn&rsquo;t explain his actions.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     If something similar happened here, then when the pilots realized the engines had stopped producing thrust, pushing the levers forward would have had no effect. It&rsquo;s easy to overlook that the fuel switches are in the wrong position&mdash;they're far from the normal scan pattern. And with the ground rushing up, the view outside would&rsquo;ve been far more commanding.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Speaking personally, when I shut down engines at the end of a flight, I consciously force myself to operate each fuel switch
     <i>
      independently
     </i>
     and with full attention. I avoid building muscle memory that might lead to switching off both engines in a fast, well-practiced habit.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     If this is a technical issue, I assume we&rsquo;ll know soon enough.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  On item 1, the TCMA issue should have been fixed, it does fit the sort of issue that occurred here. TDRACER can talk to that, and has done in 2019 and again in post 792. As to flap auto retraction, the B787 like all Boeings has a gated flap lever, and the flaps are only able to move independent of the lever by flap load relief. That would not have caused a loss of thrust, and in this case it is evident that the event is a thrust loss not a CL loss.
  <br/>

  On item 2, the video shows no asymmetry at any time, so there is only a symmetric failure of the engines possible. Back on a B747 classic, you could chop all 4 engines at the same time with one hand, on a B737, also, not so much on a B777 or B787. I would doubt that anyone used two hands to cut the fuel at screen height. Note, there was a B744 that lost one engine in cruise when a clip board fell off the coaming. Didn't happen twice, and it only happened to one engine.

     Yes indeed, the moment they pulled the gear lever, as we see the gear begin the retraction process, and then suddenly stop. Almost as if they suddenly lost power.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     We can see the landing gear retraction process begin. We see the bogies tilted in the second video. We can hear the RAT. We can see the RAT. We can see the flaps extended in the video and at the crash site. There isn't actually a single piece of evidence the flaps were raised, it's just a conclusion people jumped too before evidence began to emerge.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The crazy thing is, when the report comes out and there is no mention of flaps none of the people who have been pushing the flap theory will self reflect or learn anything. They'll think those of us who didn't buy into it were just lucky, rather than it being down to use of fairly simple critical thinking.

  Neila83 is correct, the gear tilt pre retraction is rear wheels low, and at the commencement of the selection of the retraction cycle (generally),
  <strike>
   the first thing that happens is the inboard MLG doors start to open below the wheel well and then the bogie is driven to front wheels low.
  </strike>
  (There is also an option that the inboard gear doors start to open early as a result of WOW sensing to improve the SSL climb limit). [my bad, for the B788 Capt Bloggs informs us the gear door sequence is after the tilt, not before, the B789 has the before tilt, the option for the door open at rotate is separate]
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <strike>
   The inboard doors do not appear to have opened in this case, yet, the gear is forward wheels down. This appears to be out of sequence. TD may have better knowledge on the options that exist with the B788, but this is not looking good at this time.
  </strike>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There is enough in the way of anomalies here to end up with regulatory action, and airlines themselves should/will be starting to pore over their systems and decide if they are comfortable with the airworthiness of the aircraft at this moment. A latent single point of failure is not a comfortable place to be. Inhibiting TCMA might be a good interim option, that system could have been negated by having the
  <b>
   ATR ARM switches....(Both)... ARM
  </b>
  deferred to the before takeoff checks. The EAFR recovery should result in action within the next 24-48 hours. Boeing needs to be getting their tiger teams warmed up, they can ill afford to have a latent system fault discovered that is not immediately responded to, and the general corporate response of
  <i>
   "blame the pilots"
  </i>
  is not likely to win any future orders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I think we are about to have some really busy days for the OEM.

     Then the gear.
     <br/>
     When you lift off the runway, the gear doors open REGARDLESS of gear lever position. If you do not raise the gear within 30 seconds, the gear doors close again and you keep the gear down as you apparently desire. In the video, the gear doors are closed again as the airplane flies into the suburb. This requires normal hydraulics in system C, which was apprently available as the doors are closed again..

  Incorrect. Aircraft is a 787-8. It is does not have the early MLG door opening feature fitted to 787-9 &amp; -10.

  This yt video is somewhat cheesy, but it should make the -9 &ldquo;early open&rdquo; MLG door process clear to you, in a normal gear retraction. Unless you think this clown selected gear up on the ground.

  They cycle open before gear is selected up (&amp; even if gear is left down as you observed). Whereas on the -8 MLG doors will not budge until gear is selected up.

     May or may not be relevant, many years ago on a B 737 -300 taking off from Perth Australia with a ground temp of over 40C the ground/air switch failed. The a/c thought it was on the ground even though we were climbing away. Gear would not retract, sploilers kept trying to disarm and t/off warning horns sounding and could not be silenced. I wonder if this could be a factor! Thoughts are with the families involved.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  The Air/Ground system on the Classic was/is a long way from the 787, I have experienced the same issue on the -400 in the dim and distant past and in essence it comes down to the fact the A/G sensor on the (right?) MLG. The issue was remedied on the NG with multiple other sensors so I cannot imagine that it would remain on the 787 - particularly given the additional need to have a very robust air/ground sense for the flight control laws.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As an aside I\x92d never be able to cheat the NG like I did the Classic - touch down left wing low to stop all the spoilers deploying and it slumping onto the deck, so it\x92s probably for the best I never flew it

   DISCLAIMER: Poster (a) is one of the (apparently quite numerous) lawyers following this thread; (b) a long-time forum lurker and aviation enthusiast who loves studying FCOMs for fun (to each his own, I guess); (c) has followed and read this thread from the start.

  What I cannot do is add new theories or uncover any new facts the actual experts have not already thought of. However, since summarizing and structuring information is one thing lawyers tend to regularly do (and sometimes even do well), here is my attempt at a useful contribution to this thread: an attempt to summarize the main theories discussed here since day one (which I think hasn't been done for quite some time) in the hope that a birds-eye view will be helpful to those who have not read everything since the beginning or might even trigger some new flash of inspiration for someone more knowledgable than me. I have focused on the cons since there does not seem to be enough evidence to come to any positive conclusion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I shall try to be concise and to refrain from personal evaluations of my own. Of course, no disrespect whatsoever is intended towards all those who have contributed to this thread and to the individual theories, one or combinations of which may turn out to have led to this tragic outcome. That arguments can be made against every single theory that has been propagated seems to be the result of the highly improbable and unusual nature of this deplorable event and certainly not due to any lack of knowledge or reasoning skills in this forum.

    strong indications that hydraulic and electric power were lost (audible/visible indications of RAT extension, survivor statement, lack of engine noise, position of MLG bogies).

   For a while, the forward tilt of the bogies as first part of the retraction cycle was seen as additional evidence that the gear had been selected up. However, it has been pointed out that the forward tilt and the opening of the gear doors occur almost simultaneously so that it seems unlikely that hydraulic power was lost in the split second between bogie tilt and gear door actuation. It is now assumed the forward tilt of the bogies was merely a consequence of the hydraulic power loss.

  I like everyone else have no evidence that TMCA played a role but given that it is one of the few systems with the ability to cut fuel to the engines, here are some thoughts on how signal processing could have extended the window of when TMCA could bite. In particular, I'm looking at the time immediately after the nose lifts up when something may have physically shifted onboard.
  <br/>
  I'll phrase it as a number of questions but realise that the few people who can answer may not be able to for now.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thanks to tdracer's explanation on TMCA (albeit 747 not 787), we know that TMCA is a logic block within the FADEC whose only external inputs are a logic signal fron the aircraft that indicates whether it is on the ground or not and throttle position as determined by two independent resolvers per throttle side.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The logic would seem to be something of the form
  <br/>
  If (G AND (N2&gt;A OR N2&gt;B)) Then CutOffFuel()
  <br/>
  where G is true when the aircraft is on the ground,
  <br/>
  A is an envelope defined by throttle resolver channel A and
  <br/>
  B is an envelope defined by throttle resolver channel B
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Q1: Am I correct in that assumption that when on the ground, overspeed with respect to EITHER resolver A OR resolver B can trigger TMCA?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  We have been told that the logic (ie true or false) signal G is determined from the Weight-on-wheels sensors and the RadALT. It is reasonable to suppose that the designers still wanted TMCA to function after a hard landing where some landing gear components had failed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Q2: When the nosewheel lifts off but the MLG is still on the ground and RadALT is close to ground, will G still be true?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Next, it is common when data fusing multiple inputs that there is a desire to clean up a signal before it is sampled digitally. This can remove effects such as switch bounce. The inclusion of low pass filters or hysteresis will generally add a propogation delay.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Q3: Is there a slow filter (Tc&gt;=1s) in the ground/air logic which could have caused a slight delay before G became false after takeoff further extending the opportunity of TMCA to activate?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Q4: Does TMCA act almost instantly or does it wait for the fault condition to stay asserted for a period of time before acting?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At that point, the total energy of the system would have comprised of the kinetic energy of the aircraft travelling at Vr, the rotational inertia of the engines and the potential energy of whatever fuel is beyond the cutoff valves.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Q5: Would this total energy have been sufficient to get the aircraft 100ft into the air?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It would still need a mechanism for at least one throttle input to each FADEC to misbehave at the same time. Resolvers are fed with an excitation signal to the rotor and take back two orthogonal signals (Cos and Sin) from stator windings. Usually, the excitation comes directly from the resolver-to-digital (R2D) circuit but sometimes an external signal source is used. I would hope that in an aircraft system, each channel would be kept independent of everything else.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Q6: Does the excitation signal for the 4 throttle resolvers (2 per side) come from 4 independent (internal) sources?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  My last thought for a single point of failure between both throttles would be a short between two wires or connection points carrying resolver signals, one from each side. Whether this could be caused by swarf wearing within a wiring loom, a foreign object moving about, crushed wires or even stretching of adjacent wires, I have absolutely no idea.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Q7: Do resolver signals from left or right, either channel A or B, run next to each other in a loom at any point?

     I like everyone else have no evidence that TMCA played a role but given that it is one of the few systems with the ability to cut fuel to the engines, here are some thoughts on how signal processing could have extended the window of when TMCA could bite. In particular, I'm looking at the time immediately after the nose lifts up when something may have physically shifted onboard.

  Ahah! Logic raises the questions.

  What happens when the 2 disparate processes that form TCMA disagree?

  Yes, overspeed on either resolver channel A or B alone will trip the TMCA fuel-cut logic

  G is a single Boolean that FADEC derives from Weight-On-Wheels (MLG and NW) and radio-altimeter. Iit stays \x93ground\x94 until all WOW sensors go inactive (i.e.
  <i>
   every
  </i>
  wheel is off the runway) and the RadALT exceeds its airborne threshold.

  That's very unlikely. Ground/air logic uses small hysteresis (tens to a few hundred ms), but not in the multi-second range

  Let's do the math very quickly:
  <br/>
  Kinetic energy with a weight of 200,000kg, at Vr = 150kn = 77m/s: E_kin = 600MJ
  <br/>
  Rotational energy of a GEnX engine is hard to calculate as I don't find reliable values for the rotary inertia. I found some for a GE90 and could roughly estimate 100MJ of rotational energy for each engine. However, I seriously doubt that this energy could be effectively used to gain thrust, as the thrust will drop very quicjkly after the fuel is cut off.
  <br/>
  the required potential energy for a 100ft climb of a 200,000kg 787 is around 70MJ.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This ignores aerodynamic drag, still, 100 ft of climb remains energetically feasible.
  <br/>
  However, it as been pointed out several times that the actual climb was higher than 100ft. Already for 200ft I would doubt the validity of my statement above.
