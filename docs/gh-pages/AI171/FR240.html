  Ground tracking on FR24 is often not accurate, taxing aircraft can often disappear and the software simply joins the dots when they turn up again.

  FR24 coverage (and any other ADS-B system) is poor at VAAH. Attached a 24h coverage plot. You'll note that the backtrack section of the runway has practically nil coverage, so they may well have backtracked but it didn't show up on ADS-B.

  Don't rely on the FR24 trace. A look at the last few AI171 departures off 23 all show the same - no use of full length - strongly suggesting that that is an FR24 artefact.

  I am not familiar with the 787, but to achieve only a few hundred feet from an 11500 feet runway does not sound good. Even an engine fail at V1 should give you screen height at the end of the TODA, followed by a further rate of climb, but that would require the gear to be up.

  I'm glad FR24 clarified that. FR24 isn't always accurate. Only yesterday I was on a flight out of Milan. For fun I followed it on FR24 with my sons. At first it was normal but soon we taxyed across the main road and into the forest before returning to the taxyway and taking off from it. Clearly it can't be trusted.
  <br/>
  So it should not be relied on.

  Air India is not allowed to use intersection departure by their SOP. I think that should clear any doubts on this theory.

  No, the FR24 ADS-B data is accurate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's the conclusions that people have jumped to while ignoring the fact that there's a 4\xbd minute gap in the data that have turned out to be incorrect.

  <br/>
  I can't post the image of the FR24 data, but the granular data points show a 14kt loss of speed from 21' to 71'. With all engines operating, or even with one engine failed, the speed would be increasing or at least remain constant through this period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Additionally, the CCTV footage from beside the runway shows a ballistic flight trajectory from liftoff to impact.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  184kts is a very high rotate speed (a common OPT output) and the aircraft has a lot of excess energy at that point. With Flaps 5 and no thrust it could trade airspeed for altitude at approx 14kts per 50' until about 250'AGL before running out of puff.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Again, that is consistent with the video.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It looks to me like it lost all thrust at some point in the rotation.

  There isn't enough clarity on numerous issues, and without answers to the following, zero conclusions can be made as to a possible cause. This is definitely one that could go in numerous directions. Anyone claiming to have the definitive answers must have the FDR data, and I'm assuming that shouldn't take too long to be located and analysed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  1a. Were flaps deployed at start of take off roll?
  <br/>
  1b. Were flaps retracted coinciding with climb rate reduction?
  <br/>
  2. Did the RAT definitely deploy? The videos are grainy low quality. AI improvement surely isn't reliable.
  <br/>
  3. If the RAT deployed, would that indicate complete power loss?
  <br/>
  4. Was there any other audio indicating thrust loss or variations during departure?
  <br/>
  5. Can we confirm the pilot Mayday indicating thrust loss? If so, that needs investigation as a first priority. The pilot was telling us the cause. Unless we have alternative information he should be believed.
  <br/>
  6. Why was the gear not retracted? Distraction, hydraulic failure, flap instead of gear, intentionally, the possibilities are endless.
  <br/>
  7. If complete thrust loss occurred, other than a severe fuel issue, what could cause simultaneous flameout? That would be almost unimaginable, yet this is what the pilot allergy said happened. It would have massive ramifications if that gets confirmed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I don't think the video clips we have are clear enough to say anything at all at this stage. Flaps are hard to see on 787 imo for departure settings. All I can say is it appeared to climb well in the first seconds, then coinciding with the point that gear would usually be retracted, lift appears to very quickly be lost. That indicates sudden speed loss, or lift loss. Speed loss would be thrust, lift loss would be flap retraction if thrust was still available.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pilot allegedly reported thrust loss, that should be highest on the list of causes imo. In the case of double engine failure without any apparent outside influence visible on videos, that would be quite something for investigators to fathom.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I don't know if anyone has data to show speed trend at the point the aircraft starts to descend, or a better audio for thrust variations at that point. I'm guessing that the update frequency on FR24 would be too slow to show that sudden change at the highest point achieved.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  We'll have the answers soon enough, all I can say is there appears to be no clear answers here without the data recorders or clear improved information. Indeed no conclusions whatsoever can be made as to crew actions either.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  RIP crew and passengers, condolences to the families.

  FR24 data appears to stop shortly after airborne but well before impact.
  <br/>
  That would seem to align with the significant loss of electrics as a result of loss of engine generators theory?
  <br/>
  Flaps prematurely retracted shouldn\x92t be a cause of loss of electrical power to the transponder.  If electrical power was normal then one would have expected data info until impact, regardless of flap position.

       the lift-off speed implied here, seems extremely high

       just after lift-off, speed is decreasing rapidly

  Not a 787 pilot, but given the fairly high weight, calm winds and the 37C temperature, 184kn is not excessivly high for rotation.  The data points are ground speed and a small decrease during initial climb doesn't seem surprising.  It isn't "decreasing rapidly", it just drops a few knots.  Simple geometry plus some small variance in airspeed and wind would account for that much variance and FR24 calculated speeds are not perfect in any case.  I think it is more interesting that the data stops shortly thereafter.  If the speed continued to decrease that would be an important clue, but we don't have that information right now.  The surveillance video seems to me to show the plane at least exceeding a full wingspan in height, that means over 200 feet.

     If you rotated and then lost all power wouldn't you put the nose down?
    </div>
   </div>

  Yes, this is the odd part - from the videos it didn't look like there was any attempt to put the nose down for best glide, and even the pitch up (if presumably from fear) was not very pronounced. It basically came down in the same attitude as during the takeoff. That has me wondering if they even had any controls at all. Very low probability, true, but then both engines out is also a low probability event. 'RAT Push and hold 1 second' seems to be a dual-engine fail memory item on a 787, so both engines out would explain the loss of thrust and the RAT deployment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The lack of obvious debris/smoke during takeoff might indicate it was something other than a birdstrike, and combined with the loss of adsb (per FR24) right over the runway threshold at 70ft agl, maybe it is indicative of something else causing the simultaneous loss of thrust.
