     Where does that put the loss of thrust theory?
     <br>
      <br>
       Above quote from article in today\x92s Daily Telegraph
       <br>
        <br>
         (Current 777 Captain)
        </br>

  I watched the NYT video version of the survivor interview in hospital. He is speaking in an Indian language, with a caption in English. Assuming the translation is accurate, he says he "I could feel the engine thrust increasing to go up, but it crashed with speed into the building".
  <br>
   <br>
    &ZeroWidthSpace;&ZeroWidthSpace;&ZeroWidthSpace;&ZeroWidthSpace;&ZeroWidthSpace;&ZeroWidthSpace;&ZeroWidthSpace;Note "feel", rather than "hear". Ordinarily you would first be aware of the sound of the engines spooling up, before you felt acceleration. Possibly he was subject to a somatogravic illusion as the plane accelerated downwards.
    <br>
     <br/>
     But if indeed the engines were spooling up, the question is, from what thrust level? They could have rolled back, and somehow were recovering. of their own accord or from pilot action.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     All this is hanging on a pretty fine thread,

    The analysis suggests that the plane likely extended its wing flaps and slats before takeoff, used adequate runway distance, and took off from a typical point with a relatively normal initial ascent.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Within seconds of takeoff, however, the landing gear retraction process appears to have failed, and the plane&rsquo;s emergency power generator was likely deployed....
    <br/>
    <br/>
    &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t see any kind of indication of asymmetric thrust. You don&rsquo;t see yawing, you don&rsquo;t see rudder deflection, you don&rsquo;t see smoke, or puffs of flame from either engine,&rdquo; said Jeff Guzzetti, a former accident investigator for the Federal Aviation Administration. &ldquo;That all adds up to me to be a symmetrical loss of power.&rdquo;

  Yeah, that's a concern that one can do nothing about, but I recall Egypt Air 990 having that same sort of obstacle to the investigation (cultural/political). (No, I am

  saying that the causes are the same). My point is that each nation's transparency varies, regardless of what ICAO calls for.

     There is absolutely nothing unusual about the 787 arrangement in this regard.
    </div>
   </div>

  Unless one is on PPRuNe, a haven for the garden variety Boeing-basher. (Though at times B seem to bring it on themselves...)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From two threads I see this: a sudden loss of thrust was the initiating event after a successful take off - all of this other electronic stuff was a result of that.
  <br/>
  What I will be paying close attention to is what information comes out as regards maintenance and ground handling for that particular hull...and what isn't said. (I guess that may be a while in coming - and I do agree in the general sense that giving the benefit of the doubt is a good position to take at this point in time).

  Article seemed quite objective and avoided speculation of the cause. But the audio they included of the airliner flying overhead with RAT deployed seemed to be from the older video of another 787 where RAT was confirmed out rather than from the actual Ahmedabad crash footage?
