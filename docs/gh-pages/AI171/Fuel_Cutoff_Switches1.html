     Question is why both engines lost power . Foreign object ingestion , contaminated fuel or both cutoff levels operated ? We do not know .
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Any autothrust discussion is misleading since every pilot in that situation will firewall the levers whatever thrust reduction was selected for TO . the same is true for the RAT discussion- if enough hydraulic pressure was generated or not . The plane pitched up last second so there obviously was control until the end . Of course , without energy pulling alone will not bring you anywhere .
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Why did both engines fail the same second as they would be cut off ???
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  <br/>
  Actually not true. Remember the 737 with iced up itt probes that hit the Washington bridge?
  <br/>
  a simple \x93yugga\x94 on the power levers would have prevented disaster.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  probably irrelevant to this topic however

     Impossible. The switches are guarded. You need to pull them out to move them to Cutoff.

  Exactly like the action of lifting the flap lever out of detent before moving it.  What is significantly different is that you would have to do it twice.  It is that which makes it improbable unless intentional.

     We're all shouting each other down with two main different theories on why the aircraft lost lift so shortly after takeoff.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     1) Incorrect flap retraction causing the aircraft to lose lift and unable to recover the energy in time. (Not unheard of and plenty of reports where this has happened - albeit usually not to a crash).
     <br/>
     <br/>
     2) Loss of engine thrust backed up two potential pieces of evidence that back up the RAT was deployed (apparent RAT sound, potential RAT seen on low res video).
     <br/>
     <br/>
     It is impossible to know which of these is the case. Considering this summary of memory items is there the potential for a combination of both theories to have taken place?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Inadvertant flap retraction by PNF leading the PF to sense a sink and loss of lift. Pushes the thrust levers forward to the firewall and still the aircraft sinks. PF looking through the HUD and so very much 'outside focused' and doesn't realise that PNF has instead moved the flaps. PF defaults to memory items for loss of thrust on both engines before PNF can realise or communicate to PF what they've done, start switches are cut off which drops the RAT and from that point they're only heading one way. This would satisfy the strongly held belief that the RAT was extended, whilst also following the more likely initial cause of an action slip by PNF starting the sequence, rather than a dual engine failure.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Why the need to make the two theories fit in such a convoluted manner? Inadvertent flap retraction was theorised because people assumed that was most likely to have caused the loss of lift - hardly anyone believed dual engine failure was possible. Now we know that the loss of lift was indeed almost certainly caused by a loss of engine power, why all these awkward attempts to reverse engineer it to still fit the flap retraction theory? People need to realise they are only trying to make the flap retraction theory fit because of cognitive biases. If we had all been told immediately, there was dual power loss and the RAT deployed, no-one would even be considering flaps. Its confirmation bias of past assumptions, that's all.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As has been said many times as well, the landing gear retraction process appears to start as the bogies tilt, and then suddenly stops. Which rather suggests they did pull the gear lever. Based on the videos and the amount of speed the plane lost in the very brief sequence ovents, I'd say that the plane lost power a lot earlier than it would have in your theory.

     Having read all the posts, watched the videos and with a 30 year background interest in air safety, I have a nagging feeling that the engine fuel cut off switches were pulled just after take-off. I am not saying this with the intention of idle speculation, it is just that to me nothing else seems to make sense. To anyone disagreeing with this, I really hope you are right and I am wrong.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  In addition, does it make sense to issue any Mayday call, as was reported? If both engines are not producing thrust and an impact is imminent, would any pilot not spend all conscious effort in solving the problem. Such as by going through the appropriate checklists. Every private pilot learns in flight school "aviate, navigate, communicate", in that order. Is it not mighty weird that a pilot would find it more important to communicate?

  The requirement to lift the cutoff switch out of the detent before moving it is an important point. However, those switches are close together and unless the the detent requires significant force I suggest that they could be operated together with one hand if that was an intentional action.

  Extremely difficult to accomplish with one hand, might even be impossible. There also would be no muscle memory to do both at the same time. I was as most pilots taught always shut down one engine at a time even at the gate to insure you never build that type of habit pattern.

    <b>
     On the ground
    </b>
    , if the aircraft is incorrectly in

    <b>

    , flaps might auto-retract, and various layers of system protection may be disabled.
    <br/>

  </ul>
  In the case of the ANA 787, it appears the engine shutdown occurred during the landing roll, possibly when the TCMA system activated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <b>
   2. Pilot misselection of fuel control switches to cutoff

  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is still a very real possibility. If it occurred, the pilot responsible may not have done it consciously&mdash;his mindset could have been in a different mode.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There&rsquo;s precedent: an A320 pilot once inadvertently shut down both engines over Paris. Fortunately, the crew managed to restart them. Afterward, the pilot reportedly couldn&rsquo;t explain his actions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If something similar happened here, then when the pilots realized the engines had stopped producing thrust, pushing the levers forward would have had no effect. It&rsquo;s easy to overlook that the fuel switches are in the wrong position&mdash;they're far from the normal scan pattern.

  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking personally, when I shut down engines at the end of a flight, I consciously force myself to operate each fuel switch
  <i>
   independently
  </i>
  and with full attention. I avoid building muscle memory that might lead to switching off both engines in a fast, well-practiced habit.

  On item 1, the TCMA issue should have been fixed, it does fit the sort of issue that occurred here. TDRACER can talk to that, and has done in 2019 and again in post 792. As to flap auto retraction, the B787 like all Boeings has a gated flap lever, and the flaps are only able to move independent of the lever by flap load relief. That would not have caused a loss of thrust, and in this case it is evident that the event is a thrust loss not a CL loss.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On item 2, the video shows no asymmetry at any time, so there is only a symmetric failure of the engines possible. Back on a B747 classic, you could chop all 4 engines at the same time with one hand, on a B737, also, not so much on a B777 or B787. I would doubt that anyone used two hands to cut the fuel at screen height. Note, there was a B744 that lost one engine in cruise when a clip board fell off the coaming. Didn't happen twice, and it only happened to one engine.

     Yes indeed, the moment they pulled the gear lever, as we see the gear begin the retraction process, and then suddenly stop. Almost as if they suddenly lost power.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     We can see the landing gear retraction process begin. We see the bogies tilted in the second video. We can hear the RAT. We can see the RAT. We can see the flaps extended in the video and at the crash site. There isn't actually a single piece of evidence the flaps were raised, it's just a conclusion people jumped too before evidence began to emerge.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The crazy thing is, when the report comes out and there is no mention of flaps none of the people who have been pushing the flap theory will self reflect or learn anything. They'll think those of us who didn't buy into it were just lucky, rather than it being down to use of fairly simple critical thinking.

  Neila83 is correct, the gear tilt pre retraction is rear wheels low, and at the commencement of the selection of the retraction cycle (generally),
  <strike>
   the first thing that happens is the inboard MLG doors start to open below the wheel well and then the bogie is driven to front wheels low.
  </strike>
  (There is also an option that the inboard gear doors start to open early as a result of WOW sensing to improve the SSL climb limit). [my bad, for the B788 Capt Bloggs informs us the gear door sequence is after the tilt, not before, the B789 has the before tilt, the option for the door open at rotate is separate]
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <strike>
   The inboard doors do not appear to have opened in this case, yet, the gear is forward wheels down. This appears to be out of sequence. TD may have better knowledge on the options that exist with the B788, but this is not looking good at this time.
  </strike>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There is enough in the way of anomalies here to end up with regulatory action, and airlines themselves should/will be starting to pore over their systems and decide if they are comfortable with the airworthiness of the aircraft at this moment. A latent single point of failure is not a comfortable place to be. Inhibiting TCMA might be a good interim option, that system could have been negated by having the
  <b>
   ATR ARM switches....(Both)... ARM
  </b>
  deferred to the before takeoff checks. The EAFR recovery should result in action within the next 24-48 hours. Boeing needs to be getting their tiger teams warmed up, they can ill afford to have a latent system fault discovered that is not immediately responded to, and the general corporate response of
  <i>
   "blame the pilots"
  </i>
  is not likely to win any future orders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I think we are about to have some really busy days for the OEM.

     A long while ago I posted on the Rumour thread about a ban on drinks on the flight deck sent to a BA, A350 mid Atlantic. It was prompted by 2 separate instances of uncommanded unrecoverable engine shut downs due to drink spills across the fuel cut off switches. It was widely mocked by the professional pilots on here until proven to be absolutely factually correct. If we are into speculation why not a drink left on the flight deck tips on aircraft pitch up and spills across both fuel cut-switches. Just sayin

  My next question, again I believe not discussed, is what do the 787 Fuel Cutoff switches actually do? Obviously, they cut off the fuel supplies to the engines - pretty important in engine fire and other scenarios, but goes without saying. The real question is, what do they activate (or deactivate)? I'm assuming a simple solenoid valve, which is open when powered and closed when unpowered, but of course, there will (certainly) be Electro-Mechanical or Solid-State (Electronic) relays between the switches and the (solenoid valves).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I guess the next obvious question is, is there anything else that can turn off those Fuel Cutoff Valves - a computer condition for example. I'm assuming not, but I think it needs to be considered.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Taking each switch individually, next, since this is part of an electrical circuit, and of necessity must include Electrical Relays, there is certainly at least one and in all probability two electric Power Sources involved in this circuit. One supply which passes through the switch to activate the relay, and, I'm assuming, a second, higher current and probably higher voltage supply which drives the (solenoid?) valve.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As I see it, interrupting either supply will have the same effect - if the system is wired in the Positive-Postive sense, meaning a current through the switch causes the relay to pass a current through the (solenoid). If either of these supplies is cut, the Fuel Shutoffs will shut off the fuel. So, the question is, where do these supplies come from, and under what circumstances could they be cut off?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sure, it looks to some (myself included) like a near simultaneous cutoff of both engines, but that doesn't have to have been caused by either of the pilots. I know there is huge redundancy built into the 787 Electrical Systems, but some of the evidence is suggesting that there was something not right with the plane's electrical system. I'm also fairly sure that there will be parts and places where certain faults can take the system down, despite the redundancy. I can't say where, but it's very difficult to design a perfect system, especially where there has to be transfers between multiple potential supplies and single actuators, motors or valves.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Having spent years repairing electrical and electronic systems, I know that the most difficult of all electrical faults are the intermittent ones. And I suspect that this is at the root of this crash. An intermittent or faulty AOA sensor has "caused" (provoked) multiple famous crashes... Can't find the one I'm looking for (pre-1980, I think) as the Max AOA issues dominate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I can cite a very personal example, which involved the electrical supply to my house. I had several computers running 24x365 so of course, ran them off a UPS, which turned out to be a very good thing. I started to notice that at certain times, the UPS would activate - it would cut in and take over the computer loads, its alarm would go off to indicate a power fault. But the power was still on! This carried on for weeks and I initially blamed the UPS. Then, I noticed that it only happened on very hot afternoons...  Long story short, the fault was caused by an electrical linesman, probably 30 years earlier, failing to tighten up a joint clamp on the phase wire to our house, across the street. Heating caused expansion then movement, and the power would momentarily go off then back on, and the UPS detected this. I note that this crash was on a hot day, and maybe this plane (which I believe was repositioned for the flight), had not been operating in such high temperatures recently, meaning the problem went unnoticed.

     Even though there is no point speculating about the cause of this accident, it is the nature of the beast to have questions. As pilots (most of us at least), we do have an inquiring mindset.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     My initial thoughts were an inadvertent flap retraction. But with the &lsquo;evidence&rsquo; that has been presented over the last 48 hours, I think we can safely discard that option.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     What we think we know is:
     <br/>
     - RAT was deployed (highly possible)
     <br/>
     - Gear was selected up, but did not operate (bogey tilted, doors remained closed)
     <br/>
     - APU was &lsquo;on&rsquo; (APU door open on after crash pictures)
     <br/>
     - Flight path
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Any of these observations, alone, would mean very little. However, in combination, they all point to a dual engine flameout just at/after the rotation. The aircaft has enough kinetic energy to reach roughly 150ft altitude, end then starts a shallow descent at &lsquo;alpha max&rsquo; into the buildings ahead. The RAT deployed, APU attempted auto-start, gear was unable to retract.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I only wonder why the engines spooled down. Bird strike seems to be out of the question, so that leaves us with only a very few options, which include a software bug or a suicidal pilot (not a popular option, I understand, but we have to take all options into account).
     <br/>
     <br/>
     What I don&rsquo;t believe is incorrect FCU selections, since that would not explain the high AOA on impact. It also would not explain the RAT, no gear retraction or the APU inlet flap open. Another thing that is highly unlikely is any switching done by the pilots, especially RAT etc.. These airborne time is just too little, pilots usually don&rsquo;t take any action below approximately 400ft, and these switches are so &lsquo;underused&rsquo; that a pilot would not find them instantaneously in a high stress situation.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     For me, a dual engine flameout seems the only possible explanation, now we only have to wait for its cause.

  Is it possible to operate the fuel cut-off switches accidently?

  I asked this yesterday, and was told no. You have to pull them out before you can move them up or down. So you can't operate them if, say, your hand slips violently off the throttle lever and drops down into the switches.

  A question for B787 pilots or mechanics.
  <br/>
  Is it correct to assume that the EFSOV valves are actuated by the fuel flow and controlled by an electric signal coming directly from the relevant EEC. Meaning that the simultaneous closing of the 2 valves would require an improbable simultaneous failure of the 2 EEC, or that the 2 fuel switches are flipped from "run" to "cut-off" at almost the same time, feeding the same command to the 2 EEC.
  <br/>
  And that the spar fuel valves are electrically actuated with the power coming from the hot battery bus and the signal coming from the aft electronic bay (possibly from the same control unit)?

     <br/>
     00:18 Rotation. Normal takeoff config.
     <br/>
     00:24 Gear up starts. per Raffael with FF.
     <br/>
     ......... FR24 ADSB last transmission (71ft, 172kt) just before runway threshold. Matches with video aircraft altitude at 1/2 wingspan.
     <br/>
     ......... ? Full power flameout leaves N2 ~ 60%; Airspeed &lt; 200k so N2 will decay to 15% in 8-10s?
     <br/>
     ......... ? Takeoff EGT of 900C needs 25-35s to fall below 250C ?
     <br/>
     00:27 Gear up stops. per Raffael with FF. Bogies tilted.
     <br/>
     ......... ? APU starts. 20-55s to 95%N?
     <br/>
     ......... Per 787 dual-engine fail/stall memory items, PM initiates Fuel Cutoff and Run.
     <br/>
     00:28 Visible loss of thrust. Alt ~ 200ft using aircraft wingspan as measure.
     <br/>
     ......... Matches with eyewitness "within 5-10s ... it was stuck in the air".
     <br/>
     ......... Per 787 dual-engine fail/stall memory items, PM initiates RAT Switch for 1s. Whether auto or manual, the RAT initiates.
     <br/>
     ......... RAT "bang" heard by survivor
     <br/>
     ......... RAT coming online accounts for eyewitness "lights started flickering green and white".
     <br/>
     ......... Per 787 QRH below 1000ft, PF makes no change to Main Landing Gear and flaps, aircraft pointed straight for best glide.
     <br/>
     00:31 Descending visibly, somewhere beyond the runway threshold. Alt ~ 200ft using aircraft wingspan as measure.
     <br/>
     ......... ? Because EGT &gt; 250C FADEC blocks fuel (T-HOT hot restart inhibit?) so no relight though N2 &gt; 15% ?
     <br/>
     ......... 787 glide ratio between 16:1 to 25:1 with MLG down, Flaps 5. About 15-20s and 3-5000ft of glide from 200ft?
     <br/>
     ......... Some flap accounts for the ground pictures.
     <br/>
     00:34 ? N2 has presumably decayed to 15%, FADEC flips to X-START: airspeed outside envelope? No hope of relight now.
     <br/>
     ......... PM/PF transmits Mayday?
     <br/>
     ......... Video showing RAT deployed.
     <br/>
     00:46 APU reaches some fraction of 95%N (APU sound accounting for survivor's perception of thrust?).
     <br/>
     00:48 Impact. 4200ft from descent start, 3990ft from airport boundary road. 17s from visible descent start.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     if this is a valid sequence, the only remaining question is why the dual-engine failure at ~200ft agl?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     with condolences to the families and people affected.

  There should not be a max pre-start EGT limit in-flight - that should only occur on the ground for a pilot-initiated Autostart where the starting EGT redlines are lower than for in-flight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In-flight, the Autorelight function should attempt to restart the engine as soon as a flameout is detected, and for an engine flaming out at high power it might catch it before it even goes sub-idle.  Generally, Autorelight will continue attempting until some cutoff N2 at which time it will stop attempting, or if the pilot move the fuel switch to Cutoff.  And while the EEC is still powered (via its own PMA) down to roughly 10% N2, the ignition exciters required for Autorelight do get their power from the airplane.

     During the nearly two years that elapsed between AF 447 disappearing and the recovery of the flight data recorders nobody suggested that the PF might have, unwittingly, flown the aircraft, stalled, into the ocean.
     <br>
      AI 171 may prove to also have a totally unpredicted cause.
     </br>

  This was my thinking too. Extending this thinking, the technical aspect is generally quite predictable, the human element not so.
  <br>
   <br/>
   I\x92m absolutely not speculating this is the case here, but could you not achieve the effect this flight suffered by just switching off the fuel control switches at 100ft on takeoff?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   There are now so many assumptions based on the assumed state of flap, RAT etc that it\x92s becoming pointless speculation.

  Thank you for the correction.

  Could this mean that because there doesn't seem to have been any recovery once descent started, there was no fuel flow to support autorelight? Or that there was fuel flow and autorelight may have succeeded but there wasn't enough thrust generated before impact? From the video total descent time was only 17-20s. I guess what I'm asking is what would be the total cycle time if the first autorelight succeeded: flameout -&gt; autorelight -&gt; useful thrust? And if the PM executed dual-engine fail memory item fuel cutoff to run, how would that change the sequence?

     We're all shouting each other down with two main different theories on why the aircraft lost lift so shortly after takeoff.
     <br>
      <br>
       1) Incorrect flap retraction causing the aircraft to lose lift and unable to recover the energy in time. (Not unheard of and plenty of reports where this has happened - albeit usually not to a crash).
       <br>
        <br>
         2) Loss of engine thrust backed up two potential pieces of evidence that back up the RAT was deployed (apparent RAT sound, potential RAT seen on low res video).
         <br>
          <br>
           It is impossible to know which of these is the case. Considering this summary of memory items is there the potential for a combination of both theories to have taken place?
           <br>
            <br/>
            Inadvertant flap retraction by PNF leading the PF to sense a sink and loss of lift. Pushes the thrust levers forward to the firewall and still the aircraft sinks. PF looking through the HUD and so very much 'outside focused' and doesn't realise that PNF has instead moved the flaps. PF defaults to memory items for loss of thrust on both engines before PNF can realise or communicate to PF what they've done, start switches are cut off which drops the RAT and from that point they're only heading one way. This would satisfy the strongly held belief that the RAT was extended, whilst also following the more likely initial cause of an action slip by PNF starting the sequence, rather than a dual engine failure.
           </br>
          </br>
         </br>

   </div>
  </div>
  This to me makes more sense; perhaps I`ve got it wrong but in the video the trailing edge flaps definitely look up. Maybe there`s more and they weren`t.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On a flap 5 takeoff the FMS could be programmed to select climb power at flaps 1 which would seem like an apparent loss of thrust. Same as for F15 to F5 or further.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I`m not sure if they would have cycled the FCS switches or not. But the airplane certainly would have experienced a loss of lift would the flaps been inadvertently retracted.  As well as perceived loss of thrust.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  OTOH any castastophic failure which left the gear down would have essentially left the flaps where they were. They are hydraulically activated with electrical backup but it`s wayyyyy slow.

  Another hour spent sifting through the stuff since last night (my sympathies to the mods
  <img alt="" border="0" class="inlineimg" src="https://www.pprune.org/images/smilies/worry.gif" title="Uh oh"/>
  ). A few more comments:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Real time engine monitoring" is typically not 'real time' - it's recorded and sent in periodic bursts. Very unlikely anything was sent from the event aircraft on this flight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Commanded engine cutoff - the aisle stand fuel switch sends electrical signals to the spar valve and the "High Pressure Shutoff Valve" (HPSOV) in the Fuel Metering Unit, commanding them to open/close using aircraft power. The HPSOV is solenoid controlled, and near instantaneous. The solenoid is of a 'locking' type that needs to be powered both ways (for obvious reasons, you wouldn't want a loss of electrical power to shut down the engine). The fire handle does the same thing, via different electrical paths (i.e. separate wiring).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As I've noted previously, a complete loss of aircraft electrical power would not cause the engines to flameout (or even lose meaningful thrust) during takeoff. In the takeoff altitude envelope, 'suction feed' (I think Airbus calls it 'gravity feed') is more than sufficient to supply the engine driven fuel pumps. It's only when you get up to ~20k ft. that suction feed can become an issue - and this event happened near sea level.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Not matter what's happening on the aircraft side - pushing the thrust levers to the forward stop will give you (at least) rated takeoff power since the only thing required from the aircraft is fuel and thrust lever position (and the thrust lever position resolver is powered by the FADEC).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The TCMA logic is designed and scrubbed so as to be quite robust - flight test data of the engine response to throttle slams is reviewed to insure there is adequate margin between the TCMA limits and the actual engine responses to prevent improper TCMA activation. Again, never say never, but a whole lot would have had to go wrong in the TCMA logic for it to have activated on this flight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Now, if I assume the speculation that the RAT deployed is correct, I keep coming up with two potential scenarios that could explain what's known regarding this accident:
  <br/>
  1) TCMA activation shutdown the engines
  <br/>
  or
  <br/>
  2) The fuel cutoff switches were activated.
  <br/>
  I literally can come up with no other plausible scenarios.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In all due respect to all the pilots on this forum, I really hope it wasn't TCMA. It wouldn't be the first time a mandated 'safety system' has caused an accident (it wouldn't just be Boeing and GE - TCMA was forced by the FAA and EASA to prevent a scenario that had never caused a fatal accident) - and there would be a lot embarrassing questions for all involved. But I personally know many of the people who created, validated, and certified the GEnx-1B TCMA logic - and can't imagine what they would be going through if they missed something (coincidentally, one of them was at my birthday party last weekend and inevitably we ended up talking about what we used to do at Boeing (he's also retired)). Worse, similar TCMA logic is on the GEnx-2B (747-8) - which I was personally responsible for certifying - as well as the GE90-115B and the 737 MAX Leap engine - the consequences of that logic causing this accident would be massive.
