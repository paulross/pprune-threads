     How could the CVR have been "read out" if the CVR hasn't yet been located?

  The flight recorder on the 787 is called "enhanced airborne flight recorder" (EAFR), and it's a combination unit with CVR and FDR functionality. There are two on the aircraft, the one in the front has battery backup.
  <br/>
  Since it has been reported that the "FDR" was found, they also have the "CVR".

  Absolutely. This confidence that the EAFR has already been read is misplaced. It\x92s a specialist piece of equipment and probably can\x92t even be downloaded in India. It\x92s most likely on its way to the NTSB, the BEA or the AAIB (UK) for analysis which will be done under strict conditions (for obvious reasons).

  While reading this post, I was wondering whether
  <a href="https://www.constructionworld.in/policy-updates-and-economic-news/ram-mohan-naidu-inaugurates-indias-advanced-black-box-lab-at-aaib/71791" target="_blank">
   the opening just last April
  </a>
  and with much bravado (if I might say), of the brand-new, state-of-the-art FDR-lab and CVR-lab in Delhi, would not be an important 'political' factor deciding where the EAFR(s) are going to be processed.
  <br/>
  An if they decide to do it locally, they will take their time (I hope) not to screw up their
  <i>

  It isn't. It's essentially just a CVR and FDR in the same box. The main USP is that you now have two of each, about as far apart from each other as possible on the aircraft.
  <br>
   <br>
    Each is downloaded separately in pretty much the same way as always.

     I was referring to CVR/FDRs in general being specialist equipment requiring specialist facilities to process. In any case, I would be very interested to find out where those from this accident are read. It appears from a post upthread there are new facilities in New Dehli that could be used. Having said that, for the EK 521 accident in Dubai the recorders were sent to the UK for analysis, despite a "flight data recorder centre" in Abu Dhabi being opened (again with much fanfare) by the UAE GCAA five years before the occurrence.

  The Indian AAIB successfully downloaded both FDR and CVR data from an Air India 787's EAFR relating to an incident in 2018, so your misgivings on that account are unfounded.

  I have no misgivings, I\x92m just challenging the assertion that because the recorders have been found, they have already been read. There\x92s any number of reasons why they may not have been read yet, in India or anywhere else.

     the difference may lay in the content that was recorded and not so much the 2 identical EAFR's. Only the forward EAFR is connected to a dedicated backup battery (RIPS) which also provides backup power to the Cockpit Area Microphone. So in case of a major electrical power mishap, the forward - and likely (externally?) damaged - EAFR might be crucial for recovering all available CVRecordings. Hence the somewhat understandable split-up in news-reports, between FDR data (from the rear EAFR) and complete CVR recordings (from the forward).
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Absolutely.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If the aft EAFR ceased recording at the point (just short of the runway end) where the ADS-B and likely everything else went dark, then the extra 30 seconds of CVR recording from the forward recorder could well be crucial to the investigation.

  Up above - apologies I can't find the post... - someone mentioned that the EAFRs
  <i>
   might
  </i>
  send data wirelessly..... Here's the GE "brochure" for the current EAFR (although I am not certain exactly which model would be on the subject aircraft):
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <a href="https://www.geaerospace.com/sites/default/files/enhanced-aircraft-flight-recorder-3254F.pdf" target="_blank">
   https://www.geaerospace.com/sites/de...rder-3254F.pdf
  </a>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  which is an interesting read on what EAFR can and can't (or at least, doesn't) do. It's clear - to me - from that document that wireless data transmission is
  <b>
   <i>
    not
   </i>
  </b>
  a feature of the EAFR. Basically, ethernet cable only. Some data acessible on the aircraft itself, some (CVR in particular) only available when the EAFR is in the lab.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One thing I did not know is:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <i>
   The Image Recorder growth function is used to record visual images of the flight deck instruments, flight deck, the aircraft structures, and engines as required.
  </i>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The final two words of course mean that Air India 787s might, or might not, have that feature enabled. And indeed, it being called a "growth function" probably means "not currently implemented"....

     Absolutely.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     If the aft EAFR ceased recording at the point (just short of the runway end) where the ADS-B and likely everything else went dark, then the extra 30 seconds of CVR recording from the forward recorder could well be crucial to the investigation.
    </div>

  SLF here. Please excuse some ignorant questions, and please delete if this is simply contributing to the 'noise':
  <br/>
  <br/>
  1) Why would the Aft EAFR stop recording if the main battery were available?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  2) The Aft EAFR has its own dedicated analogue connection from the CAM. Is it the case that other relevant audio streams are not generated and/or transported over the fibre-optic data network to the Aft EAFR when on (main) battery power alone?

     Not clear. Is it only the front black box which is badly damaged? The plural "Recorders" may refer to voice and data recorders in the one box.
     <br>
      And if the rear box does not ave battery back up, then even if undamaged, it may not have all the desired information.

   The forward installed EAFR along with the Cockpit Area Microphone and Preamplifier are typically connected to the Recorder Independent Power Supply (RIPS), providing a backup power source for 10 minutes in the event of power interruptions.

  The rear EAFR doesn't have power backup.  So it will only record data (both CVR and FDR) while it has normal electrical power. At what point before impact that power was lost, we do not know.

  So to be clear, this was announced of Thursday 19 June. The one EAFR was recovered on Friday 13 June I believe and one on Sunday 15 June.

  You're absolutely right, Musician! Your text in bold print is what happened! And you and I and many other pilots know what the most probale cause for that is. What evidence do we need?

  The EAFR will tell the story, but the reason for the crash will always remain a "mystery" because the B787 was not equipped with EPTPR's! (

  Do both EAFRs run on emergency power? Could it be possible that only ONE (if any) EAFR unit was recording after the supposed loss of thrust on both engines? If the other one is severely damaged we might as well end up with NO EAFR data from the critical last part of the flight. Perhaps both units are severely damaged?

  No, only the forward EAFR is connected to an independent power supply, and of course it will then only collect data from sources that themselves remain powered on.

  At the risk of stating the bleeding obvious, the EAFR is designed to withstand a crash and there being two helps, the fact that we can see a largely intact tail cone and stab is encouraging. There was some power as the radio was serviceable.

  Both EAFR run on standby power, yes. In addition, the forward EAFR has its own battery backup. However, the number of devices that still send valid data to the EAFR during a power outage is diminished, of course.
