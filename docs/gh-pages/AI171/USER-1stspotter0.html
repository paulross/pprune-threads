     As so much of the analysis hinges on whether or not the RAT was deployed, I notice that back in 2015 on another forum somone posed the question
     <br/>
     https://forum.dcs.world/topic/119812-787-deployed-ram-air-turbine/"I wonder why so many of these 787's land with their Ram Air Turbine deployed?"
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Ttere are a number of videos around showing 787s landing with RAT deployed and it appears that this happens with 787s more than other types.
     <br/>
     Can any knowledgeable Pruner answer this? Is there a problem with the 787's RAT and its deployment, or is the deployment a symptom of a problem within the 787s systems?
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Each Boeing 787 will perform at least one testflight at Boeing before delivery to the customer. This flight has the RAT deployed as a test. Most if not all videos you see were made at Boeing Everett Factory. You will see a couple of times a B787 in the Boeing livery.

     We can debate over a poor quality photo but the audio evidence presented earlier today is pretty conclusive.. The RAT was out.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Extremely likely the RAT was out:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  1. there are multiple frames of the video showing ' something' at the position where the RAT is located under the fuselage
  <br/>
  2. the sound in the video which is very similar to a deployed RAT
  <br/>
  3. the sound analysis posted here by multiple people
  <br/>
  last but not least
  <br/>
  4. the aircraft stopped transmitting ADSB data shortly after the rotating. This indicates an electrical failure. Other aircraft ADSB data was picked up by FR24 receivers indication there is a good reception of the signal in that area.

     There are more data messages than that, which FR24 shared on the day of the accident and which have been posted a few times in this thread. I'm pretty sure there's also been a comparison of this + previous flights posted in this thread that shows that while the coverage at the airport itself is spotty, it's reasonable to expect further messages to have been received before impact.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Not sure how permanent the content at this URL is, but here's a link to FR24's update which has a CSV with all frames received

  Somebody on this forum did some analysis with FR24 data of this flight and other AI171 B787 flights.
  <br/>
  See

   this article for an overview of all scenarios.

  It all looks very like to an commanded dual engine shutdown. Why nobody knows.

     The independent ADS-B Exchange receiver(s) didn't pick up the signal at all during the departure.

  I suggest to read this blog by Flightradar24. It does show the receiver(s) picked up signal after rotation of the aircraft.

     People really need to stop using FR24 data if they don't understand it.
     <br/>
     This FR24 recording of AI171
     <br/>
     <a href="https://www.flightradar24.com/data/flights/ai171#3ac3097" target="_blank">
      https://www.flightradar24.com/data/f.../ai171#3ac3097
     </a>
     <br/>
     only consists of 4 unique ADS-B data messages. The first two were on the apron/taxiway. Then one at the runway intersection. And the fourth and last one just after the aircraft became airborne. That's all.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The two last ADS-B data messages are more than 4 minutes apart. It was 8:04 UTC when they entered the runway at the intersection. The next and last data point was received at 8:08 UTC.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The map view connects these dots, so it looks like a proper track. But in reality the ADS-B receiver barely received anything. It's therefore silly to argue the aircraft stopped transmitting ADS-B data based on this poor recording. The only thing you can say with certainty is that FR24's ADS-B receiver at Ahmedabad has really, really poor coverage...
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Flightradar24 published the CSV with all received data. It had EIGHT datapoints of the aircraft after its rotation showing its altitude.

     Can we focus on theories explaining the facts? Specifically:
     <ul>
      <li>
       Aircraft used almost the whole runway (3500m)
      </li>
      <li>
       Flaps found on the ground in setting 5
      </li>
      <li>
       RAT deployed
      </li>
      <li>
       Mayday that they lost power
      </li>
     </ul>
     this rules out flap up instead of gear up , selecting wrong autopilot setting, gear up causing electrical faults (as problems started earlier - using up all runway). Something must have happened on the runway (after v1?) that led to loss of electrics (and dual engine failure, maybe later?)
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Define facts! Reported by an eyewitness, reported by Indian media? The ' mayday that they lost power.' is not a fact but invented by a journalist. The " aircraft used the whole runway" is not officially reported by the investigators but noted by an Indian newspaper. In the same article of today this newspaper wrote about the fake mayday call.
