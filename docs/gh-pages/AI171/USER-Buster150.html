  I understand that the FDR has been recovered from the crashed 787.
  <br/>
  Could anyone tell me how many engine parameters are recorded and what is the sample rate.
  <br/>
  Thank you.

     What will that give you?

  As a retired gas turbine engineer including accident investigation and safety assessments, I am interested.
  <br/>
  But of course, the investigation will focus on the engine thrust demands and resultant behaviour as a key issue.

     This is nominally off-topic, being a thank you.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I haven't been on PPRuNe for well over a decade now. I stopped looking because I had the impression then that the moderators were overwhelmed, But I came on this morning to see what was so far known about the crash, and have been pleasantly surprised to find it comparatively so readable. So thank you moderators!

     As to the perennial topic of who should be posting, which has been going on for at least a quarter century, it is not just professional pilots who know about aircraft accidents. Accident investigators do also. System engineers have important things to say. As do safety engineers - the kinds of people who perform the risk analyses of technical hazards for certification purposes. And some of us have developed accident and systems analysis techniques which have been adopted by major engineering companies. We can have useful things to say.

     Former Boeing Engineer, actually worked on this specific airplane prior to delivery. To me this all comes down to if the RAT was actually out. If not, lots of different factors people have already debated and likely some sort of pilot error that I'll let the pilots on this forum debate.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     If the RAT did come out, then we are looking at simultaneous dual engine failure basically at V2 which is so improbable (without bird strikes or purposeful actions) that it is basically impossible. This is a 330 Min ETOPS aircraft. I saw no rudder deflection or yaw indicating 1 engine failed first and then they shut down the second one on accident.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Only two realistic options for me in that case are:
     <br/>
     1. cutoff of the engines by the pilots. Either on purpose or accidental.
     <br/>
     2. maintenance actions by the Air India ground team that caused issues with the engine system or power generation system.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     2 is the only one I haven't seen mentioned here and I say this as a no longer Boeing employee. We STRUGGLED with AI during the EIS. They were notorious for just parking airplanes and then using them as spare parts and then screaming for help when they had to go back and get the planes ready to fly again.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Still think 1 is much more likely but will just throw out that 2 since there were complaints from previous flights about IFE and AC which to me speaks to issues with the power generation possibly being neglected.

  Not yet seen a response to my question about which engine parameters are recommended by the FDR and what is the sample rate.
  <br/>
  Hopefully you might be able to answer this.
  <br/>
  Many thanks.
  <br/>
  I am a retired gas turbine engineer who worked on safety systems and assessments and assisted on a number of accident investigations (military fast jets) and would be interested to know this.

     No it won't, each engine has an independent power supply dedicated to the FADEC.

     This has been answered many times.

  And that may be both AC and DC power supply.

     Does anyone here think it is getting close to the point where all technical explanations are exhausted?
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Maybe.
  <br/>
  As someone who has been involved in a number of military fast jet accident investigations, we were always told not to pre-judge or discount anything and be led by the actual evidence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And that is exactly what these investigators will be doing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  So I am perfectly happy to wait for their analysis.
  <br/>
  It may be telling that, thus far, nothing has been recommended regarding continued operations of this aircraft type.
