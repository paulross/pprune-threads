  Ok, so...
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some have said the RAT appears to have been deployed. This would suggest a hydraulic/electrical failure on the plane.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A hydraulic/electrical failure could well make it impossible to retract the gear immediately.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But, what do flaps do in the event of a major hydraulic/electrical failure? Is there a default that they revert back to? I was under the impression the RAT can't power the flaps?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  We can, I think, rule out engine failure, at least single engine failure because the rudder is still straight on in the
  <br/>
  Video. You can also hear the engines..

  Doesn't work like that, and significant logical errors have been made on that basis in the past. The chances of simultaneous
  <i>
   independent
  </i>
  engine failure might be a trillion to one, being a million million.
  <br/>
  &ZeroWidthSpace;&ZeroWidthSpace;&ZeroWidthSpace;&ZeroWidthSpace;&ZeroWidthSpace;
  <br/>
  But failure is often not independent. Hit a flock of birds with both engines, run out of good fuel, etc etc - then the probability is primarily that of the root event.
  <br/>

  Edit: I make no comment on whether they were running or not in this case, only the statistics

     What is the precise trigger for the RAT to deploy automatically on the 787? Full failure of both engines?
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  In flight, the RAT deploys automatically if any of the following occur:
  <br/>
  &bull; both engines have failed
  <br/>
  &bull; all three hydraulic system pressures are low
  <br/>
  &bull; loss of all electrical power to captain&rsquo;s and first officer&rsquo;s flight
  <br/>
  instruments
  <br/>
  &bull; loss of all four EMPs and faults in the flight control system occur on
  <br/>
  approach
  <br/>
  &bull; loss of all four EMPs and an engine fails on takeoff or landing
  <br/>
  <br/>
  (EMP = electric motor pump, hydraulic)
  <br/>
  FYI the RAT is an emergency source for electrical and/or hydraulic power.

  I think it may be a simple case of inaccurate takeoff performance data, or inadvertent retraction of flaps instead of gear (this can happen and does happen).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I'm no expert and open to discussion, but it looks to me like the slats are somewhat extended but the flaps weren't, or at least not from the angles we have seen so far. The autogap system on the B787 will automatically extend the slats if they are already in the middle position (i.e Flaps 1) with KIAS &lt;225. Perhaps, either the inaccurate input for takeoff performance produced figures that allowed a Flaps 1 departure, leading to a longer takeoff roll and then once out of ground effect, insufficient climb gradient and a pilot induced stall. Alternatively, at the point where you would likely ask for gear up, the PM has inadvertently selected Flaps 1 from Flaps 5 leading to the same effect. Pilots experienced startle and shock, declared a Mayday as they knew they were descending when they shouldn't be and didn't have time to appropriately react.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dual engine failure is obviously a possibilty however rare it might be. but it doesn't look like any catastrophic failure from the video. Clearly a sad day for all in aviation and looking forward to the official investigation and results, hopefully something we can all learn from.

     Don't know the TODA, TORA set up there but don't forget aircraft performance is to hit a 35 foot screen height and the use of reduced thrust means it will be at the very, very end of the runway - it's what's done almost every take-off of a jet to preserve engine performance
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  The screen height requirement relates to an engine failure at V1 with a continued take off. Without an engine failure, ( I.e. on the vast majority of take offs) the height at the end of TODA should be much higher, regardless of the use of reduced thrust.

     In that video there's a large puff of dust as they become airborne... from that I'd assume they were very close to the end of the runway if not slightly past it. It looks like they barely had enough speed to get airborne, and what little speed they did have didn't take them very far. The big question is why they barely climbed... performance issue, engine failure, birdstrike? No idea.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  That looks like wing tip vortices, spreading out after rotation/liftoff, picking up some dust from beside the runway well behind and below the aircraft.

     nothing was normal the plane rotated right at the end of the runway far too late and barely climbed at all for 10 seconds before falling 20 seconds and finally crashing 30 seconds after take off.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The most obvious answer is low power/flaps setting if the engines were weird they would have probably aborted take off. Bird strike/engine issue during take off roll after v1? Super unlikely but never say never
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  An aircraft using derated thrust will use most of the runway to reach V1. It's not far too late. The initial climb looks normal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If the flaps weren't set then the aircraft would have accelerated on the runway faster, not slower. But I don't think the flaps were set wrong, or retracted early. The flaps appear extended in the video and the post crash photo. Why do you think a bird strike after V1 is unlikely? If you fly into a flock of birds a double engine failure is no less likely then a single failure. My initial thought watching the first video this lunchtime was power loss in both engines, probably bird strikes. I still think that.

  Both videos evidence a normal rotation and climb followed swiftly by an abrupt cessation of the climb. No sign of yaw. But an apparent catastrophic loss of thrust. To me this points to dual engine failure. Statistically the most likely cause would be bird strike. The flap/gear configurations are probably not causative.

  The theories concerning inadvertent flap retraction are not consistent with the apparent transcript from the mayday call made or rat deployment. In the first video that circulated, the engines can\x92t really be heard (certainly not producing any significant amount of thrust). If the aircraft was climbing out misconfigured, those engines would be screaming. Instead, all you can hear is the rat.

  Similarly - a bird strike, knocking out two engines simultaneously is a noisy/messy event and I would expect to see evidence of this occurring in both videos, and in the area at the point of ingestion.

  The issue I have with the \x91mis-selected flaps up\x92 theory is that if PM had accidentally retracted flaps, I\x92d expect the PF to lower the nose, apply max thrust to try and accelerate by flying level or in a minimal descent. In this accident, the nose never seems to get lowered to decrease the AoA, in fact pitch increases just before it seems to stall. I\x92d also expect similar for an overweight takeoff, thrust or loadsheet error.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fact none of the above happened, coupled with the lack of landing gear coming up, makes me think they didn\x92t have thrust to play with.

     I hate to say it but it looks to me like a dual engine failure or both engine master switches set to off after take-off.

    Background
    <br/>
    In-service reports have been received from operators of the affected airplanes where the AFDS altitude hold ALT hold mode was erroneously engaged during takeoff. One recent event resulted in an unusually low initial rate of climb. Another recent event resulted in a slight descent after takeoff, triggering a ground proximity warning system (GPWS) &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Sink&rdquo; caution message. Once airborne, the flightcrews pushed the Take Off/Go Around (TO/GA) switch to restore proper pitch guidance. Review of flight data from the reported events showed the activation of ALT pitch mode prior to takeoff without the crew&rsquo;s recognition.
    <br/>
    --fast forward
    <br/>
    For 787s:
    <br/>
     Inadvertent selection of the Altitude Hold Switch on the MCP.
    <br/>
     Inadvertent selection of the FLCH, VS/FPA when the MCP selected altitude is within 20
    <br/>
    feet of the displayed barometric altitude.
    <br/>
     The Flight Director is ON with the Inertial Reference System (IRS) OFF (including during
    <br/>
    initiation of IRS alignment), and the MCP selected altitude is within 20 feet of the
    <br/>
    displayed barometric altitude.

  Would any of our 787 qualified pilots care to comment on this as it relates, or doesn't relate, to the aircraft's brief flight shown on the CCTV video?

     The theories concerning inadvertent flap retraction are not consistent with the apparent transcript from the mayday call made or rat deployment. In the first video that circulated, the engines can\x92t really be heard (certainly not producing any significant amount of thrust). If the aircraft was climbing out misconfigured, those engines would be screaming. Instead, all you can hear is the rat.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Similarly - a bird strike, knocking out two engines simultaneously is a noisy/messy event and I would expect to see evidence of this occurring in both videos, and in the area at the point of ingestion. The engines don\x92t just roll back with a bird strike - they surge, smoke, bang and splutter. It would be very apparent.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     At this time, I think everything is pointing towards both engines simultaneously having their fuel feeds interrupted between V1 and Vr. CVR/FDR will be interesting.

   </div>
  </div>
  I strongly agree with you. Fuel Cross feed valve is an example.

     Any chance this was fuel contamination?

  That was my first thought. You don\x92t get a double engine failure for nothing else but that and maybe birds, but birds would have caused some trailing smoke or at least some visible signs on cctv at some point throughout the ingestion period.

  OK, I promised some informed speculation when I got back, so here goes:
  <br/>
  Disclaimer: never worked the 787, so my detailed knowledge is a bit lacking.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  First off, this is perplexing - especially if the RAT was deployed. There is no 'simple' explanation that I can come up with.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  GEnx-1B engines have been exceptionally reliable, and the GE carbon composite fan blades are
  <i>
   very
  </i>
  robust and resistant to bird strike damage (about 15 years after the GE90 entry into service, I remember a GE boast that no GE90 (carbon composite) fan blades had needed to be scrapped due to damage (birdstrike, FOD, etc. - now that was roughly another 15 years ago, so is probably no longer true, but it shows just how robust the carbon composite blades are - far better than the more conventional titanium fan blades).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Not saying it wasn't somehow birdstrike related, just that is very unlikely (then again, all the other explanations I can come up with are also very unlikely
  <img alt="" border="0" class="inlineimg" src="https://www.pprune.org/images/smilies2/icon_rolleyes.gif" title="Roll Eyes (Sarcastic)"/>
  ).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Using improper temp when calculating TO performance - after some near misses, Boeing added logic that cross-compares multiple total temp probes - aircraft TAT (I think the 787 uses a single, dual element probe for aircraft TAT, but stand to be corrected) and the temp measured by the engine inlet probes - and puts up a message if they disagree by more than a few degree tolerance - so very, very unlikely.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  N1 power setting is somewhat less prone to measurement and power setting errors than EPR (N1 is a much simpler measurement than Rolls EPR) - although even with EPR, problems on both engines at the same time is almost unheard of.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Auto Thrust (autothrottle) function 'falls asleep' at 60 knots - and doesn't unlock until one of several things happens - 250 knots, a set altitude AGL is exceeded (I'm thinking 3,000 ft. but the memory is fuzzy), thrust levers are moved more than a couple of degrees, or the mode select is changed (memory says that last one is inhibited below 400 ft. AGL). So an Auto Thrust malfunction is also extremely unlikely. Further, a premature thrust lever retard would not explain a RAT deployment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  TO does seem to be very late in the takeoff role - even with a big derate, you still must accelerate fast enough to reach V1 with enough runway to stop - so there is still considerable margin if both engines are operating normally. That makes me wonder if they had the correct TO power setting - but I'm at a loss to explain how they could have fouled that up with all the protections that the 787 puts on that.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If one engine did fail after V1, it's conceivable that they shut down the wrong engine - but since this happened literally seconds after takeoff, it begs the question why they would be in a big hurry to shut down the engine. Short of an engine fire, there is nothing about an engine failure that requires quick action to shut it down - no evidence of an engine fire, and even with an engine fire, you normally have minutes to take action - not seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The one thing I keep thinking about is someone placing both fuel switches to cutoff immediately after TO. Yes, it's happened before (twice - 767s in the early 1980s), but the root causes of that mistake are understood and have been corrected. Hard to explain how it could happen (unless, God forbid, it was intentional).

  Intriguing: agree it doesn't look like an inadvertent flap-less take-off, but having watched the video several times, I can&rsquo;t see any sign of a pitch-down input (ie, less pitch up) that would surely be evident following a dual engine failure. Even if the loss of almost full power from underslung engines didn't naturally cause a change of pitch (FBW), surely the first instinctive control input following such a large loss of thrust would be to lower the nose a little.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Conversely, the rapid sinking feeling induced by the inadvertent Flap retraction at the Gear-up point could confuse the senses and be interpreted as a loss of thrust?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tragic whatever the cause; I&rsquo;m sure we'll have the answer fairly soon.
