  Water ingress into the E/E bay is a serious issue. The B744 had this issue in the past causing serious problems, one of which was fortunate to not lead to a loss of the aircraft, on a B744F. The B744 pax aircraft had a number of water problems related to the toilets and the galley. The forward galley on the B742/3s had many issues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Any large aircraft going through maintenance is interesting to observe the extent of corrosion that occurs near toilets and galleys, and from water lines.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The B777 was not immune to this either. The potable water tank failing caused one of our aircraft to have 6.5 tons of ice accumulating in the underfloor area of the aft cargo hold, which we detected on a preflight walk around as a series of water streams from the drain holes in one area of the aircraft. This was an interesting item for CG, a note on weight, but only affected the electrical services related to the aft cargo systems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Water accumulations on the B744 came to light at rotate, and took out a lot of electrical services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  My suspicion is some cause such as this will come to light shortly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The water leak issues with the B787 go back to in service reports in 2014 and before, considered an unsafe condition in 2016, and were covered by AD 2016-14-04. This latest AD is curious as it stems from an administrative oversight in the drawings of the aircraft, that arose on aircraft manufactured from 2018 onwards. 2025-09-12 stands alone related to missing sealant, following the drawing oversight in production. It did not affect all aircraft. The earlier AD, 2016-14-04 was related to water line coupling issues, and is in Service Bulletin B787-81205-SB380009-00 WATER/WASTE - Water System- Potable Water System - Couplings Replacement. It notes on page 21 of 229 the reason for the work

     This service bulletin gives instructions to replace the existing potable water line couplings below the pas- senger compartment floor above the FORWARD (FWD) Electrical Electronic (EE) bay in Section 41 and above the AFT EE bay in Section 46. The new coupling has a strap that will ensure its latches are secure, facilitate a more rapid visual inspection of the strap engaged over the pawl and reduce the potential to in- advertently unlatch the coupling after the installation of shrouds over the tubes. If this service bulletin is not incorporated, water leaking onto equipment in the EE bays could result in an electrical short and potential loss of system functions.
     <br/>
     There have been in-service reports of water leakage in the potable water system due to potable water line couplings not being installed properly, resulting in delays and replacement of equipment in the EE bays. In six cases, the cause of the water leakage was due to improper installation of the potable waterline cou- plings.
     <br/>
     Incorporation of this service bulletin will ensure the coupling latches are secure and that after inspection, reinstallation of the shroud does not accidentally loosen the coupling.
     <br/>
     NOTE:   Due to common access requirements, operators should consider incorporation of B787-81205- SB530029 and B787-81205-SB530031 at the same time as this service bulletin is incorporated.

  The latest AD and the earlier AD highlight that problems can occur, and have done so in the past. Both of the E/E bays contain stuff that is nice to keep dry and operating, and prior events have shown that multiple system failures can and have occurred when a flood is added to all the black boxes sitting innocently on their racks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ADs are not necessarily directly related to the specific cause, they highlight the potential for water damage and that bad stuff happens. In two cases I investigated, the event occurred at rotate. Both were B744's one pax, one F.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Compound, unrelated system failures at rotate? Single cause? Water in the E/E bay.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The amount of flooding that occurs in the toilet cubicles is unfortunate, apparently towels still fit well into toilet bowls, signs are disregarded etc. Coffee grounds block galley drains with monotonous regularity, the planes are only as good as we care for them, and passengers seem to have odd ways of treating the conveniences.

  Potable/waste water leakage into the forward EE Bay is a potentially fascinating fit. Rotation sloshes water onto a critical wiring junction resulting in dual simultaneous engine shut down as well as cascading electrical failure throughout the aircraft. The hard part is thinking that Boeing's engineers would permit such a failure mode in their design. It would seem to require a substantial volume of liquid.

  The TCMA system should be inhibited when Air / Ground logic is in Air mode.
  <br/>
  I understand that it has Inputs from RadAlt, Weight on Wheels, etc.
  <br/>
  This airframe was reported to have had a history of significant electrical / electronic problems, including on the prior inbound flight.
  <br/>
  There may have been water ingress in the E&amp;E bay, likely causing corrosion or other damage.
  <br/>
  Chafed or damaged wiring / cable insulation within looms is possible. Including the landing gear microswitches.
  <br/>
  The landing gear may have been interrupted in the cycle.
  <br/>
  BOTH engines are reported to have shut down, so whatever happened is a system common to both engines.
  <br/>
  TCMA failing at the moment of gear retraction appears to fit with the available evidence.

  A Qantas 747-438 suffered an 'Electrical System Event' when on approach to Bangkok airport on 7 January 2008. The following extracts are taken from the report:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "System malfunctions
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Between 0846 and 0852, 4 after passing FL 100 and when the aircraft was turning
  <br/>
  onto an extended left downwind leg for runway 01 Right (01R), the EICAS, flight
  <br/>
  displays and automated systems showed faults of numerous electrical and other
  <br/>
  aircraft systems, including:
  <br/>
  \x95 AC buses 1, 2 and 3 not powered
  <br/>
  \x95 autothrottle disconnected
  <br/>
  \x95 autopilot disengaged
  <br/>
  \x95 some fuel pumps not operating
  <br/>
  \x95 weather radar not operating
  <br/>
  \x95 automatic cabin air conditioning and pressurisation system not operating
  <br/>
  \x95 right (FO\x92s) displays blanked
  <br/>
  \x95 between three and five pages of messages on the EICAS display
  <br/>
  \x95 lower EICAS display blanked.
  <br/>
  The CSM contacted the flight crew and advised that the cabin lighting had failed."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Origin of Generator Control Unit (GCU) faults
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Post-incident examination of the GCUs revealed corrosion of the internal circuit
  <br/>
  boards in all three of the GCUs that shut down. Analysis of the corrosion materials
  <br/>
  observed in GCU 3 showed evidence of long-term exposure to water, including
  <br/>
  evidence of acids and carbohydrates that are present in beverages such as coffee,
  <br/>
  fruit juice and soft drinks. Those findings indicated a fluid source originating from
  <br/>
  the aircraft\x92s galley drains or from spilt liquids in the cabin, and also suggested that
  <br/>
  liquid ingress had been occurring over an unknown, but extended period of time."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <a href="https://www.atsb.gov.au/sites/default/files/media/3440510/ao2008003.pdf" target="_blank">
   https://www.atsb.gov.au/sites/defaul.../ao2008003.pdf
  </a>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This link to the report includes diagrams of where the 747 forward galley was located, directly above the Main Equipment Centre and the E1/E2 racks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The phtographs show how ineffective the dripshield was in protecting the electrical equipment and the extent of corrosion and damage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The aircraft was 17 years old at the time of the incident and had completed a C-check approximately three months before the incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As FDR notes, this issue seems to have carried over to the 787-8 with Airworthiness Directive AD 2016-14-04 (
  <a href="https://drs.faa.gov/browse/excelExternalWindow/A5DEFBD6365368B486257FEA0058AF6B.0001" target="_blank">
   https://drs.faa.gov/browse/excelExte...A0058AF6B.0001
  </a>
  )
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are issuing this AD 2016-14-04 to prevent a water leak
  <br/>
  from an improperly installed potable water system coupling, or main cabin water source, which could
  <br/>
  cause the equipment in the EE bays to become wet, resulting in an electrical short and potential loss
  <br/>
  of system functions essential for safe flight"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  AD 2016-14-04 mirrors precisely what occurred to the Qantas 747 on 7 January 2008. It is possible something similar may have occurred on take-off of AI171, with water causing the equipment in the EE bays to become wet resulting in electrical short and potential loss of system functions

     Inlet compliance is tested at max takeoff power settings, at AOA up to stall. This is done by performing something called a 'wind-up turn' - with the engine at max TO power and constant altitude, they keep pulling the turn tighter until the wing stalls and the aircraft falls out of the turn.
     <br/>
     If the engine doesn't continue normal operation, that's considered a 'fail'. Plus, the engine reaction of an over-rotated inlet (inlet separation) is a surge - accompanied by big bang and a ball of flame out the back.
     <br/>
     Nothing we know about this accident supports an over-rotation and related engine stall/surge.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Adding to your response TD, there is no time in this event where a high AOA arose prior to the final moments, around 13 seconds after the problem has occurred. AOA, intake separation is not a factor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Going back to your prior comments on FADEC and TCMA; these are independent systems to each engine, however the event indicates a symmetric loss, and the potential of water ingress from a failed E/E sealing from the main cabin services remains a single causation that could result in multiple failures at the same moment. The last time I assessed issues in the E/E bay related to unauthorised inflight access to the fwd E/E of a B777 it was sobering how many irreversible conditions could arise. The B744 water inundation cases I was involved in were both on TO, the QF event was during deceleration. We are looking at vectors that come from outside of the normal assumptions in the SSA's, water fits that bill.

  One related question: since it was reported that the packs were not functional on the previous flight and were (presumably?) fixed before the accident flight, could condensation of excess humidity in the E/E bay be a relevant mechanism?

     Inlet compliance is tested at max takeoff power settings, at AOA up to stall. This is done by performing something called a 'wind-up turn' - with the engine at max TO power and constant altitude, they keep pulling the turn tighter until the wing stalls and the aircraft falls out of the turn.
     <br/>
     If the engine doesn't continue normal operation, that's considered a 'fail'. Plus, the engine reaction of an over-rotated inlet (inlet separation) is a surge - accompanied by big bang and a ball of flame out the back.
     <br/>
     Nothing we know about this accident supports an over-rotation and related engine stall/surge.

     Something that occurred to me after I went to bed last night: My assumption that the FDR readouts would rapidly reveal the cause may be flawed.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Let me explain.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The consensus is that both engines quit shortly after liftoff (that assumes that the RAT did in fact deploy). At least one of the data recorders has battery backup, so it should have kept functioning when all aircraft power was lost.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     However...
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Over the years, I've looked at lots and lots of digital flight data recorder outputs when investigating some sort of incident or other engine anomaly, So I have become rather familiar with some of the interesting characteristics of DFDR data.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     On the 767 and 747-400, when you shutdown an engine and the IDG goes offline, there is a momentary 'glitch' in the electrical power system as it reconfigures for the available power source - this is why you see the flight deck displays flicker and return, and the cabin lights momentarily flicker. As a result, most of the avionics boxes 'reset' - this is quick, but it's not instantaneous. This shows up in the FDR data - sometimes as 'no valid data' for a few seconds, or as garbage readings of zero or 'full scale'. Now, looking at the FDR data, it's easy to simply disregard the data, so normally no big deal.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Starting with the 777 (and on the 787 and 747-8), this electrical power glitch was 'fixed' - there is slight delay (~quarter of a second IIRC) before the fuel cutoff signal is sent to the engine - during which the electrical system reconfiguration takes place so no more 'glitch' during a normal engine shutdown...Except whatever happened to these engines wasn't 'normal'.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     If there is a fuel cut at high power, the engine spools down incredibly rapidly - a second or two from max power to sub-idle. Assuming the fuel cut wasn't commanded by the flight deck fuel switches, the electrical system won't know it's coming, so it can't reconfigure until after the engine generators drop offline - and you're going to get that power glitch. Nearly every avionics box on the aircraft will reset due to this electrical glitch, and the FDR isn't going to get useful data for a few seconds (and then, only from the stuff that's on the battery bus).
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Whatever happened, happened quickly - it's quite possible that whatever initiated the high-power fuel cut didn't get recorded.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  True, I would bet that the voltage regulating architecture of the voice recorder at least will give useful information for a short time around the loss of power, as it did for the Lockerbie CVR using far less sophisticated recorder systems. That was sufficient to show the pressure pulse in the fuselage and to give a fairly good idea of where the explosion had emanated from. TWA was similar, a bigger bang though. Would be listening for any mechanical noises related to the fuel switches, and frankly I doubt that they existed, but they would be recorded.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If the cause is what I have suggested it will dificult to get direct evidence of that case, as it was for the QFA072 event as well. Like icing cases, a water ingress into the avionics is going to be a tough investigation, water would have been sprayed all over the wreckage in the aftermath. Dousing the E/E bay with 20 or 30 gallons of water will be an expensive investigative exercise to do in a real plane, with engines running. Would not want to be observing up close.

     (1) Based on a passenger's comments on line, a variety of things - passenger side - weren't working as expected. How many other things that "needed attention" could be worked on in the interval between arrival from the previous flight and the takeoff that ended up in the tragic crash?
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Can we please have a productive discussion on maintenance, to examine a new area and avoid the hamster wheel?  Can someone from turnaround crew working on 787's generally (or ex A-I staff) comment on what standard checks are performed in the allocated time?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  PAX have reported cabin issues on the inbound flight, (and other A-I flights), from no aircon for the whole flight to unresponsive screens etc.  TDRacer has explained that the FADEC is shielded from other electrical systems. However, is there ANY correlation with these cabin malfunctions and the crash other than 'poor maintenance' we can find here?  E.g.
  <i>
   what if one of Air Canada's 787's entered YYZ with the packs malfunctioning - what inspection and maintenance would be performed? C
  </i>
  ould a maintenance engineer working on fixing the packs do something to trigger a later plane-wide power loss?  Or could non-functioning cabin electrics give us a clue as to other more fatal issues present? Could the system isolation protections have failed somehow?  E.g. water ingress?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  *Each time I post this, it gets ignored, but it's an unexplored area and my view is maintenance may have played a large part in this crash, - please help to narrow it down. Thanks.

  Water was mentioned earlier in the previous iteration of this thread, as I recall  by one of the most well respected contributors on the forum and an expert in flight testing and certification issues. There have been a couple of well known incidents of flight deck screens going blank due to all sorts of electrical problems caused by water ingress into the E&amp;E bay, fortunately in daytime vmc and not on particularly electric jets, and both I believe at rotation.

Another very remote probability but many accidents and incidents are. I don&rsquo;t even know if there was any inclement weather before this flight, maybe someone could confirm?

  The TCMA runs on the FADECs (Full Authority Digital Engine Control). There is one per engine, located inside the nacelle. Each one has a dual channel design inside, to compare computations, inputs etc. and generally provide redundancy (but I don\x92t know further details on the design/logic).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The sensors and actuators related to that engine (pressure, temperature sensors, various valves etc.) are most likely directly connected to it. The two throttle position sensors per engine are also directly cabled to it according to tdracer. No idea how other inputs like WoW and RADALT are connected. The FADECs don\x92t necessarily need much else, as apparently Autopilot etc. always move the actual thrust lever.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There must also be a communication channel back to the flight recorders. No idea if it gets thrown into a comms bus or there is direct wiring.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In terms of power, each FADEC has its own alternator driven by the engine. But there\x92s a failover connection to the AC bus of the plane. Not sure if there\x92s a physical relay keeping it disconnected in normal operations.

  <br/>
  <br/>
  Perceived wisdom may be applicable in normal circumstances but not when all the holes line up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For example I've seen it quoted many times that the engine FADECs are self powered
  <br/>
  by the engines, the TCMAs-whether part of the FADEC or a separate unit, similarly self contained
  <br/>
  within the engine. The perceived wisdom seems to be that there is no common single fault
  <br/>
  which can take out both engines.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And yet we're also told that the TCMA function can only function in ground mode and receives ground-air
  <br/>
  signals from a combination of inputs from Rad Alts and WOW sensors.
  <br/>
  There is therefore a connection from the central EE bay to the engine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yes I'm sure the Rad/Alt and WOW sensor processing will use different sensors for each side and powered from different
  <br/>
  low voltage buses.
  <br/>
  However as an analogy, in your house your toaster in the kitchen may be on a separate circuit from the water heater in
  <br/>
  the bathroom, each protected by a fuse at the main switchboard. In normal operation a fault in one cannot affect the other.
  <br/>
  However a lightning strike outside the house can send much higher voltages than normal operation throughout the entire
  <br/>
  system and trash every electrical appliance not physically disconnected at the time.

  Now I'm not suggesting the aircraft was hit by lightning but FDR has proposed a single event, buildup from a water leak entering
  <br/>
  one of the EE bays at rotate. It would be possible for one or more of the HV electrical buses to short so that all the low voltage
  <br/>
  buses go high voltage. I have no knowledge of how the FADEC / TCMA systems connect to or process the Ground-Air signals but
  <br/>
  there is a single fault mechanism whereby high voltage could be simultaneously and inappropriately applied to both engine control systems.
  <br/>
  It would be unfortunate if this failure mechanism did cause power to be applied to drive the fuel shut off valve closed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since the likelihood is that we're looking at a low probability event then perceived wisdom about normal operations and fault modes
  <br/>
  might not be applicable.

     Always possible, however since a pilot made a radio call there was some

     The Jeju recorders were okay if I recall correctly, they just had no input, was that the case?

     Somoeone made a good point above about the German Wings FDR/CVR being available the next day after the aircraft was aimed at the ground like a missile. These things are built tough, as you know, this may be type specific but&hellip;.

  The equipment on RAT/battery is limited:

  )
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 787 battery fire report says the two recorders are on the left and right 28VDC buses. I don't think those get powered on RAT by the looks of it. I would wager you get whatever is on the 235VAC 'backup bus', plus the captain's and F/O's instrument buses via C1/C2 TRUs. You won't get all of that (like the F/O's screens) because the 787 energises/de-energises specific bits of equipment, not just whole buses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Losing recorder power looks entirely expected.

     SLF Engineer (electrical - not aerospace) so no special knowledge

     Perceived wisdom may be applicable in normal circumstances but not when all the holes line up.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     For example I've seen it quoted many times that the engine FADECs are self powered
     <br/>
     by the engines, the TCMAs-whether part of the FADEC or a separate unit, similarly self contained
     <br/>
     within the engine. The perceived wisdom seems to be that there is no common single fault
     <br/>
     which can take out both engines.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     And yet we're also told that the TCMA function can only function in ground mode and receives ground-air
     <br/>
     signals from a combination of inputs from Rad Alts and WOW sensors.
     <br/>
     There is therefore a connection from the central EE bay to the engine.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Yes I'm sure the Rad/Alt and WOW sensor processing will use different sensors for each side and powered from different
     <br/>
     low voltage buses.
     <br/>
     However as an analogy, in your house your toaster in the kitchen may be on a separate circuit from the water heater in
     <br/>
     the bathroom, each protected by a fuse at the main switchboard. In normal operation a fault in one cannot affect the other.
     <br/>
     However a lightning strike outside the house can send much higher voltages than normal operation throughout the entire
     <br/>
     system and trash every electrical appliance not physically disconnected at the time.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Now I'm not suggesting the aircraft was hit by lightning but FDR has proposed a single event, buildup from a water leak entering
     <br/>
     one of the EE bays at rotate. It would be possible for one or more of the HV electrical buses to short so that all the low voltage
     <br/>
     buses go high voltage. I have no knowledge of how the FADEC / TCMA systems connect to or process the Ground-Air signals but
     <br/>
     there is a single fault mechanism whereby high voltage could be simultaneously and inappropriately applied to both engine control systems.
     <br/>
     It would be unfortunate if this failure mechanism did cause power to be applied to drive the fuel shut off valve closed.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Since the likelihood is that we're looking at a low probability event then perceived wisdom about normal operations and fault modes
     <br/>
     might not be applicable.

  400VAC/540VDC (+-270V) is not really known for blowing past input protection in the same way as actual HV or lightning. I would expect some optocouplers and/or transformers to be both present and adequate. There's definitely some big MOVs scattered around the main 235VAC buses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Weight on wheels appears to go into data concentrators that go into the common core system (i.e. data network).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Presumably there is a set of comms buses between the FADECs and the CCS to allow all the pretty indicators and EICAS alerts in the cockpit to work. The WoW sensors might flow back via that, or via dedicated digital inputs from whatever the reverse of a data concentrator is called (surely they have need for field actuators other than big motors?). Either way, left and right engine data should come from completely different computers, that are in the fwd e/e bay (or concentrators/repeaters in the wings, maybe) rather than in with the big power stuff in the aft e/e bay.
