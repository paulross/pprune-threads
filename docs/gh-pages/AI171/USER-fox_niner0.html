  With a block fuel of around 50 tons the engines will receive fuel from the center tank. Also during take off. Wing capacity is 16,5 tons per wing, thus 33 tons or more as block fuel requires center tank to be used.

  Mate of mine ran the scenario in the 787-simulator:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Take-off with flaps 20, quite some weight added.
  <br/>
  at the call positive rate-gear up: they left the gear DOWN and cycled the flaps from 20 to 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  it was FLYABLE, RECOVERABLE.

  Reading a few posts about an APU-to-pack takeoff, or a packs off takeoff on a 787, because of the hot weather, makes me shake my head.
  <br/>
  There is no bleed air on the 787. A packs off takeoff, or an apu to pack takeoff, is never done. There isn&rsquo;t a procedure in the fcom to describe it. It is also pointless. The packs are electrical.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Then the gear.
  <br/>
  When you lift off the runway, the gear doors open REGARDLESS of gear lever position. If you do not raise the gear within 30 seconds, the gear doors close again and you keep the gear down as you apparently desire. In the video, the gear doors are closed again as the airplane flies into the suburb. This requires normal hydraulics in system C, which was apprently available as the doors are closed again.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  takeoff performance:
  <br/>
  I entered all relevant weather parameters into my performance tool for Ahmedabad VAAH, rwy 23, 42 degrees C and no wind, qnh 1005.
  <br/>
  It comes up with flaps 10 as optimum, albeit for a 787-9 (don&rsquo;t have the possibility to calculate for the 787-8) But even the 787-9 is able to depart with flaps 5 in those conditions. Max tow around 230tons.
