  - fuel cut offs were found in the RUN position
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - on take off roll both engines lost power as the fuel cut offs went from RUN to cutoff
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - CVR recorded one pilot asking why they had gone to CUTOFF
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - within 10 seconds the fuel cutoff was moved back to RUN
  <br/>
  <br/>
  -RAT was deployed, APU had begun auto start
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - 32 seconds after Vr the MAYDAY was called
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This should also dispel a lot of the comments about AAIB-India, Indian culture in general and general competence. For a preliminary report this is far more thorough and extensive than what would normally be expected and they\x92ve kept Boeing, GE, FAA and investigators from US, UK, Canada and Portugal in the loop from the start
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They have also clarified why it took so long to do the EAFR download- because of the extensive damage they had to source specialist equipment from the NTSB that only arrived on the 23rd of June (they downloaded on the 24th) so all that talk of a \x91coverup\x92 is pretty embarrassing now
  <br/>
  <br/>
  of course the big question is why/how those switches were commanded into cutoff in the first place  the exact sequence at Vr is the most critical, there hasn\x92t been much scrutiny at all that I can see in the Indian/international media of the personal
  <br/>
  background of the flight deck crew which has happened in other suspected pilot initiated disasters in the past, I guess this is an avenue investigators will have been doing themselves

    The aircraft achieved the maximum recorded airspeed of 180 Knots IAS at about 08:08:42
    <br/>
    UTC and immediately thereafter, the Engine 1 and Engine 2 fuel cutoff switches transitioned
    <br/>
    from RUN to CUTOFF position one after another with a time gap of 01 sec. The Engine N1
    <br/>

    <br/>
    off.
    <br/>
    In the cockpit voice recording, one of the pilots is heard asking the other why did he cutoff.
    <br/>
    The other pilot responded that he did not do so.
    <br/>
    The CCTV footage obtained from the airport showed Ram Air Turbine (RAT) getting deployed
    <br/>
    during the initial climb immediately after lift-off (fig. 15). No significant bird activity is observed
    <br/>
    in the vicinity of the flight path. The aircraft started to lose altitude before crossing the airport
    <br/>
    perimeter wall.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As per the EAFR, the Engine 1 fuel cutoff switch transitioned from CUTOFF to RUN at about
    <br/>
    08:08:52 UTC. The APU Inlet Door began opening at about 08:08:54 UTC, consistent with
    <br/>
    the APU Auto Start logic. Thereafter at 08:08:56 UTC the Engine 2 fuel cutoff switch also
    <br/>
    transitions from CUTOFF to RUN. When fuel control switches are moved from CUTOFF to
    <br/>
    RUN while the aircraft is inflight, each engines full authority dual engine control (FADEC)
    <br/>
    automatically manages a relight and thrust recovery sequence of ignition and fuel introduction.
    <br/>
    The EGT was observed to be rising for both engines indicating relight. Engine 1&rsquo;s core
    <br/>
    deceleration stopped, reversed and started to progress to recovery. Engine 2 was able to
    <br/>
    relight but could not arrest core speed deceleration and re-introduced fuel repeatedly to
    <br/>
    increase core speed acceleration and recovery. The EAFR recording stopped at 08:09:11
    <br/>
    UTC
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As per the EAFR data both engines N2 values passed below minimum idle speed, and the
    <br/>
    RAT hydraulic pump began supplying hydraulic power at about 08:08:47 UTC.

  What the hell happened in the cockpit?

  <br/>
  08:08:42  Engine 1 and Engine 2 fuel cutoff switches transitioned from RUN to CUTOFF position.

  One of the pilots asks the other why did he cutoff.

  Who (or what?) operated the cutoff switches?

  Ready to talk about the current Embraer method of respective throttle must be at idle to allow the fuel cutoff switch to send a cutoff signal?

  That's where I was going in the last page of the last, closed thread.

  Wear and tear, off by mistake, off by ill-will, off by cockpit FOD flying about at rotation, no effect with throttle forward.

  Is option 2 possible? It was my idea too but does the switch "connect" when it is not properly in its guarded possition?

  We are talking about the Engine 3 position stop/run/start switches here? SB stopping engine shut down if thrust lever are beyond flight idle? Blimey, seen a photo of the switches in question. Assume they are detented? Actually why are they not guarded?

  Not really. It might also indicate that he saw them move, knew his hands were somewhere else, or a plethora of other reasons. Even if one accidentally moves a lever or pushes the wrong button, the first response would likely be denial as well, then followed by an 'oh oops, turns out I did'.

  I assure you, if both donkeys start rolling back and the other guy asks why I closed the masters when I hadn't, that fact is extremely likely to verbalised.
  <br>
   <br>
    I would look at this from the other way and suggest it doesn't sit right as if someone had just done it deliberately, seconds after rotation, why would they bother denying it, if you see what I mean?

     The switch state could be either on or off in that position. However, the CVR makes it pretty clear that the switches were moved deliberately to off. Just not why. Also, remember the report says one switch was moved then the other. Not together.
    </div>
   </div>

  The exact quote was
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The aircraft achieved the maximum recorded airspeed of 180 Knots IAS at about 08:08:42 UTC and immediately thereafter, the Engine 1 and Engine 2 fuel cutoff switches transitioned from RUN to CUTOFF position one after another with a time gap of 01 sec."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Does anyone know what the sampling frequency of the data is? If we get one readout per second, then it's possible that a one second difference could only be a millisecond difference in real life, which doesn't necessarily rule out an accidental bump.
  <br/>
  If there truly was a second of difference, there aren't many other options than an intentional act. Not necessarily with the purpose of crashing the plane though (confusion, hallucination, distraction, ..)

  I remember the SAIB. I assessed it as &ldquo;recommended&rdquo; to all our customers and all agreed. I then raised work orders to check all fuel cut-off switches for the missing locking bar conditions. None were found defective. The preliminary report says the switches were found in the Run position. There is no mention of whether the locking mechanism is correctly in place. We need to wait for the full report for that, as this matter is still under investigation.

     Who (or what?) operated the cutoff switches?

   </div>
  </div>
  The phrase in the report is "switches transitioned from RUN to CUTOFF position".
  <br/>
  Does the FDR actually have some input of the physical position of the switches or is it just measuring the output signal voltage
  <br/>
  which might be changed by a momentary short from liquid or swarf.
  <br/>
  Both signals go to cutoff within 1 second but then one recovers four seconds after the other.
  <br/>
  Surely a pilot discovering a turned off switch would have both back on in less than four seconds.

  Are there any switches that would normally be selected/ moved immediately after take off? The suggestion being that if they were moved due to a conscious act, the  wrong switches were selected inadvertently. I am not suggesting that the switches might not still have moved for other reasons eg wear, not properly gated? But for both switches to move from Run to Cut Off within a few seconds of each other suggests a deliberate, if accidental, selection? God forbid if it was a deliberate, intentional action😞 For a member of the crew to identify,  so quickly,  that the two switches had been moved and then reinstated them was, I would suggest, miraculous\x85..unless the incorrect switch selections had been observed\x85\x85\x85

     So, if the switches haven't been fully lifted over the guard but are just sitting on the top could the acceleration/ rotation cause them to snap back to the off position. Have seen this effect on toggle switches before but not on an aircraft system.

  With a one second gap between them? Just happening to be about the same amount of time it takes to switch one then the other by hand? - No. Has anyone ever been aware of a single cutoff switch 'spontaneously' moving?

  Again, you can not conclude that from the report.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Different inputs are sampled at different rates. Some very basic info here:
  <a href="https://scaledanalytics.com/2023/04/25/arinc-767-or-what-do-you-mean-my-b787-uses-767-data/" target="_blank">
   https://scaledanalytics.com/2023/04/...uses-767-data/
  </a>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's highly likely switch positions are only sampled at 1Hz, and not at 100 Hz. For engine parameters you'll likely want a higher sample rate, as the whole engine could go from perfectly fine to exploded in less than a second.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If you had something like:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  08:08:42.96 UTC: cut off switch 1
  <br/>
  08:08:43.01 UTC: cut off switch 2
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It would likely be recorded as:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  08:08:42 UTC: cut off switch 1
  <br/>
  08:08:43 UTC: cut off switch 2
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leading you to believe there was one second between these 2 actions, whereas it was actually only 50ms.
