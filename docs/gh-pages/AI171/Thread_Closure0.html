  It is obvious to the Mod Team that there is an overwhelming amount of posts from PPRuNers new and old who have not read the thread nor used the Search function before bursting into print.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the sake of our sanity and personal time this thread is closed for a couple of hours to give you all time to actually read it before launching into your version of events.

  Firstly it will be clear that we posted our respective audio analyses about the same time. There was no collaboration I assure you, and in fact I'd been waiting all day to see if someone else with more recent or pertinent experience than me would do something. When I hadn't seen anything I spent a little time and came up with what I did, however I think Kraftstoffvondesibel's work is probably more useful than mine given their specific plot methodology and that they included a non-RAT 'control' pass. I was in the process of acknowledging this when the thread was closed; late at night for me which is why this post is now some hours on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the time I posted I was fairly circumspect for the reasons given but, with the similarities between our results and along with some other detail that's come to light in PM, I am now more persuaded that the acoustic print we both observed is most likely to be from a RAT (although until this is confirmed a question must necessarily remain).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  FWIW, and in part answer to a later post enquiring about the noise of a RAT dropping into position, this also aligns somewhat with the survivor's apparent observation of a noise ('bang'?) prior to impact, and an

  This is a new thread with a small selection of the contributions from the original Air India crash thread which is now closed. By no means comprehensive they give a grounding for further discussion here on PPRuNe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Please remember this is a Professional Pilots forum, and speculation by new signups, SLF and others will only be accepted if proven relevant and accurate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On a lighter note we achieved our highest number of viewers ever a couple of days ago, highlighting the interest that PPRuNe has as a source of factual information across the Forums. My sincere thanks to our regular members and to the Mod Team for their continued hard work behind the scenes üëç

  Having given this thread plenty of time to settle, plus plenty of notice from various Mods, it has become a Hamsterwheel with no beneficial posts contributing to the thread for some time. That is including the dozens of Moderated posts you don't get to see, just in the past 24 hours!

  <br/>
  Thread closed until the next
  <b>
   official
  </b>
  announcement.

  Meanwhile, those of you now with time on their hands, please consider updating your Personal Profile to

     Gets tiring correcting glaring errors such as the recent one wrongly asserting separate tanks for each engine is mandatory on TO or that it is routine to turn centre pumps on at 10,000'. Many of us just read it and say "that is clearly BS", "The person has not read the thread", then move on looking for some actual updated information, or news, while not speculating at all.

  This is a valid complaint.
  <br/>
  We'll take a brief pause in hopes of some fresh info from the investigating authority.

  Come back tomorrow, this has turned back into a Hamsterwheel.

    Pretty easy to post &amp; discuss unsubstantiated rumours in the absence of facts, and with those that are being possibly defamed being dead.

  Yes, and on the basis of where we are in the discussion, it's time to pause for a short while, hopefully to await authoritative information to discuss. Though we all like to speculate, and discuss rumours here, this one could cross a line, so let's wait a little...
