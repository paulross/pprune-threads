  Incidental, but I wonder the camera operator was actually trying to capture. Did the aircraft fly into his shot or had something occurred which made him, (sounds like a him), grab his device and start recording? The footage from X is not CCTV, its a hand held device, probably a phone, and not professional. Was capturing the final moments of this unfortunate aircraft a coincidence?

     This is a quote from the sole survivor so don't shoot the messenger: "When the flight took off, within five to 10 seconds it felt like it was stuck in the air. Suddenly, the lights started flickering \x96 green and white \x96 then the plane rammed into some establishment that was there".
     <br/>
     <br/>
     This might indicate evidence of a possible major electrical issue which could have disabled critical aircraft systems.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I've just watched the interview on Sky News. I too picked up on the green and white light coming on. He is sat at an exit so the green and white light is most likely the emergency exit sign illuminating. But on take off? They usually illuminate on electrical power loss.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also states, 'soon after take off . . . maybe 5 to 10 seconds, and it felt like the plane was struck, it felt like something had happened . . . the pilot was trying to give it a bit of a push, but it was struggling . . .'
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Not sure what the witness means by pilot trying to give it a bit of a push, does he perhaps mean he heard the engines getting louder.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  We of course understand witness reliability, particularly with trauma, but he is the only human witness present in the aircraft that is able to speak.

     Because they either fail to read the whole thread or have a preconceived idea that they are not willing to let go off.

   </div>
  </div>
  I think because human error is more palatable than a yet unknown fundamental failing possible in 1100 B787s.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Behind the horror of this accident there will be people and organisations secretly discussing whether to boycott Air India or ground B787s.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the meantime the majority of us are considering the horrendous human cost regardless of the cause being faulty pilots or faulty planes.

     As a witness, I would be shocked if he were not interviewed and every question and response carefully considered. All in good time of course, whereas right now we seem in a hurry for answers, and in that mode, more likely to jump to conclusions than properly arrive at them from evidence.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     That said, the problem with witnesses is that they commonly report what they
     <i>
      expect
     </i>
     to have been rather than what actually was. Years ago, in a carefully staged accident, witnesses were asked to describe what they had seen. The results were startling - at least in as far as they differed widely. This included details which had not been present, interpretations of sights/sounds rather than factual details, and even a number of people who hadn't even been there to actually witness the event first hand, reporting what they had seen 'first hand'.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Witnesses in a situation such as this tend to have strong confirmation bias and can be very unreliable. Not that in this case the survivor should not be taken seriously and respectfully, but that what he can tell investigators will have to be woven into the evidential fabric of the event to make sure the right things can be learned from him
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  On the whole I agree and I say so as a former police officer who interviewed many witnesses, and as a current Barrister candidate, (with 25yrs flying inbetween).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However it is the small details which do not conform to, for instance, a survivors idea of a crash. In this case the detail of a green and white light coming on after take off. I don't speak Gujarati so I rely on the translation of Sky News.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/air-india-plane-crash-only-survivor-thought-he-was-going-to-die-13383080" target="_blank">
   https://news.sky.com/story/air-india...o-die-13383080
  </a>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During the thread it has been stated that the lights were flashing, flickering  or came on and off. The Sky translation states a green and white light came on. I can identify this as the emergency exit sign on the B787. It is located at all exits, one of which the witness was sat at.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I offer no suggestion as to what occurred or why the aircraft crashed. But in considering the available evidence, the illumination, after take off, of a green and white light, identifyable as an emergency exit sign, must be given weight. Further  the functionality of that sign must be examined.

  Very early on I pondered why the person filming the aircraft from a building did so, as have others. Did something specificly out of character cause him to start filming and could that be evidence.

  The answer is no. He was simply in the right place at the wrong time.

     As more days pass without the FAA/EASA issuing an emergency Airworthiness Directive re. the 787 Dreamliner, it does appear more likely the cause of the crash was specific to the Air India aircraft (as per speculation on fuel contamination, bad maintenance, crew error etc. etc.)
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  One would hope, but, whilst there has been confirmation that the EAFRs have been recovered, nothing has been reported about their state or whether they have been downloaded or examined.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If the data is readable there may be a lot of politics and reputation on how that data may be interpreted. Behind the veneer of international cooperation vested interests will be being considered, advocated and agreed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It, unfortunately, is naive to think that politics will not have a silent presence in agreeing a press release. Boeing and GE are flagship USA companies. Air India is the flagship carrier of India.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Investigations of all types first establish what happened, then how and why, before recommendations and actions. There is a possibility that they know the what, but the how and why incur liability.

  An interesting statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Does the statement imply that something noted on the crashed aircraft was not present on the remaining aircraft.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If the investigative team are aware of what happened, are they also aware of why it happened. As noted elsewhere - surely far too soon to be certain. If they are not aware of the why or how, how can they be certain there are no safety deficiencies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Similarily, aircraft and maintainence comply with existing standards. It may well have been the case that existing standards were applied to the crashed aircraft. Does the statement imply that there was nothing wrong with either the Boeing aircraft or the Air India standards. What about the GE engines, are they considered part of the description of both aircraft and standards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Or was the entire exercise merely a
  <acronym title="Google Page Ranking">
   PR
  </acronym>
  wash which achieved nothing other than optics that 787s and Air India are safe because standards are being maintained and aeroplanes have no issues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I'm tempted to read nothing into the statement because it came from the DGCA rather than the AAIB of India.
