    The Indian government is considering grounding Air India&rsquo;s Boeing 787 fleet after one of its planes crashed, killing more than 240 people.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The country&rsquo;s Ministry of Civil Aviation is mulling grounding all Boeing 787-8 Dreamliners as a precautionary measure while a safety review takes place, sources told Indian broadcaster NDTV.

  Reading the various reports about electrical problems on the prior and this flight, such as flickering lights reminded me of the BMI A321 incident discussed here 15 years ago:

  A faulty generator caused all sorts of problems with control of the aircraft.  It is a reminder that complete electrical failure is not the only failure mode.  Shutting down the faulty generator on that aircraft recovered the situation, but they had time and altitude on their side.

     Speculation on my part, the 787 has ceiling lights which change colour/colour can be changed? Could they produce "green flickering" if there were an airframe electrical problem? If the ceiling lights in the whole cabin "flickered green" it sure would be memorable!
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  A Google search for Dreamliner cabin lighting brings up some of the marketing from airlines when the aircraft came into service.  There are a multitude of colours shown.  I recall debate at the time whether it was cool or tacky.

     On the 747, Weight on Wheels (WoW) depends on prox sensors on the landing gear (i.e. gear compression). I don't know how that's done on the 787.
     <br/>
     The reason we used both Radio Alt and WoW is that both can give erroneous indications on certain conditions - RA can be 'fooled' by dense rain or even really dense fog (the signals bounce off the water and falsely indicate on-ground), the prox sensor system can subject to HIRF/Lightning interference.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     TCMA acts quickly, but it does require some persistence, so an input glitch won't activate it (mainly N1, which is measured every 15 milliseconds).
     <br/>
     <br/>
     What sort of 'confirmation' do you have in mind - the regulator mandate that resulted in TCMA basically says we can't take credit for the flight crew.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Where does the logic block that takes the WoW and other inputs to generate the singe air/ground indication live?  Is it somewhere that would be affected by the aircraft power systems?  Could a failure in the aircraft power cause a false ground indication to be sent to the FADECs?

  Gated switches can fail such that the locking function no longer works.  That failure can be the result of physical damage or wear so that the knob is stuck in the pulled position.  It would not be obvious if you did not look closely.  There are two switches of course and it would be disappointing if they were both in that state.

     I\x92ve had a look at the Honeywell spec sheet for TL type switches. They are a common type with many available configurations and are essentially a normal looking snap action switch. The locking feature is an add-on which can be specified. I have to say that from the diagrams, the locking mechanism doesn\x92t look that robust and I\x92d guess that it is subject to wear which was probably the basis of the SAIB. Given that this is a mechanical locking device seeing frequent use possibly with less than full mechanical sympathy it is possible to see how wear could occur. This does beg the question of how whether a check on the mechanism has made it into maintenance routines. ( Note - the locking mechanism appears to be the same for all TL switch types) . Those familiar with the switches - what do you think?
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  The generic version in your drawing has the centre position, whereas the version used on the 787  (4TL837-3D) has centre lockout.  This photo shows the switch.  You can see it is pretty easy to not place it in the locked positions.  With this design of switch the cam on the toggle will eventually wear away.

     How many cycles are they rated for?

   </div>
  </div>
  They comply with a military standard that requires 40,000 cycles though the locking part is tested 20,000 times by just pulling to its full extent.  Or something like that.  How well that testing matches real world use is debatable.

     Yes, seems like they also come in a on-off-on version, but the thing is what could happen when the mechanical function is worn, which is a thing with switches used over time in real world scenarios.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     It seems the design, function and placement of these switches might have been \x93grandfathered\x94 over several generations of cockpit design.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  When they get worn they become easier to force out of the lock position.  But they still retain the normal switch type operation.  Gravity will not be enough to cause a switch (off), you would still need to push it either way.  The spring can fail on this type of switch, that is the spring that pulls the toggle part into the locked position.  Again, it still functions as a switch but the locking is not good.

     I have read most of the thread (old and new). As a lawyer working in forensic investigations, I am constantly involved in problem-solving. My field of work also includes complex investigations related to insolvencies, which almost always require an analysis of the causes behind a specific, established outcome. In doing so, I naturally also have to deal with probabilities. However, it often turns out that the most likely or plausible explanation does not reflect what actually happened.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Many of the considerations I\x92ve read fail because the simultaneous failure of both engines is extremely unlikely, leading to a constant search for higher-order causes. It was suggested that an incorrect altitude setting led to an early thrust reduction. However, this would not explain the deployment of the RAT (Ram Air Turbine), especially since the thrust could have been readjusted. FADEC and TCAM are highly redundant systems, and TCAM failure is unlikely due to WOW (Weight on Wheels) logic, making a simultaneous engine failure after VR equally improbable.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     With that said, and with regard to my question concerning the AD that relates to the fuel control switches (FCS), my thought\x97and it was nothing more than that\x97was that their activation becomes more probable if it can occur accidentally. That\x92s how I came across SAIB: NM-18-33.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Another user then brought up an iPhone. That notion would, of course, be dramatic\x97but how unlikely is it really that after approximately 10,000 actuations between December 2013 and June 2025, the two FCS no longer lock perfectly? Considering all of this, I find it quite conceivable that the A/T slightly reduced thrust in the first seconds after VR (e.g., if an incorrect target altitude had been entered) and that an object lying between the thrust levers and the FCS could have pushed the FCS into the \x93Off\x94 position. Due to the buttons on top of the switches, which provide some resistance, it\x92s even possible that the object both pulled and pushed them.

     But all of this is speculation. The investigation report will bring clarity.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Even if my theory is not confirmed, I still believe that the positioning and mechanism of the FCS are suboptimal. Switches of such critical importance should be better protected, and movements in the area in front of the switches (like reducing thrust) should not follow the same direction as shutting off the fuel supply. A different switching direction alone would provide more safety\x97especially considering that the FCS are protected laterally by metal plates.

  It is probable that the switches are becoming easier to move across the gate after 10,000 operations.  Something falling on them would be a possibility to cause that.  And there is certainly an argument to be had whether down=on is a safer way for them to operate.
