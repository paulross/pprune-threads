     One comment here, and maybe I am mis-understanding your comment, but the landing gear
     <i>
      <b>
       only

     </i>
     operates via the center hydraulics. It does not matter whether the Left/Right engine driven hydraulic systems are operative or not. The RAT will only pressurize the primary flight control portion of the center hydraulics.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Are you saying that the RAT cannot power retraction of the gear, neither via its own hydraulic pump nor via its generator providing power to the centre system pumps?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Or could it be that it's capable of delivering enough power (via either route) to move the tilt actuator but not a humungous retraction jack?

     If a gear retraction remains in "tilt", then what does that

      <i>

     </b>
     ?
     <br/>
     Perhaps the safer solution should be an additional circuitry micro-switch feed of all three "up and locked"? (that agrees with the gear-handle).
     <br/>
     Also waiting to hear what the 787-8 RADALT status is? Was it ever 5G emanations-proofed?
     <br/>
     Is there any software provision for the TCMA to know for sure that the gear is neither up nor down? I would doubt it. Does that uncertainty affect the thrust-lever's positional input?
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  If the 787 is not different to all other aircaft, the WoW senses and putouts only one parameter that is always 1 or 0. There is no netherlands in between. The physical motion the switch is sensing migh have not reach it other end at the time the switch changes its output, but it is irrevelant. If there is a requirement to know that the motion has reaches it\x92s other end, another switch (or other type of sensor) is needed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Using up and locked as signal to prevent TCMA activation is obviously more dangerous as it allows TCMA to function while the aircraft is in the air.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Even in the same aircraft there might be different logics to determin if the aicraft is on the ground or in the air, depending what is the priority. Is the priority to know that the aircraft is in the air or on the ground or even NOT in the air. Some of those logics could use up-and-locked sensors and the gear handle position.

     Rotate vs. Air/Ground Switching Vs Pilot action
     <br/>
     <br/>
     (This is my take, it might seem counterintuitive, if you know better help) On a normal takeoff at rotation, liquids don't slide backward any more than they do during the takeoff roll itself. They slide back during the takeoff roll, and at rotation, there's actually a slight reduction in those backward forces. The main force is still pushing them back, but because the wings are now generating lift, there's more drag than when the plane was just rolling on its wheels. So, if liquids have pooled at the back of something at rotation, during and just after that maneuver, they'll actually ease forward a bit. The main force is still pushing them back, but it's less so. My take is if something sudden happens around rotation, I think it's probably more connected to something like the air/ground sensing or pilot action, but it is still possible that pooled liquids sloshing forward a little could also cause it.
     <br/>
     Pilots have to do a few things at rotate time, pull back in the controls, not the thrust levers in error and then move the landing gear lever. Over the years there's been a few action slips, so unintended control movements.
    </div>
   </div>

  Pooled water around the moisture barrier is just looking for a suitable access point to drain into. The 3 events I am aware of in the B744 were all during manoeuvring, 2 at rotate and one during a descending turn.

    Peak longitudinal acceleration occurs around the time the engines achieve the target N1 (EPR) and decays thereafter, as a function of aerodynamic drag rolling drag and the reduction of the engine net thrust. At rotate, pitching to achieve the target V2+ increment takes acceleration to the TAS increment in the second segment. The change in attitude results in the vertical component from gravity being recorded in the longitudinal axis. The accelerations are around 0.25 at peak and decay to near 0.1 or so at Vr, and then around 0 in the SSL at steady CAS but increasing TAS, can be a slight negative. (If you look at the accelerations on the FDR at 8Hz they are also measuring the

  Based on approximate distances and heights, the time line, the aircraft configuration, surface wind, the published L/D (gear up reduced to a guess for gear down and RAT out), and probable off-optimum speed for maximum L/D in that configuration, it's my opinion (aeronautical engineer, unused ATP rating, and glider pilot, national contests) that we can't rule out both engines being at idle or very low thrust at or shortly after rotation,

     One would hope, but, whilst there has been confirmation that the EAFRs have been recovered, nothing has been reported about their state or whether they have been downloaded or examined.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     If the data is readable there may be a lot of politics and reputation on how that data may be interpreted. Behind the veneer of international cooperation vested interests will be being considered, advocated and agreed.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     It, unfortunately, is naive to think that politics will not have a silent presence in agreeing a press release. Boeing and GE are flagship USA companies. Air India is the flagship carrier of India.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Investigations of all types first establish what happened, then how and why, before recommendations and actions. There is a possibility that they know the what, but the how and why incur liability.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  <br/>
  Investigators will try to establish a single source or truth. For them, that\x92s an ideal outcome. But due to the nature of investigations, the aim gets derailed as established facts versus possible/potential scenarios based on missing links of the chain are pieced together. But for sure, commercial considerations and liability wont enter into a proper investigation. The task of the investigators is to determine the how and why.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Theres a saying, and it may even have been the title of a book\x85 Lift is a gift but Thrust is a must. In this case, certainly one or both were absent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For 2 (maybe 3 if it was a training flight)  professional people, the day started with waking up, getting ready, saying goodbye to loved ones, who they believed they would see again soon in 2-3 days. Sadly, that won\x92t happen, and it\x92s the job of the investigators to find out why and liability isn\x92t a hindrance to them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They will look at every piece of evidence and recreate the events. But it will take time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  information worthy of note is:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A) The gear was still down.
  <br/>
  B) It would appear (due to some work by amazing members) that the RAT was indeed deployed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other observances:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  1. Bits flying off the aircraft. (From experience of operating in this area, they like to fly kites, and waste thermals and floats around, notably plastic bags) I have no idea if that la what we see or not.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  2. Generally in India, they love using their horns. So whilst you can compare the frequencies of a potential RAT to a motorbike, appreciate there would be a million horns going off too.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  3. Some posters have spoken of the \x93startle effect\x94 like they know what they are talking about. The most startling effect of a professional flight deck during an emergency is how calm it is.  There aren\x92t hands flying around everywhere. In fact:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  V1 &gt; Rotate &gt; Positive Rate &gt; Gear Up &gt; Confirm FD/AP Modes is adjusted to:
  <br/>
  V1 &gt; Rotate &gt; Positive Rate &gt; Gear Up &gt; Silence the bell (Or your SOP Variation) FD/AP modes and the PF flies the aircraft.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  the next step is to identify the problem, agree on it and then perform the actions. That won\x92t happen below 400\x92.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  4. There\x92s no company in the world where Pilots are being fed and watered between V1 and 1000\x92 so spilling drinks on run switches isn\x92t a thing on this departure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  5. Temperature inversion. Yes it\x92s possible and it degrades performance. However, if it\x92s present, it\x92s usually announced on the ATIS. IF other aircraft have reported it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  6. Fuel contamination. Without knowing the systems, yes it\x92s potentially possible, but it would appear no other aircraft have reported being affected by it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I think, this accident is especially interesting to Professional Aviators and Engineers because I think none of us would ever believe that it could happen. The aircraft is highly automated, the crew have been properly trained and the operation was a regular or possibly training flight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A query I have is, do later Gen aircraft like the 777/787/747 A330/A350/A380 constantly send Airframe/Engine data home to ops/engineering/oem\x92s. Is it likely the data is out there?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anyway, I just wanted to post this to reassure the travelling public that Pilots don\x92t try to shut down engines before they raise the gear.

  That is one conclusion (which I now suggest is unlikely), because you are assuming:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  1. The hydraulic failure happened exactly when the truck had tilted forward but the split-second before the gear doors could open. That exact timing seems too coincidental.
  <br/>
  2. The crew selected Gear Up. We have no proof of this. I speculate the crew never got as far as "Positive Rate...Gear Up" because they were already engrossed in flying the aircraft and processing their thrust problem. If an electrical problem had developed (as evidenced by the RAT deployment) the flight instrumentation would have been flickering and a flurry of silent master caution alerts would be very distracting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I suggest it's more likely that the truck remained in a forward tilt from the takeoff run because the hydraulic failure happened
  <u>
   prior
  </u>
  to rotation, therefore keeping it in this unusual position. This answer does not rely on the gear lever position either. It also insinuates that their hydraulic problems occurred probably between V1 and VR.

     Most? The Airbus I'm familiar with is 100' AGL or 5s after liftoff and I think this is common to all Airbus FBW. The B787 &amp; B777 appear to be 200' AGL but I'm taking this from online FCOM extracts. The
     <b>
      B737

     does appear to be 400'. Company limitations may be higher.
     <br/>

     As mentioned elsewhere both EK and Air NZ have had messy low level mis-set altitude capture incidents with the B777, but in isolation, obviously, this wouldn't cause RAT extension.

  yeah the low MCP alt setting/alt capture doesn\x92t make a whole lot of sense- the plane didn\x92t pitch forward it just failed to climb/lost lift
  <br/>
  <br/>
  that\x92s not conducive with what happened nor does it explain why the gear is still down (although seemingly selected up given the boogie tilt) or the RAT deployed (if it really was)

     Regarding the momentum: As the first seconds of the climb were normal compared to previous T/Os of the same flight (speed &amp; altitude, confirmed by comparison of the RAW ADS-B data) I don't believe the engine failure happened before or on lift-off.

  I agree with this. For all the SLF reading and not posting ( good work!) there is a delay between the end of the takeoff run and the gear being selected up. I fly 737&rsquo;s so any 78 folk feel free to correct me but it looks like this;
  <br/>
  PM: &ldquo; V1 &hellip;.Rotate&rdquo;
  <br/>
  The PF then begins to rotate the aircraft up to a pre determined attitude which is normally between 13 and 15 degrees. They do this at a rate of between 2 and 3 degrees per second so about 5 or 6 seconds later the aircraft is at its climb out attitude. The PM is then looking at their instruments to confirm that the aircraft has a positive rate of climb, this takes a moment, maybe 1 to 3 seconds then;
  <br/>
  PM &ldquo; positive rate&rdquo;
  <br/>
  PF: &ldquo; gear up&rdquo;.
  <br/>
  So minimum 8 seconds but probably longer between the PM calling &ldquo;rotate&rdquo; and the gear being selected up.
  <br/>
  The relevance of all that is to say that if you suspect that the gear up cycle has been interrupted by a dual engine failure, then the engines may well have been producing thrust up to an altitude of 50-100ft or so, which ties in nicely with the max height reached, distance travelled etc.
  <br/>
  Mods this is clearly not a theory, just info for those who don&rsquo;t fly airliners to aid understanding.

     It doesn't have to be both engines. The loss of one engine with the gear down will still produce the same outcome.
     <br/>
     That still doesn't explain the bogies stowed position for retraction unless there was a total hydraulic failure, which could only occur if the aircraft was despatched with an unserviceable hydraulic system on the live engine side. Which in any case would be a no no.

  The landing gear is run off of the center hydraulic system which is pressurized by electric pumps. The left and right hydraulic systems run their respective thrust reversers and some flight controls, and that is it.

  Thankyou I didn't know that and I'm not questioning you. I guess it doesn't matter electrically driven or engine driven, they cannot share the same power supply the gear must be retracted within 12 seconds. this in my opinion improves the argument for total electrical failure. Unless of course gear up was never selected..There must also have been a substantial loss of thrust on at least one engine.

    A mate tried gear/flap scenario in the sim earlier. Selecting flaps up (all the way) instead of the gear did not predjudice the flight path at all. They selected flaps up at normal gear retraction height and punched the AP in. The Slats remained out until 225kts (as per my post about 50 pages ago) and the aircraft climbed happily away clearing all obstacle by a good margin.

  Was that using the same aircraft weight, same flaps, same ambient temperature and with the same de-rate(s) as the accident flight? Presumably he had inside information to find the appropriate numbers?

     To my mind, this points to a potential software issue. 787s have already suffered from 2 separate software issues in which the passage of time causes a major and possibly catastrophic failure - the need to reboot systems before 51 days and 248 days have elapsed, due to poorly-written software. Given that history, the probability of there being a third, previously-unidentified but broadly similar in nature software issue seems surprisingly high. They aren't independent variables.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Such a passage-of-time software issue wouldn't show up in most (or possibly any) testing scenarios. It is the sort of issue that robust QA and static code analysis are designed to catch. But in at least two separate systems on the 787 it has not been caught prior to software shipping. Meanwhile, every new technical post demonstrates the myriad ways in which non-software potential causes are mitigated by redundant design.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The odds of two (or more) redundant mechanical systems failing in precisely the same way at precisely the same moment are very, very small. The odds of identical software on two (or more) redundant systems reaching a passage-of-time bug at precisely the same moment are, by contrast, very much higher. True redundancy would require different software on each redundant sub-system.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I am a software engineer, I find it alarming that the power control unit had the ability to command all AC generator control units to effectively shut down - regardless of that being the side-effect of a bug, or an ability of the system to call on in appropriate scenarios.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Integer overflow is a specific type of issue common to many systems, but like you said - it is something that should be found with robust QA and analysis. The ability to shut down all generators at once from a single source seems like a risky design decision to me and I agree with your point about different software on 2 or more redundant sub systems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  My theory is that this was an accepted risk because the engine-driven fuel pumps would be more than enough in most phases of flight to keep the engines running, and you would still have 2 engines for redundancy. The APU would also restore AC power in lets say 30 seconds and you would then have electric fuel pumps as well.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I think there are several factors that could explain how loss of all AC power during takeoff could lead to a crash:
  <ul>
   <li>
    The crash happened within 30 seconds - possibly too short for the APU to start, and the RAT doesn't power the AC electric fuel pumps
   </li>
   <li>
    The engine driven fuel pumps even if sufficient in level flight may have struggled during rotation - has Boeing tested an actual takeoff with only EDP feeding the engine while the fuel tanks are rotating and in extreme environments, or, have they only tested this statically?
   </li>
   <li>
    The takeoff was hot and heavy - combined with the landing gear stuck down and reduced thrust from loss of electric fuel pumps could this be enough?
   </li>
  </ul>

  can you ask him by any chance what the outcome would be with f15 or 20 speeds, but in a F5 config and a rotation at VrF15 ?
  <br>
   and retract the flaps to 1 instead of gear ?

    sorry I don\x92t know if that has been tested already.

  I need to correct one of my previous posts, I was going down the path of a mismanaged engine failure after V1, however it's been demonstrated to me that this aircraft will fly away on one engine even with the gear down with better than minimum climb gradient requirement. Quite astonishing actually.
  <br/>
  That just leaves deliberate act not necessarily intentional, fuel vapour lock and automatically commanded engine shutdown.

  I hope the rat is found soon so we know for sure if both engines were in fact lost.

  The 787-8 landing gear retraction is primarily hydraulic, using the center hydraulic system for the main operation. However, the alternate gear
  <i>
   <u>
    extension
   </u>
  </i>
  system utilizes a dedicated electric pump to pressurize fluid from the center hydraulic system for gear extension. Obviously due its size and weight and staged retraction, the effort required to raise and stow the gear greatly exceeds that required for extension.
  <br>
   <br>
    The main gear retraction/extension is controlled by the center hydraulic system.
    <br>
     <br>
      It is apparent that the hydraulics failed when the engines shut down after breaking the down-locks and leaving the Main Landing gear bogeys in the tilt position, ready for a
      <b>
       <i>
        next step
       </i>
      </b>
      internal stowage and door closure (that was now never to happen). It is therefore apparent that the dual engine failure and consequent automated RAT extension was precipitated by this gear selection or retraction cycle and thus likely to be either WoW micro-switch or 5G Radar altimeter-effect associated. Due to accumulator depletion, the electric pump load would have spiked to replenish it. This may have precipitated the dual engine shutdown due to an unfiltered electrical surge affecting the Ground/Air microswitches (or a local 5G transmission affecting the RADALT) and resetting the TCMA.
      <br>
       <br>
        The RADALT? Another plausibility? Because of the furore over a spasticated frequency allocation by the US FCC, the US FAA had finally &ldquo;bought in&rdquo; and declared that individual nations and their airline operators were responsible for their own 5G frequency spectrum allocations and for taking essential steps to ensure mitigation of the interference effects upon aircraft automated landings and other
        <i>
         critical systems
        </i>
        caused by their own national approved 5G spectrum decisions. It was admittedly a situation calling for extensive modifications to (and shielding for) the three radar altimeters fitted for redundancy considerations to all modern airliners... for Category 3 ILS approach and landing in zero/zero visibility conditions.  The RADALT also features in many air-ground sensing applications. (eg the 747-8).
        <br>
         <br/>
         This was an unusual FAA
         <i>
          &ldquo;passing of the buck&rdquo;
         </i>
         to manufacturers such as Honeywell etc. (to sort out with client operators). But then again, it was not the US FCC&rsquo;s right to dictate the specific 5G frequencies internationally. These spectrum allocations now vary over the wide selection of 5G phones available (and also nationally). 5G Radar Altimeters constitute a part of the ground/Air sensing that changes the TCMA from ground mode (able to fuel-chop engines) to the air mode (inhibited from doing so)... Ground activation is acceptable ...where fuel chopping of uncommanded thrust can prevent runway sideways excursions or runway length overruns. The question now becomes: &ldquo;Is it more (or less) safe having an automated fuel-chopping capability on BOTH your left and right, rather than leaving it to the pilot to react via his center console fuel cut-off switches... in the unlikely event of a runaway engine after landing (or during an abandoned take-off)?
         <br/>
         <br/>
         <b>
          5G Frequency Variations
         </b>
         <br/>
         <br/>
         The frequencies of 5G phones vary nationally based on the frequency bands allocated and used by different carriers in each country. In the United States, for example, carriers such as AT&amp;T, Verizon, T-Mobile, and others use a combination of low-band, mid-band, and high-band 5G frequencies.
         <b>
          Low-band 5G frequencies typically range from 600 MHz to 1 GHz, mid-band 5G frequencies range from 1.7 GHz to 2.5 GHz, and high-band 5G (mmWave) frequencies start at 24 GHz and go up to 40 GHz
         </b>
         . These frequencies are allocated by regulatory bodies such as the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and can vary between countries based on spectrum availability and regulatory decisions. In other countries, the specific frequency bands used for 5G may differ, leading to variations in the frequencies supported by 5G phones. Additionally, the deployment of 5G networks can also influence the frequencies used, with some countries focusing more on sub-6 GHz bands while others prioritize mmWave technology.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         5G interference? It may be an avenue worth exploring?

  @ferry pilot and others who mentioned the seat back collapsing: That was from an entirely unrelated incident on Air India Express flight 611 in 2018 which got poorly rehashed / fakenewsed into a bogus theory over the last week. It was a 737. It did *not* happen on AI171.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For what it's worth, the AIX 611 story in 2018 involved a 737 captain's seat back being overtightened and suddenly collapsing backwards during the takeoff roll. He had been guarding the thrust levers and reflexively grabbed them when falling back, causing a thrust reduction from 98% N1 to 75% N1 or thereabouts. Control was immediately transferred to the other pilot but the inadvertent thrust change was not corrected immediately, and the plane took off a few seconds later with a tail strike, scraping the runway, flying through the localizer and demolishing part of the airport perimeter wall with its landing gear. During the climb, the flight crew ran several system checks and landing gear tests to reassure themselves the plane was fine, then proceeded with the flight, pressurizing the aircraft and whatnot. They evidently did not consult the tail strike procedure. Many hours later they were ordered by company to divert and land quickly after the damage was seen at the airport. After landing, the plane was found to have a fair bit of damage, including part of the perimeter wall's barbed wire fencing material wrapped around the landing gear. But zero injuries, and the plane was fixed and flew again.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's an entertaining story because of the cause and the happy ending, but had nothing to do with AI171, for which we all await the preliminary report.

     Early during the 787 flight testing phase (9 Nov 2010) before the battery fire escapades, there was an electrical fire aboard aircraft ZA002 that had potential for serious consequences.
     <br/>
     From memory, the 787 electrical distribution does not involve electro-mechanical contactors but instead uses solid state devices that are controlled by software.
     <br/>
     The Air India accident aircraft was experiencing electrical problems in the cabin on the prior flight according to passenger reports.
     <br/>
     Were these problems addressed or where they non-MEL items?
     <br/>
     The accident aircraft seems to have experienced a significant electrical event coincident with transition from Ground to Air mode (which I would expect results in some software reconfiguration of the aircraft electrical system).
     <br/>
     If the ground to air transition momentarily activated a grounded electrical system, then there could be a rather large plasma cloud of vaporized metal surrounding adjacent wires which could send electrical power to places it would not normally go.
     <br/>
     Swiss Cheese model anyone?

  Very interesting. Pal of mine used to fly. Caught up with him last night over text. This is what he said:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  \x93An aircraft can be in service for many years before supposedly 'random' failures are discovered. We had a 747-400 departing JNB many years ago, and during the take off roll, the inboard leading edge flaps (flaps on the Jumbo, not slats) retracted. The only indication of this was the flaps secondary display popping up and crosses appearing over the inboard LE flaps. No Master Caution, no warnings of any kind. Apparently the system was working exactly as 'designed\x92!
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During the landing roll, when Reverse is selected, the inboard LE flaps automatically retract, to avoid damage from any debris blown up by the effect of the reverse thrust.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In this take off scenario, due to maintenance work being carried out earlier in the day, the aircraft thought the reversers had been selected, and 'correctly' retracted the flaps. At rotation, the stick shaker activated, and the aircraft struggled to get airborne. The passengers got lucky, as the First Officer, who was Pilot Handling, was an experienced aerobatic pilot, and was able to keep the aircraft airborne, flying in heavy buffet and with the stick shaker activated until the air-ground logic finally caught up after gear retraction, and the LE flaps deployed again.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Not something that most regular guys would cope with, particularly at night, with no outside horizon for reference. Pilots who\x92ve operated around Africa will know what I'm talking about.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They dumped fuel and returned to JNB.
  <br/>
  This happened on May 11th 2009 (Google it) - just how long had the Jumbo, of all variants, been in service before this 'glitch' was discovered?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The actual issue was that during the earlier maintenance, the engineers had cycled the thrust levers, with the engines off, all the way through the reverse gates, and back again (the aircraft had arrived earlier that day, and a reverser had failed to deploy). What no one knew, was that the action of moving the thrust levers through the reverse gate, would latch a bit of software logic in one of the computers on board, causing a near catastrophic sequence of events.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  We all know and love the Jim Reason Swiss cheese model - I suspect we're going to discover some previously unknown holes.\x94
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I find it rather a coincidence that this aircraft had so many electrical problems, had, not been retrofitted to solve one electrical issues like all 787s in the US had, and suffered what appears to be some kind of electrical failure.

  I recommend that everyone look at the video posted by Sawbones62 in
  <a href="https://www.pprune.org/11905550-post498.html" target="_blank">
   this post
  </a>
  . The video (Stig Shift #76) is by a qualified B787 engineer and he looks at the various aircraft systems that are being discussed in the Air India accident. With respect to the landing gear, he concludes that the landing gear handle must have been selected up for the bogies to have been tilted front down.
