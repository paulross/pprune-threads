  I think you missed the point of his question.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Because there are some times that the gear is left down after take-off for operational reasons. An automatic retraction is not desirable because the PF needs to know there is a positive rate of climb before calling for gear up, lest the beast settle back on to runway.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Have a look at Emirates in Dubai&hellip;

  This was a go round accident but the positive rate principle is the same.

     Just out of interest as the aircraft rotates and gets airborne won&rsquo;t the twin main biggest not already be in a noe down attitude and the first stage of raising the gear just ensures it&rsquo;s there and locked before retraction?
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  The 787-8 gear goes through the following movements on TO:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  1. During rotation all 4 main wheels on each gear truck stay on the runway, the gear acts as a pivot point for the rotation. Effectively the gear truck is in a forward tilt as it is no longer parallel to the fuselage.
  <br/>
  2.
  <strike>
   Once
  </strike>
  As the wheels lift off the runway, the trucks tilt rearward (this is the normal extended gear in air position, like on approach)
  <br/>
  3. When the pilot commands gear up, the gear retraction sequence begins, specific to the 787-8, the gear trucks tilt forwards first, instantly followed by the gear doors opening.

   See this post

  which discusses the forward tilt is either caused by process (1) or process (3). I suggest (1) is more likely than (3).

  Well, in the context of the systems we're talking about here, why would it?  The requirement is to "know" the actual air/ground state of the aircraft.  The position of the gear lever doesn't help with that and might, if part of the voting, contribute to misidentification of that state.

  Just to summarize. There appears to be fairly wide consensus as to what happened:
  <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
   <li>
    Up to V1 it appeared normal and the pilots did not abort.
   </li>
   <li>
    Loss of thrust very close to V2 rotate or shortly thereafter.
   </li>
   <li>
    Loss of electrical and hydraulics resulting in deployment of RAT seconds after being airborne.
   </li>
   <li>
    Mayday transmission seconds after takeoff (although it may have occurred around V2, the timing has not been established).
   </li>
   <li>
    Gear tilted forward suggesting gear retraction was initiated but not completed.
   </li>
   <li>
    All followed by glide to impact from AGL of little more than 100 feet.
   </li>
  </ol>
  Why the above happened is rather less clear. In my opinion, fuel contamination/starvation, water, additive, vapour or otherwise, may have affected thrust during takeoff before resulting in total loss of thrust and electrical power. On the other hand, software/electrical fault would more likely have resulted in a sudden loss of the engines.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On that basis, there is still some mileage in establishing the aircraft speed in the last moments before takeoff. There is definitely mileage in identifying a single point of failure that would cause the engines to shut down; other than fuel contamination/vapour issues. I suspect that the official investigation is not all that further ahead of this thread. Without useful data from the
  <span style="color:#474747">
   EAFR they have to rely on forensics and history. Enough has been leaked to know the engines were no more than windmilling at impact.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A high level of interest will continue given there are still remaining questions whether the reliability of Boeing machinery is implicated. That is not to mention the hundreds of people closely affected by this tragedy that are looking for reasons why it happened. Perhaps an interim report is now overdue?

  The issues with the "they shut down the wrong engine" theory:
  <br/>
  1. No asymmetry evidence with flight path deviation. No roll, no yaw effects
  <br/>
  2. No rudder inputs visible.
  <br/>
  3. No crew should be doing memory items below 400ft. Boeing requires each crew member confirm together memory item switch/control selections.
  <br/>
  4. Non-normal gear truck tilt position, a one engine failure should not affect the C hydraulics. As per (3) gear would be selected Up before any memory actions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The evidence so far is an almost simultaneous dual engine failure, which rules out alot of other theories.

  The gear tilt position is not definitive evidence crew had selected gear up. I've speculated another cause for this non-normal gear tilt is that C hydraulics failed around time of rotation. This would explain the gear remaining in the forward tilt position. There are reasons why the crew may have not selected gear up,

     Therefore we cannot determine wow or air/ground logic from an assumed gear retraction.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Further to the (logical in my view) points you make in response to AAKEE's ostensibly logical conclusion that the commencement of undercarriage retraction (if it did commence) is conclusive of the aircraft being 'in the air' for aircraft systems purposes, including TCMA purposes, I make the following points:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  First, whilst it may be that every system that monitors and makes decisions about whether the aircraft is 'in the air' does so on the basis of exactly the same sensor inputs, that may not be true and I'd appreciate someone with the expert knowledge on the 78 to confirm or refute the correctness of the assumption, particularly in relation to, for example, FADEC functions compared with undercarriage control functions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Secondly and probably more importantly, what happens if one of the sensors being used to determine 'in air' versus 'on ground' gives an erroneous 'on ground' signal
  <i>
   after
  </i>
  - maybe just seconds after - every one of those sensors has given the 'in air' signal?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Reference was made earlier in this thread to a 'latched' in air FADEC condition that resulted in engine shut downs after the aircraft involved landed and was therefore actually on the ground. But what if some sensor failure had resulted in the aircraft systems believing that the aircraft was now on the ground when it was not? I also note that after the 2009 B737-800 incident at Schiphol &ndash; actually 1.5 kms away, where the aircraft crashed in a field during approach - the investigation ascertained that a RADALT system suddenly sent an erroneous minus 8&rsquo; height reading to the automatic throttle control system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The conceptual description of the TCMA says that the channels monitor the &ldquo;position of thrust lever&rdquo; &ndash; no surprises there &ndash; &ldquo;engine power level&rdquo; &ndash; no surprises there &ndash; and &ldquo;several other digital inputs via digital ARINC data buses&rdquo;.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  WoW should of course be one of those "digital inputs" and be a 1 or 0. But I haven't seen any authoritative post about whether the change in state on the 78 requires only one sensor to signal WoW or if, as is more likely, there are (at least) two sensors &ndash; one on each MLG leg &ndash; both of which have to be &lsquo;weight off&rsquo; before a weight off wheels state signal is sent. Maybe a sensor on each leg sends inputs to the ARINC data and the systems reading the data decide what to do about the different WoW signals, as between 00, 01, 10 and 11.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There is authoritative information to the effect that RADALT is also one of the &ldquo;digital inputs&rdquo; to the TCMA. The RADALTs presumably output height data (that is of course variable with height) and I don&rsquo;t know whether the RADALT hardware involved has a separate 1 or 0 output that says that, so far as the RADALT is concerned, the aircraft to which it is strapped is, in fact, &lsquo;in the air&rsquo; at &lsquo;some&rsquo; height, with the actual height being so high as to be irrelevant to the systems using that input (if that input is in fact generated and there are, in fact, systems that use that 1 or 0).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If we now consider the &lsquo;worst case scenario will be preferred&rsquo; concept that apparently applies to the TCMA design so as to achieve redundancy, the number of sensor inputs it&rsquo;s monitoring to decide whether, and can change its decision whether, the aircraft is on the ground, becomes a very important matter. The TCMA is only supposed to save the day on the ground, if the pilots select idle thrust on a rejected take off but one or both of the engines fail to respond. In the &lsquo;worst case&rsquo; (in my view) scenario, both TCMA channels on both engines will be monitoring/affected by
  <i>
   every
  </i>
  WoW sensor output and
  <i>
   every
  </i>
  RADALT output data and, if
  <i>
   any one of them
  </i>
  says &lsquo;on ground&rsquo;, that will result in
  <i>
   both
  </i>
  engines&rsquo; TCMAs being enabled to command fuel shut off, even though the aircraft may, in fact, be in the air.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Of course it&rsquo;s true that the TCMA&rsquo;s being enabled is not, of itself, sufficient to cause fuel cut off to an engine. That depends on a further glitch or failure in the system or software monitoring engine power and thrust lever position, or an actual &lsquo;too much thrust compared to thrust lever position&rsquo; situation. But I can&rsquo;t see why, on balance, it&rsquo;s prudent to increase the albeit extraordinarily remote risk of an &lsquo;in air&rsquo; TCMA commanded engine or double engine shut down due to multiple sensor failure &ndash; just one in-air / on-ground sensor and one of either the thrust lever sensor/s or engine power sensor/s &ndash; or, in the case of an actual in air &lsquo;too much thrust compared to thrust lever position situation&rsquo;, why that &lsquo;problem&rsquo; could not be handled by the crew shutting down the engine when the crew decides it&rsquo;s necessary. Once in the air, too much thrust than desired is a much better problem to have than no thrust. The latter is precisely what would happen if all &lsquo;on ground / in air&rsquo; sensors were functioning properly and some &lsquo;too much thrust&rsquo; condition occurred.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hopefully the design processes, and particularly the DO-178B/C software design processes done by people with much bigger brains than mine, have built in enough sanity checking and error checking into the system, followed by exhaustive testing, so as to render my thoughts on the subject academic.

     The issues with the "they shut down the wrong engine" theory:
     <br/>
     1. No asymmetry evidence with flight path deviation. No roll, no yaw effects
     <br/>
     2. No rudder inputs visible.
     <br/>
     3. No crew should be doing memory items below 400ft. Boeing requires each crew member confirm together memory item switch/control selections.
     <br/>
     4. Non-normal gear truck tilt position, a one engine failure should not affect the C hydraulics. As per (3) gear would be selected Up before any memory actions.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The evidence so far is an almost simultaneous dual engine failure, which rules out alot of other theories.

  This was already addressed in one of tdracer's posts about the TCMA system: the air/ground decision is made by the aircraft itself (using multiple redundant inputs and voting logic), and only a single air/ground binary state is provided to the EEC(FADEC). Further, he also stated that the EEC assumes "air", as that is the safer state given the nature of its operations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Based on this, both engines will get the same air/ground indication from the aircraft and hence will always make the same TCMA decisions (subject to their individual throttle positions and thrust outputs).

  Yes, all true. And I didn't think your earlier post was incredible, just that it was an exercise not intended to explain
  <i>
   everything
  </i>
  about air/ground logic.  I think that, in the real world, it's most likely that the air/ground decision will take inputs from other sensors, not just WoW.  Radio altimeters seem the most likely choice and we've been told they've been used on earlier Boeings (which I think I already knew or assumed).  I'd certainly feel safer with that arrangement.

     The gear tilt position is not definitive evidence crew had selected gear up. I've speculated another cause for this non-normal gear tilt is that C hydraulics failed around time of rotation. This would explain the gear remaining in the forward tilt position. There are reasons why the crew may have not selected gear up,

     Therefore we cannot determine wow or air/ground logic from an assumed gear retraction.

  Without knowing the 787-8 gear system, we know that is is supposed to be hydraulically moved from \x94nose up\x94 to nose down as the first step in the gear up sequence. But do we know that it would end up \x94nose down\x94 without hyd pressure?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another point pointing to that the aircraft did consider itself being \x94In Air\x94 is the ADS-B data sending Altitude from the first 575 feet at

   08:08:46.55 until at least 08:50.87\x85?

   I would think the sub systems like TCMA would use the same In Air / On Ground logic as the aircraft normally use?
   <br/>
   I come from an FBW aircraft with a Air/Ground logic that seems rather bullet proof and would
   <b>
    guess
   </b>
   the 787 wouldn\x92t use a less solid logic which probably, in doubt would consider it being \x94In Air\x94?
   <br/>
   It would be \x94logic\x94 for the TCMA to use this logic?

     But at this point it&rsquo;s wayyyyyyy too early to do any Boeing Bashing based on an accident none of us have any clue as to the cause.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Indian media has been reporting all week that the DGCA said only 24 of Air India's 33 Boeing 787 aircraft had passed an "enhanced safety inspection" it had ordered the airline to carry out. What this actually means is one third of the 787 fleet didn't pass safety inspections. 7 were in fact grounded. Possible incompetency in maintenance, or/and maintenance that is increasingly required due to incompetency in design, manufacturing and inferior components, for reasons I&rsquo;ll explain further down.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Even before the crash, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) had warned Air India of multiple safety protocol violations after three of its planes continued operations despite pending security checks of emergency systems. This warning was issued days before the Ahmedabad Air India Plane crash. In one case an AI plane flew to destinations such as Dubai, Riyhad and Qatar despite a 1 month delay in carrying out mandatory inspections. Indian Media has reported numerous instances of AI planes failing Pre-flight inspections and Daily/Turnaround inspections that are crucial before every flight, and still flying.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In fact, Air India has long suffered from numerous technical failures, creaky aircraft and demoralised staff, even before the disastrous crash, and certainly since.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On 10th March:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - AI125 (Chicago to Dehli) was forced to turn around after 5 hours
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On 16th June:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - Al315 (Hong Kong to Delhi) returned to base due to technical snags that the pilots decided weren&rsquo;t safe to fly with
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - Al9695 (Delhi to Ranchi) returned to base due to technical snags that the pilots decided weren&rsquo;t safe to fly with
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - A BA Boeing 787 was forced to turn back to London
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On 17th June:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - Al159, the rebranded Al171, was cancelled due to the replacement aircraft being unavailable due to technical trouble
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - Al180 from San Francisco to Mumbai was grounded in Kolkata due to engine trouble.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On 20th June:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - 8 AI flight routes (4 international, 4 domestic) have been cancelled due to failing safety checks imposed after Ahmedabad crash
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - 15% of all AI international flights have been cancelled until at least mid July
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Problems are reported in Indian media to be deep and structural. From Indian bureaucracy (Babudom), prevalent in both public, ex public and recently privatised sectors, poor work ethics, an &ldquo;it will do&rdquo; (chalta hai) culture, bullying and hierarchical workplace, to paying lip service to maintenance and health and safety. Indian media has reported grave safety concerns surfacing within Air India, with whistleblowers accusing the airline of negligence and misconduct. Captain Sivaran was sacked for raising safety issues, after refusing to fly illegally with issues that compromised passenger safety, including emergency oxygen deployment not passing safety tests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Previously Government owned, Air India was privatised and taken over by Tata, who are notorious for cost cutting and infamous for poor health and safety records. Indian media have reported that the Engineering department responsible for maintenance and passing technical inspections had their salary frozen despite rampant inflation, had staff cut, and had all their benefits removed. Many workers have apparently (according to my Indian friends) more or less given up on their work, and were just passing the documents because they had neither the manpower nor the time to do them, and were under intense pressure by management to pass them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Air India had a Turkish contractor at Ahmedabad to maintain their widebodies, which they abruptly dropped around 2 weeks ago, apparently because Turkey refused to ditch its cordial relations with Pakistan. Who took this contract over and what capacity they had to do so is unclear because AI have so far refused to comment or answer questions specifically on this.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the meantime, Tata have been serving defamation lawsuits in India on any news organisation that dares to criticise them for anything. They have a long history of doing this.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It&rsquo;s important to note that all this is happening while 53% of posts at the DGCA remain vacant, along with 35% of posts at the bureau of civil aviation security and 17% of posts at the airports authority of India.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite all this, the Indian PM Modi has a very aggressive target of reaching 240mn air passengers annually by the end of this year, rising to 500mn by 2030, and a tripling of cargo capacity from 3.5 million metric tonnes by the end of this year to 10 million metric tonnes. This is merely exacerbating the problems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And then there&rsquo;s the plane type itself. The 787-8 has 9 Technical safety issues per million Flight hours. Technical safety issues are faults that comprise the safe operation of the flight. The A350, by contrast, has 0.3 Technical safety issues per million Flight hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the 787, this equates to 3.8 technical diversions per 100 aircraft annually. For the A350, it equates to 0.13 technical diversions per 100 aircraft annually, or 1 technical diversion every 8 years across 100 aircraft. Examining publicly available Airline Performance Reliability Metrics, we can see much less of a variance with the A350 across airlines when compared to 787-8 across airlines and tiers, and a much lower rate of faults by factors of 50-100.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The A350 design is maintenance friendly, meaning the plane is reliable independent of operator tier. The 787-8 design is exposed to quality of maintenance. Boeing planes have an uncomfortably high rate of background faults meaning they need to rely on the redundant systems far more often than their competitors such as Airbus. Despite the 737 Max crashes we continue to see Boeing planes experience much higher levels of system faults and failures in its flagship products. This level of acceptance of systemic failures leaning on the redundant systems for normal operation creates situations where multiple catastrophic failures are increasingly possible.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  You might think the above data could be biased by the battery issues that plagued Dreamliners early on, and led to them being grounded for a short period. However, if you examine the data, rather than seeing lower issues we see continual concerning noise of similar peaks, with higher rates in recent years, even after the battery issues were apparently addressed in 2013. So the 787-8 has a noisy gremlin baseline of issues - something we don't see in the Airbus products. If we dig into the public data, we can see that the vast majority of these issues are engine and electrical related. Not a shock in itself, given the heavy electrical design of the plane. Thanks to the testimony of Boeing whistleblower Sam Salehpour, we know that Boeing used improper techniques to ground electrical systems on the 787. This can lead to arcing, overheating, and potential fire hazards&mdash;all of which we&rsquo;ve seen cause problems on multiple occasions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It doesn't seem to matter which engine type is installed, the Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 or GE GenX1B, by the way. When normalised for fleet distribution, both variants show around 2.5 events per million flight hours. That strongly suggests the problem isn't engine related. It's the integration between the engines and the 787s electrical architecture.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  We know that various electrical systems on this particular plane were non operational, and that an ex crew member has said that this plane had long been plagued with electrical issues. I&rsquo;ve heard lots of people say that this doesn&rsquo;t matter, because they&rsquo;re on separate systems to the engines due to redundancy, so it&rsquo;s ok. But that&rsquo;s not strictly true, once you understand how the redundancy works. What it effectively means you&rsquo;ve removed a layer of redundancy, and you are relying on that redundancy just to be able to fly normally. This means that the Swiss cheese already has two or more holes lined up, and your redundancy is no longer as deep.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Redundant systems exist to catch rare failures. 1 in a million anomalies that slip through every other safeguard. They are meant to back up a reliable system, not compensate for frequent faults. Planes should not be designed to run frequently on redundancy. In aviation you evaluate a highly redundant yet failure-prone aircraft not just on whether it stays aloft, but on reliability and maintainability metrics, such as meantime between failures, Technical safety issues per million Flight hours, and other airline performance metrics, almost all of which the 787, and other Boeing planes, have a far higher rate of than their Airbus competitors. No one should be accepting multiple faults as okay simply because redundancies are there to protect the passengers. And yet that appears to be the case in the 787-8.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Compact Air Compressors (CAC) are 4 individual units. Their role isn't just passenger comfort. They regulate cabin pressure, temperature and cool down key electrical systems, which is critical. With nearly a megawatt of electricity flowing through the aircraft, heat becomes a serious issue. If it isn't dissipated properly, it can cause component degradation, arcing or even shutdowns&mdash;sound familiar?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  DC behaviour can be unstable. Arcing that doesn't want to stop. Arcing and insulation isn&rsquo;t always a good combination. Insulation materials do not like heat, and arcs produce a lot of it in very short time frames. If you are short-circuiting a fine signal wire with a thick power transmission cable (like the supply for entertainment system), there's no fuse or circuit breaker designed to protect this fine wire. The fine wire may become a fuse. This means the wire, for its full length, may change its state from solid to plasma. As this wire is not protected inside a low pressure glas cylinder like a real fuse, the insulation will become a mix of solid, liquid, gas and plasma. Neighbouring insulation probably too. We know a cable can overheat and melt the insulation of two redundant sensors at the same time. The SA 111 fire was due to arcing in a faulty entertainment system (sound familiar?). All this wiring from all these redundant systems comes together in some places to the same devices, such as the display showing the pilots the engine parameters.

  Let&rsquo;s say a single Variable Speed Frequency Generator (VSFGs) fails and the system isolates it. The Generator Control Breaker (GCB) opens, cutting the failure fail generator off from the 235 volt BUS. The BUS Power Control Units (BPCU) are in charge of parcelling DC distribution, which enable BUS isolation and linking BUSes together. Power is automatically rerouted via BUS Tie Breakers (BTBs) and the remaining three generators, or the Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) if needed, to pick up the load. The Electrical Load Management System (ELMS) may shed non-essential loads like galley ovens, inflight entertainment and passenger AC, but primary flight systems stay online. Sound familiar?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The crew sees an alert but there's no loss of function. Pressurisation, flight controls, anti-ice etc. all continue uninterrupted. If both generators on one side go down, it&rsquo;s serious. The entire sides 235VT AC BUS drops. In response the right side generators and/or reroute power across the backup BUS path via isolation relays. If the APU isn't available, the Ram Air Turbine (RAT) deploys, automatically feeding emergency power into the system. The switch happens in under a second, quick enough to avoid flight critical interruptions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If a CAC overheats, over speeds, or loses turbo pressure, the system shuts it down. The opposite side CAC kicks in automatically to handle cabin pressurisation and thermal loads, and the ELMS adjusts the outflow valves or reduces pack flow as needed. Passengers may notice a shift in cabin temperature or pressure but no immediate safety is compromised.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In rarer cases, where both CACs on one side fail, that side's Environmental Control System (ECS) goes offline. ELMS quickly boosts output from the remaining side to stabilise conditions. Anti-ice and other systems may be throttled back to preserve cabin integrity. Climb or descent rates might slow but again the plane keeps flying. If both engine generators fail mid-flight the RAT deploys within seconds. It starts delivering around 30 kilovolt amps, just enough to keep the backup BUS, CACs and Transformer Rectifier Units (TCU)s alive. Once the Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) spins up and takes over, the RAT retracts automatically. That transition typically takes about 1 to 2 minutes&mdash; not ideal but survivable, given enough altitude. But more flight critical electrical systems potentially aren&rsquo;t being cooled enough. The holes in the Swiss cheese are being aligned.

  On paper Boeing's electrical power architecture should never cascade into a total failure. Cross ties, smart load shedding, redundant processes and trip curves all exist to stop one fault from spiralling into another. Yet there is at least 1 constant risk: Simultaneous Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC) Protect Idle. Basically it&rsquo;s the equipment of &ldquo;limp home" mode in a car ECU.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  FADEC is the electronic engine control computer. In certain DC side faults both FADECs, one to each engine, can perceive a loss of power, and command engines into protect idle. This flight idle schedule is 25 to 30% of N1, which I believe is about 8% of max thrust, designed to protect against over speed or surge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Taken together the apparently most probable sequence - the RAT deploying, the engines spooling to idle, an inability to retract the gear - could be explained by an edge case - a full AC generation failure followed by a brief 28 volt DC sag tripping both Direct Memory Access (DMA) and DC channels on each FADEC, and forcing protect idle fuel schedules mid-takeoff.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This could be from any number of electrical issues, such a transient high load sag - during a hot day, a high power event, gear retraction, avionics peak loads etc. The chances of this are of course exacerbated if one or more VSFG LS or CACS are already out, as seems plausible in this case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Perhaps someone can help me here please? I believe the monitoring systems on a Boeing 787 sample the electrical system voltages and currents at a relatively high frequency. This gives the potential to over-react to a transient event by taking immediate action instead of waiting a short time before re-sampling again. There is the possibility of the Bus Tie Contactor (BTC) closing, something fairly fundamental to the electrical system. The 787 uses variable frequency AC generators whose outputs are rectified and then inverted to other AC voltages and high DC voltages, some in the 250-300V region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The DC BUS voltage could drop below the under voltage threshold. At same time the engine's DMA's output can sag; it&rsquo;s rectifier sees too low an AC input, so both channel A and channel B sense a low voltage. Alternatively, a shared harness or ground fault, to two sensing circuits that share a common power quality filter and grounding path in the Forward equipment bay. In this case, a single heavy chafe, splice failure, or melted connector, upstream of both sense lines, can remove the sense reference for both channels, making them think the voltage dropped out. Another possibility is a solid state controller reset; a VSFG contactor arc, or a Transient Rectifier Unit (TRU) can momentarily reset the upstream power converters. If both the DMAs built-in rectifier and TRU's electronics are held in reset by the same transient, for example by a very big VSFG arc, both channels will indicate loss until the converters restart. Yet another possibility is water damage, or a lithium battery fire damage (sound familiar?) in an electrical connector, for example shorting the 28V DC BUS for the Electronic Throttle System (ETS) which controls thrust, which means it can&rsquo;t talk to the FADEC, prompting Protect Idle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Does anyone know how Boeing, Regulators and/or Airline test electrical/computer interactions in the 787 involving arcing/shorting voltage/current transient testing across and upstream from FADEC? The Electronic Engine Controls (EECs) and FADECs in the engines are self-powered via magnetos and self-controlling in many circumstances, but perhaps something like the above occurred, due to the effect of electrical transients on the various signals received by the EECs. The code in FDACs is only made to cover problems the programmers have thought of and are testable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  You can detect a non-fictional sensor (such as a broken wire) or one where there are the two signal wires short circuiting each other, because both scenarios deliver known values. But if, for example, an analogue sensor outputting a specific voltage on a specific value like engine core temperature (say 1V on 50 degrees, 8V on 500 degrees, 12V on 1000 degrees) and you shortcut two sensors at the same time with a power supply wire, that delivers stable 12V, the input will read for both computers a plausible vale of 1000 degrees, a overheating engine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Of all these, the most likely scenario is still a real dual sag: a momentary high demand spike that drags both the DMA AC output and the 28vt DC BUS below their thresholds for long enough&mdash;approximately 200 to 300 milliseconds&mdash;that the BPCUs see it as a true loss of both channels. The RAT automatically deploys in under two seconds when both main AC buses drop. I believe someone here has already asked the question of how aircraft engines might react to a transient power fault. With engines idle, I believe hydraulic electric pumps lose their power so the crew couldn't retract the gear.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  IMO, the available information about the aircraft type and it&rsquo;s past and current issues, the individual aircraft itself and it&rsquo;s past issues, and the airline and airport and their issues, point towards an extreme Swiss cheese alignment of electrical faults in hot and humid high power conditions, possibly causing a software glitch, potentially exacerbated by poor maintenance and design/manufacturing. This catastrophic electrical anomaly may have forced both FADECS into protect idle producing the observed flight profile.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The background noise of gremlins in a 787's electrical and engine systems is concerning. When your platform accumulates sporadic faults the probability, however minor, of a full electrical collapse is no longer zero. Continually relying on redundancy systems for operational flight massively increases the risk.
