  - fuel cut offs were found in the RUN position

  <br/>
  - on take off roll both engines lost power as the fuel cut offs went from RUN to cutoff
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - CVR recorded one pilot asking why they had gone to CUTOFF
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - within 10 seconds the fuel cutoff was moved back to RUN

  -RAT was deployed, APU had begun auto start

  - 32 seconds after Vr the MAYDAY was called

  <br/>
  This should also dispel a lot of the comments about AAIB-India, Indian culture in general and general competence. For a preliminary report this is far more thorough and extensive than what would normally be expected and they\x92ve kept Boeing, GE, FAA and investigators from US, UK, Canada and Portugal in the loop from the start
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They have also clarified why it took so long to do the EAFR download- because of the extensive damage they had to source specialist equipment from the NTSB that only arrived on the 23rd of June (they downloaded on the 24th) so all that talk of a \x91coverup\x92 is pretty embarrassing now
  <br/>
  <br/>
  of course the big question is why/how those switches were commanded into cutoff in the first place  the exact sequence at Vr is the most critical, there hasn\x92t been much scrutiny at all that I can see in the Indian/international media of the personal
  <br/>
  background of the flight deck crew which has happened in other suspected pilot initiated disasters in the past, I guess this is an avenue investigators will have been doing themselves

     The switch state could be either on or off in that position. However, the CVR makes it pretty clear that the switches were moved deliberately to off. Just not why. Also, remember the report says one switch was moved then the other. Not together.

  <br/>
  Does anyone know what the sampling frequency of the data is? If we get one readout per second, then it's possible that a one second difference could only be a millisecond difference in real life, which doesn't necessarily rule out an accidental bump.
  <br/>
  If there truly was a second of difference, there aren't many other options than an intentional act. Not necessarily with the purpose of crashing the plane though (confusion, hallucination, distraction, ..)

  I remember the SAIB. I assessed it as &ldquo;recommended&rdquo; to all our customers and all agreed. I then raised work orders to check all fuel cut-off switches for the missing locking bar conditions. None were found defective. The preliminary report says the switches were found in the Run position. There is no mention of whether the locking mechanism is correctly in place. We need to wait for the full report for that, as this matter is still under investigation.

  The phrase in the report is "switches transitioned from RUN to CUTOFF position".
  <br/>
  Does the FDR actually have some input of the physical position of the switches or is it just measuring the output signal voltage
  <br/>
  which might be changed by a momentary short from liquid or swarf.
  <br/>
  Both signals go to cutoff within 1 second but then one recovers four seconds after the other.
  <br/>
  Surely a pilot discovering a turned off switch would have both back on in less than four seconds.

  Again, you can not conclude that from the report.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Different inputs are sampled at different rates. Some very basic info here:
  <a href="https://scaledanalytics.com/2023/04/25/arinc-767-or-what-do-you-mean-my-b787-uses-767-data/" target="_blank">
   https://scaledanalytics.com/2023/04/...uses-767-data/
  </a>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's highly likely switch positions are only sampled at 1Hz, and not at 100 Hz. For engine parameters you'll likely want a higher sample rate, as the whole engine could go from perfectly fine to exploded in less than a second.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If you had something like:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  08:08:42.96 UTC: cut off switch 1
  <br/>
  08:08:43.01 UTC: cut off switch 2
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It would likely be recorded as:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  08:08:42 UTC: cut off switch 1
  <br/>
  08:08:43 UTC: cut off switch 2
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leading you to believe there was one second between these 2 actions, whereas it was actually only 50ms.

     I doubt you\x92d have got such immediate positive intervention from most line crews faced with the same circumstances and time

   </div>
  </div>
  I think most line pilots, upon noticing that the fuel levers were in cutoff right after rotation, would immediately turn them back on.  I don't think it would take 10 seconds--or even 5--to get that handled as I imagine most professional pilots would quickly grasp the seriousness of the problem.  The only explanation I can think of for even that short delay--one that may have made a big difference--is the authority gradient between Captain and FO.  But the preliminary report doesn't give us the level of detail we'd all like to have so it probably isn't possible to 100% support any specific conclusion just yet.

  It confirms that both fuel cutoff switches were moved to OFF at Vr, within a one second interval which is as extreme and inexplicable as it gets.

  Neither pilot was likely speaking in order to be recorded for posterity, so that 'conversation' makes perfect sense in a situation where there is high stress and a great deal of confusion.

  As to the report not closing off speculation, that isn't it's purpose. It is there to report the facts as they are found. It must also be said that speculation is not in any place but the eye of the beholder.

    As per the EAFR, the Engine 1 fuel cutoff switch transitioned from CUTOFF to RUN at about

   <i>
    08:08:52 UTC. The APU Inlet Door began opening at about 08:08:54 UTC, consistent with the APU Auto Start logic. Thereafter at 08:08:56 UTC the Engine 2 fuel cutoff switch also transitions from CUTOFF to RUN. When fuel control switches are moved from CUTOFF to RUN while the aircraft is inflight, each engines full authority dual engine control (FADEC) automatically manages a relight and thrust recovery sequence of ignition and fuel introduction. The EGT was observed to be rising for both engines indicating relight.
    <b>
     Engine 1's core deceleration stopped, reversed and started to progress to recovery.
    </b>
    Engine 2 was able to relight but could not arrest core speed deceleration and re-introduced fuel repeatedly to increase core speed acceleration and recovery. The EAFR recording stopped at 08:09:11 UTC.
   </i>
   <br/>
  </div>
  That was with 10 seconds delay vs. 13 seconds for engine 2.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Time was spent with the verbal exchange, and then perhaps each pilot expected the other to put the switch back?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anyway, the preliminary report also establishes that the aircraft had only 3-4 seconds of powered flight. (Would the gear lever be operated that early?) Everyone who saw that from the CCTV video, pat yourselves on the back.

  <br/>
  Mayday call, dual engine failure, RAT deployment all confirmed.
  <br/>
  TCMA was a red herring, the aircraft was firmly in air mode as the accident unfolded, and the thrust levers were at takeoff thrust the whole time.

  From the report, there is no indicated time stamp identifying the point when one pilot asked the other "why did you cut off"
  <br/>
  This could explain the the assumption that it took ten seconds to reverse the switch positions.

  Cut off could have been noticed at any point later than 08:08:42 but before 08:08:52.

     Agreed, it's most unfortunate that that the preliminary report hasn\x92t closed off speculation, it's simply created opportunity for more.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     It confirms that both fuel cutoff switches were moved to OFF at Vr, within a one second interval which is as extreme and inexplicable as it gets. Then it gives us a CVR quote that\x92s so neutered, "Why did you cut off?\x94 / \x93I didn\x92t\x94, that it raises more questions than it answers. If the goal was to reassure or clarify, it\x92s had the opposite effect.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Well, it\x92s narrowed it down to 3 possibilities:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Action slip
  <br/>
  SAIB NM-18-33
  <br/>
  Intentional.

  Read the report. There is no evidence to support your contention that the question was asked as you have quoted.

  All the supposed quote does, is tell you that the person asking the question didn't perform the action, thus presumed the other had.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There are many plausible explanations, not just the one or two you might choose to see in this scenario.

  I don't see people arguing that a pilot didn't move the switches.  I see people offering various alternative possibilities.  I do see posters, and mods, insisting that we not suggest deliberate operation of the switches with evil intent without evidence and I think that's an excellent idea.
  <br/>

  <b>
   The preliminary report does not include any specific language for the question and answer about moving the engine control switches

  Baffled, as probably all of us. But 10 seconds between \x93cut-off\x94 and \x93run\x94 is not excessive imo:

     Moving both switches to OFF within 0.1sec has to be done by two hands, unnatural body movement would be noticed by PF and questioned immediately.
