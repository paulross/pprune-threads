  the before takeoff electronic checklist senses the flap position based on FMC takeoff data input. The checklist won&rsquo;t display the &ldquo;checklist complete&rdquo; icon if the flaps aren&rsquo;t set, the takeoff configuration warning would sound as takeoff thrust is being set.

  To address a couple points raised as best able:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  &bull; B787 does have takeoff config warning, but for the flaps will only warn if a valid takeoff flap setting isn't selected - doesn't crosscheck against the FMC, and there is a range of valid settings (UP and 1 are not valid settings)
  <br/>
  &bull; Similar to Airbus there is LE Autoslat extension for low speed protection.

  &bull; That EK B777 freighter referenced may have been lightly loaded and generally speaking has far more excess thrust than a B787.

  787 driver here. The BEFORE TAKEOFF electronic checklist will not show as completed unless the flap position indication agrees with the flap setting entered into the CDU. If that is missed, a CAUTION is issued: CHKLIST INCOMPLETE NORM as the aircraft lines up on the CDU-entered runway.

  Thank you for the confirmation, this is something that is missing on the 738 and obviously therefore if the flap is in a normal take-off configuration it won\x92t warn you if it doesn\x92t agree with that entered into the FMC. Clearly not the issue here if there is such a warning system on the 787.

  Hmm. B787 pilot also and with respect, on the B787 (-9 tho) in the sim anyway, wanting an answer to this very question we experimented with setting a flap setting other than the one in the CDU and received no config warning. I believe the config warning system reads the flap position sensors, not the CDU. I am completely willing to be corrected but was quite surprised myself. 🤔

  777 guy but you\x92re talking about two different things. Unless I\x92m mistaken. You\x92re talking about the Take Off Config EICAS warning. He\x92s talking about the Before Take Off checklist showing as complete, if the selected flaps aren\x92t in agreement with the entered CDU value.

  FYI that only works when slats are already in midrange (not up)!
  <br/>
  For some back ground: the B777 has autoslats and the B787 has autogap, slightly different.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From Boeing differences handout:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  (B787) The slat autogap function is only available in primary mode when the slats are in the middle position and the airspeed is below 225 KIAS. At a high angle of attack, autogap fully extends the slats to increase the wing camber, thus increasing the lift and margin to stall. The slats return to the middle position after the angle of attack decreases. The autogap trip threshold is a function of AOA, airspeed and flap position.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When flaps are up, there is no automatic extension!
  <br/>
  On of the items of the stall recovery procedure is: DURING LIFT OFF, WHEN FLAPS ARE UP, CALL FOR FLAPS 1 (memory item!)

  Airbus does the same as 737, will only warn you if flaps are not in any takeoff position. The actual position within the takeoff range is irrelevant to the warning.

  You're correct, but I'm not talking about the config warning, which will not sound for any takeoff flap (5, 10, 15, 17, 18, 20 for the -9) set. I'm talking about the BEFORE TAKEOFF checklist. The FLAP item on that checklist is closed-loop, meaning it looks for the CDU-entered value and compares it with the sensed flap position. If they differ, the FLAP item won't go green, therefore the checklist won't be completed. If not rectified, as the aircraft lines up (i.e., before thrust lever movement to set takeoff thrust and so nothing to do with the config warning), a MASTER CAUTION and the CHKLIST INCOMPLETE NORM EICAS is generated. Having said that, it's entirely possible that that function is operator-configurable. I'll check up on that.

  Just for the record, there is no system on modern Boeing aircraft to prevent the accidental retraction of flaps when too low or slow when airborne. You wouldn't even get a warning on Boeing aircraft that is related to Flaps, you'd eventually get one related to Low Speed or Stall. The Airbus has a safety feature called "Alpha-Lock" which physically stops the Flaps from moving when the AoA or speed? is deemed too low. But that's not a safety net for all flap settings, just the lowest for takeoff. It will save the day in 95% of situations though Mr Boeing (hint hint)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Takeoff config warnings and checklists may not have helped if the flap setting was not enough given the weight and conditions. A good handling pilot could recover from an incorrect flap setting (providing there's no obstacles to deal with), by gently lowering the nose allowing the airspeed to build up before resuming the climb. However, various human factors such as startle and over reliance on automation (my thrust setting must be good) will not help the situation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In order of likelihood:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  1.) Flaps moved instead of gear
  <br/>
  2.) Incorrect Flap settings and inability of crew to recover from that
  <br/>
  3.) Double engine failure
  <br/>
  4.) Some electrical event that distracted them

  I just ran a quick performance calculation using our performance tool, albeit for a 787-9, but for the given WX conditions, the given Pax load and minimum Fuel amount for the given stretch and intersection R4. (no cargo load)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In short\x85
  <br/>
  Even though the 9 has less TO performance, it seems very unlikely they could have departed in those conditions from less than 2000m with only flaps 5, which is the minimum TO flap setting. IMHO it\x92s impossible to judge from the footage that it left with flaps up (and very unlikely) ? but it certainly wasn\x92t flaps 17 or 18.

  Item 1) On the 787, is the gear lever on the main panel facing the flight crew, or on the centre console? I'd imagine they'd (flap and gear levers) need to be adjacent to each other for that to happen. All good points though.

  <br/>
  TE Flaps are extended, flap gaps between the wing and the flap element are observable. This is not an aberration of the spoiler position, you can see the nacelles through the gap, and that means the flap can not be in the retracted position.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An error of the TE flap deployed position, say between flaps 5 or 15 is not going to cause a stall event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The flap has not been retracted instead of the gear.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Double engine failure... India. birds, always a latent threat. No rudder deflection, no aileron deflection, so it's not a SE problem, any engine issue is affecting both engines.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pitch control and roll is not compromised in the video. The crew put out a mayday, not sounding like an electrical fault or distraction.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  any funerals near by?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Incorrect TO thrust setting would not present in the video as recorded. Low thrust results in low acceleration, and extended distance to rotate. after rotate, low thrust results in low climb rate, and can result in the crew over pitching where the aircraft has obstructions that the crew have to avoid. the video appears to show the pitch increasing at a point where the aircraft is already unable to climb, not the other way round. An outside possibility.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For survivors, any from the aircraft will be a miracle, and mainly from the rear of the plane near door 3 area, if any. Plane is still striking tank traps at 70m/sec +, high ANU, it's not a high survivability event. Occupants in the buildings along the flight path will have a high fatality rate as well. This is going to be a high toll event in the aircraft and on the ground. Bad day at VAAH. RIP.

     It\x92s obviously producing plenty of thrust as it rotates from the dust. It would take longer than that for the aircraft to lose lift if the flaps were retracted instead of the gear. It take a while for them to run.

  It looks like they used up an awful lot of runway so potentially incorrect performance and thrust setting, incorrect flap setting, chuck in a temperature inversion or changing winds too if you like and mistakenly retracting flaps instead of the gear could well be the last orifice of the Emmental.

  It was mentioned before but needs mentioning again. If, as reported, a MAYDAY was issued, I think we can discount the "incorrect flap setting" and 'inadvertent flap retraction" theories. A MAYDAY call is an appropriate response to mechanical failure/bird strike etc but generally not what pops into the mind when you realise your pilot error is about to result in a crash.

  Agree 10000% this is what I feel the most likely thing is. No indication of engine failure, no indication of bird strike, no indication of Ram Air deployed (would it even have time to deploy? The plane crashed like 30 seconds after take off) The take off run was way long, low power/flaps misconfig. I think we will find the reason out very quickly.

  Ive been away from aviation a while now, but the level of information available almost immediately after drew me back in here.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Genuinely looks as though (as propellorhead has stated) it comes out of ground effect without enough lift to climb any further. I suspect high temperature, QNH and heavy load will all have played a factor, and maybe flap setting may have been insufficient on this occasion. Sad situation.

  Looking at the video of the takeoff roll, it seemed normal, normal rotation, normal initial climb. Other incidents with incorrect performance data or incorrect flap setting (especially flapless) resulted in an extended rotation phase, often with a tailstrike which doesn't seem to be the case here. So the flaps were probably set correctly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This aircraft then climbed okay but then 3 things happened
  <br/>
  <br/>
  1. They didn't raise the gear (maybe due distraction)
  <br/>
  2. They apparently called a mayday for an engine problem
  <br/>
  3. The aircraft started to sink and continued to do so until ground impact
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The videos and the flight path don't seem to show lateral deviation or rudder application but if they called mayday for an engine problem we've got to go with that.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Perhaps the flaps were retracted early but I don't see any pitch change, just sink.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As the aircraft is certified to fly on a single engine, it should have done so. That it didn't seems to indicate that the other engine also stopped developing the required thrust.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Whether it was shut down unintentionally or damaged due to some environmental factor remains to be seen but my moneys on inadvertent shutdown.
