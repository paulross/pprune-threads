     We know (from the 248-day bug) that full AC power failure is possible and we see from the RAT and landing gear orientation that full AC power failure was likely within ~10 seconds of leaving the ground.

  </div>
  I believe that particular bug is fixed, though it's always possible there's other issues causing a total AC loss.
  <br>
   <br>
    Not really relevant to what you quoted though, as the scenario in question requires:
    <ul>
     <li>
      Engines running on centre tank fuel during takeoff
      <i>
       while the aircraft is operating normally
      </i>
      <ul>
       <li>
        We don't know for certain if this is the case. It seems to be but it's not something that happens on other families.
       </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li>
      Then, total AC failure stopping fuel boost pumps.
     </li>
     <li>
      Engines suction feed from contaminated/full-of-water wing tanks.
     </li>

       I also don't see any evidence that engine driven fuel pumps alone must be able to handle this scenario: provide enough fuel flow for takeoff and climb, even while the pitch is rotating, even in a hot environment with significant weight, even while the gear is stuck down.
       <br>
        <br>
         I know that the engine driven pumps have documented limitations and that the regulations allow for some limitations. I know that at least one of these limitation is high altitude and I _suspect_ that the design intends for this unlikely scenario (engine driven fuel pumps alone with no AC pumps) to guarantee enough fuel flow to get to an airport and land. I also suspect that the APU is expected to solve loss of all AC generators - and as we know, there wasn't enough time for it to start in this scenario.
        </br>
       </br>
      </div>
     </div>
     The aircraft has two engines and should be able to climb out on one, plus it dropped like a
     <i>
      rock
     </i>
     . 'Significantly degraded' thrust isn't really compatible with what we saw. You'd also expect the engines to recover pretty quickly as it leveled off.
     <br>
      <br>
       The limitations at high altitude are primarily air/volatiles degassing out of the fuel. That's not going to be much of an issue at sea level, even if the engines are a bit higher up during rotation.
       <br/>
       APU is a nice-to-have; it's on the MEL. If you lose all four generators, it's because of some major carnage in the electrical software/hardware and chances of putting the APU on line even if it's operating are very slim.

     One of the things I've learned on this thread is that planes landing with the RAT deployed may be rare, but it does happen. The videos I've watched suggest that the engines were usually running as the plane landed, but of course the RAT can't be un-deployed in flight.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     My question is: what caused the RAT to deploy on those flights? Presumably reports have to be submitted in those cases?
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Many are maintenance or production test flights. Someone commented upthread that every Boeing widebody built gets the RAT deployed on its first flight, and I imagine some maintenance procedures require it too.

     On the 767, 757 and A330 anytime you are in single generator operations the aircraft is load shedding. The 787 with a totally different electrical system might function differently.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  The manuals suggest the 787 has even more advanced load inhibition/load shedding, shedding/recovering individual loads as required for both operational and availability reasons.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Remember the 787 uses electrics for engine start, wing anti-ice, centre hydraulics, and cabin air compressors. There's some
  <b>
   big
  </b>
  electrical loads.
  <br/>

  Centre tank boost pumps are probably comparatively small, but if you can conclusively say
  <i>

  , why power it?

     As an electronics and software engineer who has read the AD and related materials on the 248 day bug my understanding is that:
     <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
      <li>
       The specific 248-day integer overflow was patched, and before the fix was rolled out, the AD required this system to by power cycled every 120 days to prevent overflow
      </li>
      <li>
       The PCU software still has the
       <i>
        functional requirement
       </i>
       to be able to command all AC GCUs to enter failsafe mode, this means that while the initial bug was fixed, the ability for this particular software system to command the same result is still a functional part of the architecture - presumably for safety management of the AC system
      </li>
      <li>
       This was not the first or last "software overflow error" issue in Boeing or even in the 787
      </li>
     </ol>
     Although I'm not qualified in aviation engineering I do believe from an engineering safety standpoint that this architecture creates a rare but entirely feasible scenario in which the aircraft would be without AC power for at least 30 seconds until the APU could restore it.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Similar failures have happened on 737s/A320s/A330s and others. I'm not denying it's possible. There's a reason it's a certification requirement for the engines not to be dependent on aircraft power. The APU is MELable and battery starts are not extremely reliable.

    I do agree that the engine driven pumps
    <i>
     should
    </i>
    be able to provide fuel alone, the whole point of these pumps is to keep the plane flying within
    <i>
     some
    </i>
    limitations, high altitude is one of those limitations, I propose that there may be others based on the following:
    <ul>
     <li>
      Some more knowledgable people here have proposed or countered vapour lock, fuel contamination and automatic fuel cut-off theories to various degrees - even if these are not enough on their own, loss of electrical during rotation at high temperature could combine with these in a way we have not yet considered
     </li>
     <li>
      Thrust is nonlinear, and while I'm not qualified to say how much loss of fuel flow or loss of thrust would be critical in this scenario we do know that it was a hot takeoff with significant weight and gear remaining down - I know others here have run sims but I don't think anyone has focused on specific thrust / fuel flow params
     </li>
     <li>
      While electric fuel pumps might not be physically necessary for takeoff, my final point is: why are they
      <i>
       required
      </i>
      for takeoff? Is it not to mitigate cavitation, fuel sloshing at rotation, or any other kind of problem that might be relevant here?
     </li>
    </ul>
   </div>
  </div>
  Thrust is non-linear and complex. Reaction engines (i.e. fans, props) are generally most efficient at minimum power - lowest excess velocity. Turbine engines are generally most efficient at high power. These cancel out somewhere in the middle. With two engines at low power, you also don't have the drag from the dead engine or the drag from the rudder countering yaw.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cavitating destroys pumps rapidly - someone upthread said replacing the fuel pump immediately is SOP if it has suction fed. Expect end of life in tens of hours rather than tens of thousands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some aircraft have switched to using jet/venturi pumps powered by returned fuel, like the A220. The electric boost pumps there are mainly for redundancy and are shut down in cruise; only one in each wing tank. Some A320s replace the centre override pumps with venturi transfer pumps.

     Fuel control switches will cut off the fuel at any thrust or thrust lever setting - they need to be able to deal with an uncommanded thrust increase from an engine fault.
    </div>

  The fire switches potentially provide that capability.

  There are many types where the shutoff position is a fully aft thrust lever, past a lift-up gate. Apparently this has caused a few human-factors issues because other types use the exact same mechanism for setting reverse thrust.

     I&rsquo;ll hold judgement till the report is out as stranger things have happened. But what a seismic shift we have seen in the last 30 years.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     30 years ago you worried about flying with certain airlines due to their maintenance records and ages of their fleets.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     We are now in the time of choosing your airline of choice by having to research their flight routes over questionable airspace or their training schemes of their pilots.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     It is rather worrying that the majority of major airline crashes in the last 20 years have been due to the two fleshy ones riding up front, if not questionable flight planning, Military or terrorist input.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I expect thats going to be about as popular as an lead balloon here.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     In fact, I cannot remember the last major mechanical failure that led to a mass loss of life.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The Jeju one is still to be determined, but not sure if that can even be counted due to bird strikes.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I am not sure exactly where to go looking for the data, but bear in mind that total accident rates have also decreased dramatically while flight volumes have increased.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It wouldn't surprise me if solely crew-caused accidents are decreasing slightly, while mechanical/maintenance/technical failures leading to accidents have massively decreased. Crew/dispatch errors hence look far worse in comparison.

     If I recall correctly, the Mayday call was wording to the effect "thrust not achieved". That sounds like a phrase which could be expected from a pilot who had just frantically tried to restart an engine, and realized that it was not a success, and there would not be an opportunity for another attempt. The pilot aviated, (forget navigation), then communicated - over a period of 13 seconds.
    </div>

  I believe the 'thrust not achieved' was that one made up by a journalist - happy to be corrected.

    Engine 2 was able to
    <br/>
    relight but could not arrest core speed deceleration and re-introduced fuel repeatedly to
    <br/>
    increase core speed acceleration and recovery. The EAFR recording stopped at 08:09:11
    <br/>
    UTC
    <br/>
    At about 08:09:05 UTC, one of the pilots transmitted &ldquo;

  Sounds like #1 was restarting successfully but they just didn't have enough time for it to get back to high thrust.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  #2 may or may not have eventually started successfully; the extra two seconds of no fuel meant it would be a much harder start for the FADEC.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It doesn't sound like the crew have any input on the relight process; if the switch is on, the FADECs will try anything they can to get the engines lit and accelerating ASAP. Repeatedly switching between off and on will not help this process and there are basically no other controls the crew have, especially with no other power to run the engine starters.

       Why are we concentrating on the engine switches .?
       <br/>
       What happened before this to cause the engines to run down, resulting in the crew trying the documented procedure of turning the switches off then on to restart ?.

       Basically they ran out of time to resolve the problem.

    The AAIB clearly pulled the N2 data at least out of the EAFR. There is no indication that the engines were operating abnormally prior to being switched off. We also see this:

      It seems like people are jumping to conclusions about the pilots and letting Boeing off the hook without proper investigation. Instead of providing a professional, detailed transcript of the cockpit voice recorder (CVR), we&rsquo;re just getting casual comments about what the pilot allegedly said. Critical information&mdash;like the timing of transmissions, the checklist items completed before takeoff, and other key details that should be on the CVR&mdash;are essential for understanding what happened in the cockpit, especially since the crash occurred so soon after takeoff. In my view, the preliminary report feels too convenient for certain parties involved.
     </span>
    </div>

  </div>
  This is a preliminary report. It is quite detailed for a preliminary report.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Examining the before-takeoff checklists seems like it would be akin to examining the re-arrangement of the deckchairs before the titanic even hit the iceberg.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The engines were switched off. Unlike Embraer, B &amp; A have no protections stopping you switching an engine off inadvertently. From everything in the report, everything operated exactly as designed. I am not certain of how long the relight window is without windmilling speed, but +- 10 seconds seems entirely reasonable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The outstanding question that presumably requires much more in-depth investigation of the wreckage items and CVR audio is whether:
  <ul>
   <li>
    the cutoff switches were operated deliberately (and by who)
   </li>
   <li>
    the cutoff switches were operated inadvertently (and by who)
   </li>
   <li>
    the cutoff switches were bumped (by what) and the guards failed or weren't installed
   </li>
   <li>
    some electrical failure perfectly mimicked both many-pole switches being operated, then being operated again (seems unlikely)
   </li>
  </ul>

     Double pole switches. Pretty simple.You'd have to short (or open) both sets of contacts simultaneously.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     One set of poles is for the circuit power, and one set is for the switch position data.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Far more than double pole - I think it's 4-8 ish. See the number of wires in the above picture. A previous post in one of the earlier thread indicated that it was essentially one pole per function - HPSOV, LPSOV, FADEC signal, generator etc. I'm not sure which one the EAFR reads. If it was a single contact failure, you would expect to see disagreement between the various systems controlled by the switch. I think that's very unlikely given both 'failed' in the same way near simultaneously and 'recovered' when switched.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For reference, it's pretty common for industrial emergency stop buttons to have 2-3 poles: redundant poles for the actual fault switching (legislative requirement above certain hazard levels), plus an additional pole for monitoring.

     Wouldn't they already know if the detents were missing in this case? They recovered the switches and told us what position they were in at impact.

  Depends on when they identified the SB and how obvious the lack of or incorrect fitting of detents is.

     Regardless of how this happened I find it perplexing that a switch with such consequence in either position can be operated with a flick of the wrist.
     <br/>
     Firewall shutoff switches are guarded, fire bottle switches are guarded or require both hands to operate, all require two deliberate actions to operate, except two switches in the middle of the console which do so many consrquential things..
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  They have a reasonably substantial pull-out gate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Over-guarding stuff can have its own issues. People become used to operating the guard as part of normal operations, and it becomes muscle memory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apparently Embraer aircraft inhibit the shutoff switch if the thrust lever is above idle - if you have a stuck thrust lever, you need to use the fire shutoff.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another option would be to have a blocking solenoid (with override button) similar to the landing gear lever while airborne or at high speed.

     The accident aircraft was written up for a status message of &rdquo;STAB POS XDCR&rdquo; on the previous flight, which is a message relating to implausible data from the stab trim switches. It was released from maintenance (according to the preliminary report) at 06:40UTC ahead of an 07:40UTC departure (the crash flight) with &rdquo;no fault found&rdquo;.
     <br>
      <br>
       On the 787-8, as all modern planes, switches are not cabled as dry closing contacts all the way from the switch poles to the affected end devices (FADECs in the case of fuel cutoff switches), but rather connect locally to an analogue/digital converter to encode the switch position data onto the digital comms bus ARINC629 which allows all aircraft systems to talk to one another.
       <br>
        <br>
         Are the fuel cutoff switches, which are positioned adjacent to the stab trim switches, connected to the same ADC module which produced the error message on the previous flight, which maintenance was unable to resolve before the accident flight took off? I do not know, but it must be worthy of being looked into.

  I believe the fuel cutoff switches are one of the exceptions to this. They are direct wired. Stab trim may well be too.
  <br>
   <br>
    I think they're called remote data concentrators - in many cases it is a conversion from a direct digital input to a bus signal; electronics would not call it an 'analog' input unless it was actually measuring a quantitative value.

        <i>
         As per the EAFR data both engines N2 values passed below minimum idle speed, and the

        This was 5 seconds after the fuel was cut off.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        It suggests to me that the RAT deployment was initiated while the engines were still above idle and generating electrical power. Obviously one of the pilots could have done it via depressing the switch, as it's a "dual engine failure/stall" memory item (see
        <a href="https://www.pprune.org/accidents-close-calls/666581-air-india-ahmedabad-accident-12th-june-2025-part-2-a-70.html#post11918946" target="_blank">

        <br/>
        Is there a way for the RAT to deploy while the engines are still above idle?
       </div>
      </div>
     </div>
     I think I have seen a previous reference that the generators are disconnected when you select the switches to cutoff (or very shortly afterwards), not when the engine actually drops below idle. That could account for a few seconds of spool down time.

        What is unusual to me is the 4 second gap between moving Eng 1 fuel switch from cutoff to run, and moving Eng 2 fuel switch from cutoff to run.
        <br/>
        One would imagine that in this situation, speed of response would have been critical.

     That is a very good question IMHO.

     This crossed my mind too. This is called an "action-slip" by designers: a valid and frequently practised action being applied to entirely the wrong situation, resulting in an (extremely) invalid action.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     On this flight, the relative drop in noise and calm that follows the landing gear doors closing after the gear retracts during the initial climb, might have caused an action slip by PIC to perform the engine shut-down procedure used when parking on stand.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Unlikely though, I would hope.

  The gear were never retracted on this flight, so the action being caused by gear up quietness is not feasible.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Action slip in general... technically possible, but there should still be no actions being taken other than gear up (and probably still a bit early for that).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Engines off instead of gear up is one hell of an action slip.
