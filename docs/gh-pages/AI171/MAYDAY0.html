     Just for the record, there is no system on modern Boeing aircraft to prevent the accidental retraction of flaps when too low or slow when airborne. You wouldn't even get a warning on Boeing aircraft that is related to Flaps, you'd eventually get one related to Low Speed or Stall. The Airbus has a safety feature called "Alpha-Lock" which physically stops the Flaps from moving when the AoA or speed? is deemed too low. But that's not a safety net for all flap settings, just the lowest for takeoff. It will save the day in 95% of situations though Mr Boeing (hint hint)
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Takeoff config warnings and checklists may not have helped if the flap setting was not enough given the weight and conditions. A good handling pilot could recover from an incorrect flap setting (providing there's no obstacles to deal with), by gently lowering the nose allowing the airspeed to build up before resuming the climb. However, various human factors such as startle and over reliance on automation (my thrust setting must be good) will not help the situation.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     In order of likelihood:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     1.) Flaps moved instead of gear
     <br/>
     2.) Incorrect Flap settings and inability of crew to recover from that
     <br/>
     3.) Double engine failure
     <br/>
     4.) Some electrical event that distracted them
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  TE Flaps are extended, flap gaps between the wing and the flap element are observable. This is not an aberration of the spoiler position, you can see the nacelles through the gap, and that means the flap can not be in the retracted position.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An error of the TE flap deployed position, say between flaps 5 or 15 is not going to cause a stall event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The flap has not been retracted instead of the gear.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Double engine failure... India. birds, always a latent threat. No rudder deflection, no aileron deflection, so it's not a SE problem, any engine issue is affecting both engines.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pitch control and roll is not compromised in the video. The crew put out a mayday, not sounding like an electrical fault or distraction.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  any funerals near by?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Incorrect TO thrust setting would not present in the video as recorded. Low thrust results in low acceleration, and extended distance to rotate. after rotate, low thrust results in low climb rate, and can result in the crew over pitching where the aircraft has obstructions that the crew have to avoid. the video appears to show the pitch increasing at a point where the aircraft is already unable to climb, not the other way round. An outside possibility.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For survivors, any from the aircraft will be a miracle, and mainly from the rear of the plane near door 3 area, if any. Plane is still striking tank traps at 70m/sec +, high ANU, it's not a high survivability event. Occupants in the buildings along the flight path will have a high fatality rate as well. This is going to be a high toll event in the aircraft and on the ground. Bad day at VAAH. RIP.

   Captain Saurabh Bhatnagar, said: "It looks, prima facie, like a case of multiple bird hits wherein both the engines have lost power.

  "On 12th June, 2025, Air India B787 Aircraft VT-ANB, while operating flight AI-171 from Ahmedabad to Gatwick, crashed immediately after takeoff from Ahmedabad. There were 242 people on board the aircraft, consisting of 2 pilots and 10 cabin crew," said a senior DGCA official.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The aircraft was under the command of Captain Sumeet Sabharwal with First Officer Clive Kundar. Captain Sumeet Sabharwal is an LTC with 8200 hours of experience. The copilot had 1100 hours of flying experience, the official further added. The officers gave a mayday call to ATC minutes after taking off. However, they didn't respond to ATC's reply.

  A mayday call will normally contain information about the nature of the emergency.
  <br/>
  The flaps instead of gear is based on the landing gear being down throughout the whole emergency. It\x92s just weird. I get that it may be overlooked in a stressful situation, but when they had time for a mayday call?
  <br/>
  So, someone said the 747 will have an early thrust reduction if you retract flaps too early, is this also the case with the 787?

     Aerodynamically it would fit with taking off without flaps - normal rotation and climb until clear of ground effect at around 200ft at which point the lift would drop a lot. It\x92s not a single engine failure as no sign of yaw.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  hasn\x92t every jet had a take off configuration warning for about 30 years now? Surely the 787 has something far more advanced than that (electronic checklists) as well as airlines having various SOPs to catch that. Retracting flaps instead of gear is plausible (but as I said above doesn\x92t really align with the apparent mayday call they got out) but taking off with zero flaps would be unthinkable for anything as modern as a Dreamliner surely

     hasn\x92t every jet had a take off configuration warning for about 30 years now? Surely the 787 has something far more advanced than that (electronic checklists) as well as airlines having various SOPs to catch that. Retracting flaps instead of gear is plausible (but as I said above doesn\x92t really align with the apparent mayday call they got out) but taking off with zero flaps would be unthinkable for anything as modern as a Dreamliner surely

   </div>

  Mayday call could just be a panicked reaction to not having a clue what was happening.

  Looking at the new video and seeing the time airborne I doubt there was time for a mayday call, unless maybe the Captain became incapacitated, has the mayday call been verified?

  What are the electrical systems like on the 787? I only ask as there is a very early post where a guy flew the aircraft on the way in and at least in the passenger cabin, it was electrical gremlins galore.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  most of the aircraft IFE screens unpowered, call bells not working, no AC, nothing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  What if they were already flying with one of the systems in-op? Aircraft hot on the ground (air temp was 42c) if i recall)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  how does the wiring of a 787 and its electrical sources work and is there any potential for it to interfere with A/T if there was an electrical failure, adding in the fact that the 787 is running on lithium packs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The only thing that would rule out complete electrical failure would be the mayday call - but for those knowledgeable, is there any electrical event that could cause this?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  at the risk of sounding daft, its almost as though everything just went off, at 200ft.

  Please all... let's get more facts and data before unwarranted speculation about cause or culpability.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That's especially pertinent about questionable aspects like flap extensions used for takeoff, temperature effects, limited runway distance, and other likely irrelevant circumstances.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The "bang", Mayday call, potential RAT deployment, and high alpha touchdown may prove significant, ....if and only if they are later verified by accident investigation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is most inappropriate to yet for any professional aviators be inferring any flight crew, airline, or OEM connections whatsoever. Only sympathy and aid for the crew, passengers, families, airline, and those impacted by this tragic crash, and support to the accident investigators, ....should be in our thoughts and prayers at this point.

  Looking at the video of the takeoff roll, it seemed normal, normal rotation, normal initial climb. Other incidents with incorrect performance data or incorrect flap setting (especially flapless) resulted in an extended rotation phase, often with a tailstrike which doesn't seem to be the case here. So the flaps were probably set correctly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This aircraft then climbed okay but then 3 things happened
  <br/>
  <br/>
  1. They didn't raise the gear (maybe due distraction)
  <br/>
  2. They apparently called a mayday for an engine problem
  <br/>
  3. The aircraft started to sink and continued to do so until ground impact
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The videos and the flight path don't seem to show lateral deviation or rudder application but if they called mayday for an engine problem we've got to go with that.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Perhaps the flaps were retracted early but I don't see any pitch change, just sink.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As the aircraft is certified to fly on a single engine, it should have done so. That it didn't seems to indicate that the other engine also stopped developing the required thrust.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Whether it was shut down unintentionally or damaged due to some environmental factor remains to be seen but my moneys on inadvertent shutdown.

  I think it may be a simple case of inaccurate takeoff performance data, or inadvertent retraction of flaps instead of gear (this can happen and does happen).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I'm no expert and open to discussion, but it looks to me like the slats are somewhat extended but the flaps weren't, or at least not from the angles we have seen so far. The autogap system on the B787 will automatically extend the slats if they are already in the middle position (i.e Flaps 1) with KIAS &lt;225. Perhaps, either the inaccurate input for takeoff performance produced figures that allowed a Flaps 1 departure, leading to a longer takeoff roll and then once out of ground effect, insufficient climb gradient and a pilot induced stall. Alternatively, at the point where you would likely ask for gear up, the PM has inadvertently selected Flaps 1 from Flaps 5 leading to the same effect. Pilots experienced startle and shock, declared a Mayday as they knew they were descending when they shouldn't be and didn't have time to appropriately react.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dual engine failure is obviously a possibilty however rare it might be. but it doesn't look like any catastrophic failure from the video. Clearly a sad day for all in aviation and looking forward to the official investigation and results, hopefully something we can all learn from.

  nothing was normal the plane rotated right at the end of the runway far too late and barely climbed at all for 10 seconds before falling 20 seconds and finally crashing 30 seconds after take off.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The most obvious answer is low power/flaps setting if the engines were weird they would have probably aborted take off. Bird strike/engine issue during take off roll after v1? Super unlikely but never say never
