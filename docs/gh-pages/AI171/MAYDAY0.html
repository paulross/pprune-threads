  How horrible. From what has surfaced so far, it does appear that the aircraft became airborne and got to a reasonable height and groundspeed, within parameters for a normal takeoff. The video with RAT-like audio and the snapshot from another video showing hints of RAT deployment seem to be the biggest clues so far: flaps and gear are a minor issue compared with a serious power loss, although loss of electrical power would trigger the RAT if it uses the same logic on the 787 as earlier Boeings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That you can hear the RAT on the video over what should be engines at takeoff thrust at that point adds credence to the theory, as does reports of a MAYDAY.

  The audio is not great and kind of whiny.  Even at the end when the crash happens, it does not sound robust.
  <br>
   <br>
    Likely: this is not the RAT sound; it is just poor audio pickup.

     Just for the record, there is no system on modern Boeing aircraft to prevent the accidental retraction of flaps when too low or slow when airborne. You wouldn't even get a warning on Boeing aircraft that is related to Flaps, you'd eventually get one related to Low Speed or Stall. The Airbus has a safety feature called "Alpha-Lock" which physically stops the Flaps from moving when the AoA or speed? is deemed too low. But that's not a safety net for all flap settings, just the lowest for takeoff. It will save the day in 95% of situations though Mr Boeing (hint hint)
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Takeoff config warnings and checklists may not have helped if the flap setting was not enough given the weight and conditions. A good handling pilot could recover from an incorrect flap setting (providing there's no obstacles to deal with), by gently lowering the nose allowing the airspeed to build up before resuming the climb. However, various human factors such as startle and over reliance on automation (my thrust setting must be good) will not help the situation.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     In order of likelihood:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     1.) Flaps moved instead of gear
     <br/>
     2.) Incorrect Flap settings and inability of crew to recover from that
     <br/>
     3.) Double engine failure
     <br/>
     4.) Some electrical event that distracted them
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  TE Flaps are extended, flap gaps between the wing and the flap element are observable. This is not an aberration of the spoiler position, you can see the nacelles through the gap, and that means the flap can not be in the retracted position.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An error of the TE flap deployed position, say between flaps 5 or 15 is not going to cause a stall event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The flap has not been retracted instead of the gear.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Double engine failure... India. birds, always a latent threat. No rudder deflection, no aileron deflection, so it's not a SE problem, any engine issue is affecting both engines.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pitch control and roll is not compromised in the video. The crew put out a mayday, not sounding like an electrical fault or distraction.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  any funerals near by?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Incorrect TO thrust setting would not present in the video as recorded. Low thrust results in low acceleration, and extended distance to rotate. after rotate, low thrust results in low climb rate, and can result in the crew over pitching where the aircraft has obstructions that the crew have to avoid. the video appears to show the pitch increasing at a point where the aircraft is already unable to climb, not the other way round. An outside possibility.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For survivors, any from the aircraft will be a miracle, and mainly from the rear of the plane near door 3 area, if any. Plane is still striking tank traps at 70m/sec +, high ANU, it's not a high survivability event. Occupants in the buildings along the flight path will have a high fatality rate as well. This is going to be a high toll event in the aircraft and on the ground. Bad day at VAAH. RIP.

   Captain Saurabh Bhatnagar, said: "It looks, prima facie, like a case of multiple bird hits wherein both the engines have lost power. The take-off was perfect and just, I believe, short of taking the gear up, the aircraft started descending, which can happen only in case the engine loses power or the aircraft stops developing lift. Obviously, the investigation will reveal the exact reason."

  "On 12th June, 2025, Air India B787 Aircraft VT-ANB, while operating flight AI-171 from Ahmedabad to Gatwick, crashed immediately after takeoff from Ahmedabad. There were 242 people on board the aircraft, consisting of 2 pilots and 10 cabin crew," said a senior DGCA official.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The aircraft was under the command of Captain Sumeet Sabharwal with First Officer Clive Kundar. Captain Sumeet Sabharwal is an LTC with 8200 hours of experience. The copilot had 1100 hours of flying experience, the official further added. The officers gave a mayday call to ATC minutes after taking off. However, they didn't respond to ATC's reply.

  A mayday call will normally contain information about the nature of the emergency.
  <br/>
  The flaps instead of gear is based on the landing gear being down throughout the whole emergency. It\x92s just weird. I get that it may be overlooked in a stressful situation, but when they had time for a mayday call?
  <br/>
  So, someone said the 747 will have an early thrust reduction if you retract flaps too early, is this also the case with the 787?

  It was mentioned before but needs mentioning again. If, as reported, a MAYDAY was issued, I think we can discount the "incorrect flap setting" and 'inadvertent flap retraction" theories. A MAYDAY call is an appropriate response to mechanical failure/bird strike etc but generally not what pops into the mind when you realise your pilot error is about to result in a crash.

     Aerodynamically it would fit with taking off without flaps - normal rotation and climb until clear of ground effect at around 200ft at which point the lift would drop a lot. It\x92s not a single engine failure as no sign of yaw.

  hasn\x92t every jet had a take off configuration warning for about 30 years now? Surely the 787 has something far more advanced than that (electronic checklists) as well as airlines having various SOPs to catch that. Retracting flaps instead of gear is plausible (but as I said above doesn\x92t really align with the apparent mayday call they got out) but taking off with zero flaps would be unthinkable for anything as modern as a Dreamliner surely

  Mayday call could just be a panicked reaction to not having a clue what was happening.

  Looking at the new video and seeing the time airborne I doubt there was time for a mayday call, unless maybe the Captain became incapacitated, has the mayday call been verified?

  What are the electrical systems like on the 787? I only ask as there is a very early post where a guy flew the aircraft on the way in and at least in the passenger cabin, it was electrical gremlins galore.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  most of the aircraft IFE screens unpowered, call bells not working, no AC, nothing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  What if they were already flying with one of the systems in-op? Aircraft hot on the ground (air temp was 42c) if i recall)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  how does the wiring of a 787 and its electrical sources work and is there any potential for it to interfere with A/T if there was an electrical failure, adding in the fact that the 787 is running on lithium packs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The only thing that would rule out complete electrical failure would be the mayday call - but for those knowledgeable, is there any electrical event that could cause this?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  at the risk of sounding daft, its almost as though everything just went off, at 200ft.

  Please all... let's get more facts and data before unwarranted speculation about cause or culpability.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That's especially pertinent about questionable aspects like flap extensions used for takeoff, temperature effects, limited runway distance, and other likely irrelevant circumstances.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The "bang", Mayday call, potential RAT deployment, and high alpha touchdown may prove significant, ....if and only if they are later verified by accident investigation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is most inappropriate to yet for any professional aviators be inferring any flight crew, airline, or OEM connections whatsoever. Only sympathy and aid for the crew, passengers, families, airline, and those impacted by this tragic crash, and support to the accident investigators, ....should be in our thoughts and prayers at this point.
