  I perfectly understand that there is much talking about TCMA here.
  <br/>
  There is no direct evidence of what caused the crash but several indirect evidences point towards a near simultaneous shutdown of both engines without any visual clue of a catastrophic mechanical mishap. This leads to suspecting near simultaneous fuel starvation of both engines.
  <br/>
  As the purpose of TCMA is shutting down the High Pressure Shut-Off Valve (HPSOV) and thus the fuel feed of an engine, it's normal to collect information on TCMA, on how it works, and on what data feeds it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, I hardly understand why there is no similar discussion about the spar valves and the systems that control their opening and closure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I understand that the B787 spar valves are located in the MLG well, or at least are maintained from within that well.
  <br/>
  If the engine shutdown happened when the gear retraction was commanded, that's a location commonality (although it's very unlikely that a mechanical problem happened in both wells at the same time).
  <br/>
  Also I understand that there are several systems that command the opening or closing of the spar valves:
  <br/>
  - opening: "Engine control panel switch" set to "START", or "Fuel control switch" set to "RUN"
  <br/>
  - closing: "Engine fire handle" pulled out. (I wonder if "Fuel control switch" set to "CUTOFF" also closes the spar valve).
  <br/>
  Are there direct wires running from these controls to the valves or is there a pair of control units receiving these signals and controlling the valve actuators?
  <br/>
  If the latter is true, where are these control units? I guess that the likely location is the aft EE bay. Are they beside each other?

     The excellent #724 post by user989 really should be seen as the defining statement on what is currently known.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I\x92d like to add a complimentary test to user989\x92s logic on TCMA faults.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Regardless of whether the \x91aircraft on ground\x92 signal was incorrect after rotation it would have been correct during the takeoff roll. IF there was an unrevealed fault in a thrust lever position signal THEN why didn\x92t TCMA activate during taxiing or the takeoff roll?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Such a fault occurring spontaneously in just the few seconds after rotation is way way down the probability table. Such a fault occurring spontaneously on both separate (think ETOPS) engine control systems is surely vanishingly unlikely.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     They may be out there but you\x92d have to ask if TCMA is implicated where are the lower consequence precursor events in the 787 fleet? These might be spurious TCMA action on one engine or faults with \x91aircraft on ground\x92 found during maintenance or engines not responding to thrust lever position and so on.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Change Analysis would ask what happened differently in the few seconds after rotation on this flight that separates it from all other 787 takeoffs and why at that particular time ?The interim report will provide some answers until then please let\x92s confine this thread to fact based technical discussion and debate.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Re-reading this I did briefly consider suggesting engine overshoot of thrust lever positions and FADEC shut down on N1 overspeed but that leaves a lot of WHY and WHY both engines questions so I dismissed it.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  You mention here the a/c roll and after rotation but there is also a short period during take-off where the wheels are in the process of leaving the runway. There is also the situation where the MLG was suspended at an angle. What was the WoW value at this stage?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also during this period, the Rad Alt may not have been giving useful values given its proximity to the ground
  <br/>
  <br/>
  These two factors alone could increase the possibility of an error quite considerably.....

     The gear tilt position is not definitive evidence crew had selected gear up. I've speculated another cause for this non-normal gear tilt is that C hydraulics failed around time of rotation. This would explain the gear remaining in the forward tilt position. There are reasons why the crew may have not selected gear up,

      see earlier post.
     </a>
     Therefore we cannot determine wow or air/ground logic from an assumed gear retraction.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Further to the (logical in my view) points you make in response to AAKEE's ostensibly logical conclusion that the commencement of undercarriage retraction (if it did commence) is conclusive of the aircraft being 'in the air' for aircraft systems purposes, including TCMA purposes, I make the following points:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  First, whilst it may be that every system that monitors and makes decisions about whether the aircraft is 'in the air' does so on the basis of exactly the same sensor inputs, that may not be true and I'd appreciate someone with the expert knowledge on the 78 to confirm or refute the correctness of the assumption, particularly in relation to, for example, FADEC functions compared with undercarriage control functions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Secondly and probably more importantly, what happens if one of the sensors being used to determine 'in air' versus 'on ground' gives an erroneous 'on ground' signal
  <i>
   after
  </i>
  - maybe just seconds after - every one of those sensors has given the 'in air' signal?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Reference was made earlier in this thread to a 'latched' in air FADEC condition that resulted in engine shut downs after the aircraft involved landed and was therefore actually on the ground. But what if some sensor failure had resulted in the aircraft systems believing that the aircraft was now on the ground when it was not? I also note that after the 2009 B737-800 incident at Schiphol &ndash; actually 1.5 kms away, where the aircraft crashed in a field during approach - the investigation ascertained that a RADALT system suddenly sent an erroneous minus 8&rsquo; height reading to the automatic throttle control system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The conceptual description of the TCMA says that the channels monitor the &ldquo;position of thrust lever&rdquo; &ndash; no surprises there &ndash; &ldquo;engine power level&rdquo; &ndash; no surprises there &ndash; and &ldquo;several other digital inputs via digital ARINC data buses&rdquo;.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  WoW should of course be one of those "digital inputs" and be a 1 or 0. But I haven't seen any authoritative post about whether the change in state on the 78 requires only one sensor to signal WoW or if, as is more likely, there are (at least) two sensors &ndash; one on each MLG leg &ndash; both of which have to be &lsquo;weight off&rsquo; before a weight off wheels state signal is sent. Maybe a sensor on each leg sends inputs to the ARINC data and the systems reading the data decide what to do about the different WoW signals, as between 00, 01, 10 and 11.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There is authoritative information to the effect that RADALT is also one of the &ldquo;digital inputs&rdquo; to the TCMA. The RADALTs presumably output height data (that is of course variable with height) and I don&rsquo;t know whether the RADALT hardware involved has a separate 1 or 0 output that says that, so far as the RADALT is concerned, the aircraft to which it is strapped is, in fact, &lsquo;in the air&rsquo; at &lsquo;some&rsquo; height, with the actual height being so high as to be irrelevant to the systems using that input (if that input is in fact generated and there are, in fact, systems that use that 1 or 0).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If we now consider the &lsquo;worst case scenario will be preferred&rsquo; concept that apparently applies to the TCMA design so as to achieve redundancy, the number of sensor inputs it&rsquo;s monitoring to decide whether, and can change its decision whether, the aircraft is on the ground, becomes a very important matter. The TCMA is only supposed to save the day on the ground, if the pilots select idle thrust on a rejected take off but one or both of the engines fail to respond. In the &lsquo;worst case&rsquo; (in my view) scenario, both TCMA channels on both engines will be monitoring/affected by
  <i>
   every
  </i>
  WoW sensor output and
  <i>
   every
  </i>
  RADALT output data and, if
  <i>
   any one of them
  </i>
  says &lsquo;on ground&rsquo;, that will result in
  <i>
   both
  </i>
  engines&rsquo; TCMAs being enabled to command fuel shut off, even though the aircraft may, in fact, be in the air.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Of course it&rsquo;s true that the TCMA&rsquo;s being enabled is not, of itself, sufficient to cause fuel cut off to an engine. That depends on a further glitch or failure in the system or software monitoring engine power and thrust lever position, or an actual &lsquo;too much thrust compared to thrust lever position&rsquo; situation. But I can&rsquo;t see why, on balance, it&rsquo;s prudent to increase the albeit extraordinarily remote risk of an &lsquo;in air&rsquo; TCMA commanded engine or double engine shut down due to multiple sensor failure &ndash; just one in-air / on-ground sensor and one of either the thrust lever sensor/s or engine power sensor/s &ndash; or, in the case of an actual in air &lsquo;too much thrust compared to thrust lever position situation&rsquo;, why that &lsquo;problem&rsquo; could not be handled by the crew shutting down the engine when the crew decides it&rsquo;s necessary. Once in the air, too much thrust than desired is a much better problem to have than no thrust. The latter is precisely what would happen if all &lsquo;on ground / in air&rsquo; sensors were functioning properly and some &lsquo;too much thrust&rsquo; condition occurred.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hopefully the design processes, and particularly the DO-178B/C software design processes done by people with much bigger brains than mine, have built in enough sanity checking and error checking into the system, followed by exhaustive testing, so as to render my thoughts on the subject academic.
