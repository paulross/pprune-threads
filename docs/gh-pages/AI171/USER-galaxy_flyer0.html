     I am curious how this can happen? The handle for the gear is on a completely different place in the cockpit that the flaps handle.
     <br/>
     Possibly a B787 pilot could give us an idea?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     What is nearby the flaps handle are the switches for the "fuel control".

     The RAT sounds to be deployed in some videos. Does the RAT deploy automatically on the B787?
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  EVERY RAT automatically deploys under the right conditions usually loss of all electrics or all engines.  The C-5\x92s RAT dropped when 3 generators \x93in a row\x94 (1,2,3 or 2,3,4).  I can\x92t remember the Global but I thinks its loss of both AC generators.

     Right, that's because it's not not meant to be used during normal flight operations. Generally, usage of the RAT indicates #### has hit the fan(blades).
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     To corroborate this, one can note that the RAT cannot be stowed once it's deployed under these conditions. That's because the RAT is ultimately either deployed because it's "forced" out by an active signal, OR it's deployed because the electromagnetic system is de-energized and the spring loaded mount flaps it out. That's what happens when nothing is stopping the spring from doing spring action things, like you'd see when there's no power going to whatever usually holds it shut.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Oddly, we could retract the C-5 RAT in flight, regardless of how it was deployed. It was checked in our RAT checks. 180 KIAS, maximum.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the ground, the switch was in RET, then placed in AUTO on the taxi-out.  About once a year and new pilot in the left seat would drop by going thru AITO to DEPLOY.  Oops, &ldquo;just go up to  RET, then AUTO, this time.

     Sorry but before you make a statement like this, you better read up on the "complexity and sophistication" of the latest business jets like the Gulfstreams and Global Express.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The Global Express has 4 engine driven generators, one APU generator, one RAT generator that provide AC and DC power to the aircraft's systems. On the hydraulic side, the aircraft has 3 fully independent and redundant hydraulic systems which power all flight control surfaces the exception being, the slats and flaps are AC power driven and are available even with only the RAT providing power. The 3 hydraulic systems are powered from each engine backed up by 2 EDPs (system 1 and 2) and system 3 is powered by 2 EDPs only. The RAT powers system 3 via one of its EDPs. In the event of a dual engine failure the RAT would deploy automatically and power the AC essential plus DC essential busses and one EDP on system 3. The APU is available to you up to FL450 and will supply full AC power but bleed air only up to FL300.

  Welll, he was referring to a Gulfstream&hellip;. BDL Flt Ops

  Elsewhere, there is a picture of the tail wreckage showing what looks likethe APU door partially open. The panel is otherwise undamaged indicating not caused by post-impact. I&rsquo;ll try to poach it

  I will add loss of all generators and all engines failed can look at first and second glance awfully similar and confusing.  At least from the times I&rsquo;ve seen it in the sim in several types.

     777/787 driver here.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Reading a few posts about an APU-to-pack takeoff, or a packs off takeoff on a 787, because of the hot weather, makes me shake my head.
     <br/>
     There is no bleed air on the 787. A packs off takeoff, or an apu to pack takeoff, is never done. There isn\x92t a procedure in the fcom to describe it. It is also pointless. The packs are electrical.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Then the gear.
     <br/>
     When you lift off the runway, the gear doors open REGARDLESS of gear lever position. If you do not raise the gear within 30 seconds, the gear doors close again and you keep the gear down as you apparently desire. In the video, the gear doors are closed again as the airplane flies into the suburb. This requires normal hydraulics in system C, which was apprently available as the doors are closed again.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     takeoff performance:
     <br/>
     I entered all relevant weather parameters into my performance tool for Ahmedabad VAAH, rwy 23, 42 degrees C and no wind, qnh 1005.
     <br/>
     It comes up with flaps 10 as optimum, albeit for a 787-9 (don\x92t have the possibility to calculate for the 787-8) But even the 787-9 is able to depart with flaps 5 in those conditions. Max tow around 230tons.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Isn\x92t the gear door feature exclusive to the -9 and -10 variants, not on the -8?

     Maybe a dumb question - A DA-42 went in with double engine failure when the gear was retracted, the additional load of the gear pump was enough to drop the bus voltages low enough to shut down both FADECs. They took off with a very low battery and no one had tested this scenario previously. Obviously a very different airplane, but still raising the gear probably is a significant load and may have caused an electrical problem to get worse.
     <br/>
     * or Boeing thought of that, DA-42s got rewired and won't do that now.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  The FADECs are completely independent of the plane\x92s electrics IN THE EVENT of the aircraft electrical.  There\x92s a Permanent Magnet Alternator to power it.

     I was referring to CVR/FDRs in general being specialist equipment requiring specialist facilities to process. In any case, I would be very interested to find out where those from this accident are read. It appears from a post upthread there are new facilities in New Dehli that could be used. Having said that, for the EK 521 accident in Dubai the recorders were sent to the UK for analysis, despite a "flight data recorder centre" in Abu Dhabi being opened (again with much fanfare) by the UAE GCAA five years before the occurrence.

     I wonder if those reported eight Air Indian 787-8's pulled in for 'looking at', have had any issues with failed power systems, as in the reported and video of this aircraft, having no IFE systems working.,
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Wasn't there a post by someone who claimed to have been a (ex) crew member of the aircraft who said that there have been a number a complaints about power issues in that aircraft and it was brough to management's attention, but nothing was apparently taken seriously...?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     If it is an AI maintenance issue and considering that the Black Box has been looked at for days now.
     <br/>
     <acronym title="As far as I know">
      AFAIK
     </acronym>
     , there's two black boxes, each with identical data, so only one is needed (theoretically), Plus,
     <acronym title="As far as I know">
      AFAIK
     </acronym>
     , the data can be retrieved remotely on these newer boxes.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     And as mentioned, if it was a 'software' bug relating to engine cutoff's or other inherent engine issues, then the whole fleet would be grounded - HOWEVER - as in the 737 MCAS debacle, it was known for a long time before the crashes that 'something was wrong' with the pitch control - as was being reported on NASA's own NSRS database even IIRC years before.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     And again (I made a post somewhere months ago), why on earth doesn't any airport that is say classed as international, have 4k cameras installed.
     <br/>
     Look at how many pages have been "were the flaps out on takeoff", and such like, "Ran out of runway" - even (maybe), Engine thrust could be seen, bogey conditions, tire conditions,
     <br/>
     Could answer a lot of information as to "Was the aircraft in good configuration on Takeoff/Landing',
     <br/>
     The world has watched hours upon hours of potato cam footage of AI-171 taking off - plus a handheld phone footage taken by a kid, and that's the best a trillion $$ airline industry can do..?
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Why?  Because it\x92s a low value added installation.  Cameras might satisfy the public and spotters desire for instantaneous news, but it wouldn\x92t appreciably add to safety.  VAAH has been in operation for 88 years, its last fatal hull loss was almost 40 years ago, landing in fog where a camera would record nothing.  There are better safety improvements to spend the money on.

     That's an interesting possibility. The independent power supply for the forward recorder also powers the cockpit area microphone, but not the individual crew mikes, so working out who said what could well be dependent on being able to recognise the voices.

     The gag rule is pretty much the first thing you're told when you get drawn into an investigation - and you can get in big trouble for violating it (even if inadvertent).
     <br/>
     A Boeing management type got his hand slapped pretty hard not to long ago when he made the mistake of answering a reporter's question regarding the Alaska door plug blowout.
     <br/>
     I was tempted to contact my friend who was my counterpart during the 787/GEnx-1B development, but I suspect he's already been contacted and is considered to be part of the investigation - so he couldn't talk to me about it anyway.

     I wonder if the delay in announcing any preliminary findings is because of the enormity of the consequences.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Let us say the investigation team have discovered a unique technical fault that caused the accident, but don\x92t yet know why it happened, how would the team proceed? On the one hand they\x92ve uncovered a fault which could reoccur and cause another accident (but a fault that has only happened once in 14 years). On the other hand a grounding would have enormous commercial consequences worldwide, with the possibility that an inspection and/or rectification are not yet available.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     What would they do?
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Normally, the preliminary report is released about 30 days, post- event.  It isn\x92t late, they\x92re not dragging their heels.  Slow down, the process takes time.

     My point was IF the investigations team have already discovered that a technical issue caused the accident, and it could happen again, how would they balance the need to inform everyone quickly, against the commercial consequences of a grounding, especially if the reason for the fault wasn\x92t yet understood.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  The IIC would bring together the investigators, which include the FAA rep, OEM reps, and try to reach a consensus on the what and is there a technical fix or advisory needed.  It could be notice to operators, an emergency AD.  This process is not played out in the media.  We don\x92t need to know until the IIC releases the information.

  In the history of jet transport aviation, both ETOPS and non-ETOPS operations, exactly how many simultaneous dual engine failures have there been, excluding pilot causal ones?  I&rsquo;d venture it&rsquo;s zero.  Even the old DC-9/Boeing 727 era had none.  ETOPS is 40 years on and zero cases, to my knowledge.  Modern twins are systematically divided into two separate and independent planes.  My bet is all these neat theories based on arcane questions will boil down to some human causal event, excluding Boeing.  They might contributory, as in the Delta 767 where the switch design contributed to pilot misaction, but design fault, vanishingly improbable.

  No, it wasn\x92t, I\x92d forgotten it.  Hardly, on departure, however.  But it proves my contention it\x92s a very small compared to the number of pilot-induced errors causing loss of all engines.  The statistics certainly indicate most crashes are human related in the operation and maintenance areas.
