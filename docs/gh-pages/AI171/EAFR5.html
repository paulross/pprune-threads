     Such a fault in a multi pole switch would be odd. And in two switches at roughly the same time?
     <br/>
     Typically you'd have a fault in one set of poles, giving you conflicting data.
     <br/>
     Such as the EAFR registers a fuel switch in cutoff, but the fuel did not actually cut off.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Don't forget that the RAT deployed instantly, shortly after liftoff, agreeing that both switches were in CUTOFF.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Yes - conflicting data issuing a warning when the system being controlled has no fault. That's a problem at considerable expense for a rare occurrence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Literally covering all the bases with a video would not only show what the switch status was but also how it got there, if it has an immediate effect, which a second line would not do.

     If there was some kind of Stabiliser error message during the timeline of this accident it would certainly be mentioned in the preliminary report. I am sure that the investigators would have noted it and arrived to similar conclusion you did. A Stabiliser error message would be too relevant piece of information to ignore it in the report.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Thanks for your comment. Agreed, but why did the report make mention of the Stabiliser fault on the previous sector? If this is completely irrelevant, why was it mentioned at all? There a quite a few specifics that are missing from this initial report, such as specific CVR information (what was actually said by the pilots). The report also says "...The EAFR data downloaded from forward EAFR is being analyzed in detail..." This indicates that more is known than is in the report. I suspect that the initial report was put out to meet the "30 day rule" and there will be further interim reports before the final.

  Really? It suggests to me and I would imagine the vast majority of us who have flown modern Boeings that they were physically moved, by one of the crew, one at a time, the question is why.

     (Admin/Mod)Folks, it appears that the message isn't getting through.
     <br/>
     There were two professional pilots on that flight deck.
     <br/>
     It is not acceptable to effectively accuse
     <u>
      <b>
       both
      </b>
     </u>
     of a criminal act, because there is no evidence to identify which hand -
     <u>
      <b>
       if either
      </b>
     </u>
     - moved the fuel switches, or for what purpose or reason.
     <br/>
     Unless and until any such evidence is published by the relevant authorities, kindly desist from doing so out of respect for your professional colleagues.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  The Mods have stuck to this principle, which I shall try to adhere to.
  <br/>
  This preliminary report is just that, but maybe consider the issues the Indian AAIB have had to address in publishing it. They will have a similar concern to the pP mods, maybe more so since any apparent accusations directed at the pilots may lead to physical retribution.
  <br/>
  I therefore conclude great care has been taken to "sanitise" what the AAIB know, or at least strongly suspect, (from EAFR) into the report. They have conspicuously failed to identify which of the pilots was each half of the conversation they have not repeated the exact words, there's a lot missing (was positive rate ever called, was rotate ever called, any discussion about putting FC back to Run, who/how flying aircraft meanwhile). As a result we, the reader, should step back and not over-interpret this sanitised report.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Secondly, given the mod statement above,
  <b>
   <u>
    if
   </u>
  </b>
  a criminal act is suspected by the AAIB, this will likely trigger all sorts of 'primacy' issues in the investigation i.e. police? AAIB? or joint? and all the history that involves (SAS Linate?) - in Europe we have 996-2010 Article 12 para 2, but India?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <b>
   Summary
  </b>
  : For good reason I believe this report has been very carefully worded, sanitised with great care, and as such easy to inappropriately speculate what went on.

     The accident aircraft was written up for a status message of &rdquo;STAB POS XDCR&rdquo; on the previous flight, which is a message relating to implausible data from the stab trim switches. It was released from maintenance (according to the preliminary report) at 06:40UTC ahead of an 07:40UTC departure (the crash flight) with &rdquo;no fault found&rdquo;.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     On the 787-8, as all modern planes, switches are not cabled as dry closing contacts all the way from the switch poles to the affected end devices (FADECs in the case of fuel cutoff switches), but rather connect locally to an analogue/digital converter to encode the switch position data onto the digital comms bus ARINC629 which allows all aircraft systems to talk to one another.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Are the fuel cutoff switches, which are positioned adjacent to the stab trim switches, connected to the same ADC module which produced the error message on the previous flight, which maintenance was unable to resolve before the accident flight took off? I do not know, but it must be worthy of being looked into.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I believe the fuel cutoff switches are one of the exceptions to this. They are direct wired. Stab trim may well be too.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I think they're called remote data concentrators - in many cases it is a conversion from a direct digital input to a bus signal; electronics would not call it an 'analog' input unless it was actually measuring a quantitative value.

  I think I have seen a previous reference that the generators are disconnected when you select the switches to cutoff (or very shortly afterwards), not when the engine actually drops below idle. That could account for a few seconds of spool down time.

     What is unusual to me is the 4 second gap between moving Eng 1 fuel switch from cutoff to run, and moving Eng 2 fuel switch from cutoff to run.

      Was the RAT deployed manually?

     <br/>
     The report says,
     <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
      <i>
       As per the EAFR data both engines N2 values passed below minimum idle speed, and the

       RAT hydraulic pump began supplying hydraulic power at about 08:08:47 UTC.
      </i>
     </div>
     This was 5 seconds after the fuel was cut off.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     It suggests to me that the RAT deployment was initiated while the engines were still above idle and generating electrical power. Obviously one of the pilots could have done it via depressing the switch, as it's a "dual engine failure/stall" memory item (see
     <a href="https://www.pprune.org/accidents-close-calls/666581-air-india-ahmedabad-accident-12th-june-2025-part-2-a-70.html#post11918946" target="_blank">

     ) that won't hurt anything.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Is there a way for the RAT to deploy while the engines are still above idle?
    </div>
   </div>

  Loss of hydraulics or electrics will auto deploy the rat. The timing to me however seems to match up with when the engines were selected off.

  If the thrust levers were found in idle but, according to the EAFR, were set to TO thrust until the end, doesn\x92t that also raise further questions? I mean: Of course, the impact causes compression at the nose, but the centrifugal forces act in the opposite direction. So, if there is an objective inconsistency here, and we have a pilot who says he did not operate the fuel cut-off switches, while the EAFR indicates otherwise, then we have yet another inconsistency.
