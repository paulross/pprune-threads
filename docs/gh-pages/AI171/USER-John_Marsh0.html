  I think Mr Ramesh is potentially a valuable source of information, as well as incredibly fortunate.  I hope that he will be invited to give his full recollection, starting from when he boarded the aircraft.  He may have observed other issues with lighting or heard unusual sounds, for example.  Ideally, he would do this soon after being discharged from hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I do not think Mr Ramesh's status as a passenger necessarily disqualifies him as a witness.  I would agree that the accounts of cabin or flight crew from AI 171 would be more authoritative; sadly none is available.

    Twenty-two out of the total 34 Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft in the Indian fleet have been inspected, and &ldquo;nothing alarming&rdquo; has been found during the surveillance, officials familiar with the matter said on Sunday.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    &ldquo;Checks on 22 787s have been completed and nothing alarming was found during the surveillance&rdquo; one of the officials said, adding that &ldquo;the inspection on the remaining B787 may be completed by Monday&rdquo;.

    The airline, on Saturday, said that it was in the process of completing the one-time safety checks directed by the Indian aviation regulator DGCA. &ldquo;These checks are being carried out on the Boeing 787 fleet as they return to India, before being cleared for their next operations&rdquo; it had said.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    These checks include inspection of fuel parameter monitoring and associated system checks, inspection of Cabin air compressor and associated systems, electronic engine control-system test, engine fuel driven actuator-operational test and oil system check, serviceability check of Hydraulic system and review of take-off parameters

  I have been able to access the video.  Salient points from the CEO:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This (particular) aircraft has a clean history."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Right engine was a new engine, put in March 2025."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Left engine last serviced in 2023."  Due for servicing at end of 2025 [unclear/misspoke].
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Both the engine histories are clean."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Both the pilots are exceptional pilots.  The Captain...has more than 11,500h.  FO has more than 3,400h."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No preliminary investigation by Air India.  Must wait for the DGCA to investigate.
  <br/>

  I will offer the

    The government said in a statement that the decision on where the decoding of the recorders would take place would be made after India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) has made a "due assessment" of all technical, safety and security considerations.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    AAIB's Director General GVG Yugandhar told Reuters earlier in an emailed response that the Economic Times report was "factually incorrect", but gave no further details.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The government statement did not explicitly rule out the possibility of the flight recorders being sent to the United States.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It asked for people not to speculate on what it called sensitive matters and stressed the crash probe was progressing with all necessary support from local authorities and agencies.
