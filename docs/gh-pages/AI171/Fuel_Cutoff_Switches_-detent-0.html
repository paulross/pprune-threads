     Delta airlines had a Captain do this in 1986 on a 757 out of LAX. Came within a few hundred feet of ditching. Then flew all the way to CVG with the rat hanging out!

  Not 757 - it was a 767. Second time it happened in about 12 months.

  <br/>
  Determined to be an ergonomics problem with the switch layout in the flightdeck.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Early 767s (JT9D and CF6-80A) had a supervisory "EEC" (Electronic Engine Control - Boeing still uses "EEC" to identify what most people call the FADEC on modern engines). The procedure if an EEC 'failed' was to switch both EECs off (to prevent excessive throttle stagger - unlike FADEC, the engine could operate just fine with a supervisory EEC failed).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Problem was that the EEC ON/OFF switch was located on the aisle stand - right above the fuel cutoff switches. Turned out 'muscle memory' was when the pilot reached down there, it was usually to turn the fuel ON or OFF - which is what they did. Fortunately realizing what he'd done wrong, the pilot quickly restored the switches to RUN and both engines recovered. And yes, they continued on to their destination (RAT was still deployed since there is no way to retract it in-flight).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Previous event was with JT9D engines (United IIRC). In that case, only one engine recovered (second engine went into an unrecoverable stall), they simply came back around and did a single engine landing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Realizing the ergonomic issue, the EECs were relocated to the pilot's overhead (retrofit by AD).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To the best of my knowledge, there hasn't been a repeat of an inadvertent dual engine shutdown since the EEC switches were relocated. It's also very difficult to 'accidentally' move the switches as there is a locking detent - the switch must be pulled out slightly before it can be moved to CUTOFF.

  I tend to agree. I taught ground school for the 744, 748, 777, 320 and 330. I used to tell my students the most critical phase of flight is the 3 minutes after 100 knots. That\x92s when critical TO inhibits occur and ADP\x92s (777) come online etc etc. But the elephant in the room for me is thrust reduction. On the Boeing it can be an altitude or a flap setting where the AT will reduce thrust from derated TO to CLB. For the Bus it\x92s an altitude and the crew are prompted to move the TL\x92s to the CLB detent. If at positive rate (or climb) the PM selected one or two units of flap up instead of gear up would the thrust reduction explain the aircraft\x92s response? This would startle any PF and he wouldn\x92t (muscle memory) manually move the levers back to TOGA while trying to follow the FD Bars to maintain V2 and RWY heading.
  <br>
   <br>
    If the RAT deployment is indeed confirmed then my theory is out the window\x85.

     Impossible. The switches are guarded. You need to pull them out to move them to Cutoff.

  Exactly like the action of lifting the flap lever out of detent before moving it.  What is significantly different is that you would have to do it twice.  It is that which makes it improbable unless intentional.

  The requirement to lift the cutoff switch out of the detent before moving it is an important point. However, those switches are close together and unless the the detent requires significant force I suggest that they could be operated together with one hand if that was an intentional action.

  Extremely difficult to accomplish with one hand, might even be impossible. There also would be no muscle memory to do both at the same time. I was as most pilots taught always shut down one engine at a time even at the gate to insure you never build that type of habit pattern.

     We agree that there was a lack of thrust. Possibly caused by a dual engine failure. But the sharpest frames in the video do NOT show the RAT and this is counter evidence to the RAT theory. If there were substantial technical failures who knows what sounds could be generated. I find the evidence weak at best. And we immediately get into a chicken-egg problem: did some power issue of unknown nature cause an engine failure or did a dual engine failure occur, resulting in a power loss? Both are extremely unlikely and need to be backed by quality evidence. The video is not it, in my opinion. I don't know the APU intake mechanism and whether it could open after the impact.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  To simplify the chicken/egg:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tdracer earlier confirmed that an airplane electrical power loss would allow engines to keep running , because 1) engines are fully-capable of suction feed operation in takeoff envelope (if boost pumps lost), and 2) the EECs are powered by their own PMAs when running and to substantially below idle (I recall roughly 10% N2).  Airplane powers the EEC for ground starts, prior to PMA coming online, and as backup to the PMA after that.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Related:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Engine igniters are powered by the aircraft. So theoretical full loss of aircraft power would disable Autorelight upon a flameout. Ignitors typically don't make the cut for most-essential battery-only loads because it would also take an engine flameout, and the airplane past V1 in ground roll can fly fine on one engine that can achieve takeoff thrust.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Autorelight is relevant - if there was a single-engine failure post V1, autorelight will attempt to relight the engine, so there is no need for a pilot to try to cycle the fuel switch to reset the EEC (potentially grabbing the wrong one), or to otherwise intervene. In such a circumstance, they need to trust their training. I've heard accounts that the most likely pilot instinct in such a situation would be to push the throttle(s) forward.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Finally - there was talk earlier about accidentally cutting the fuel switches - and it was duly noted that they have to be pulled out over the detent, so very unlikely.  The same cutoff effect could be achieved with the engine fire handle(s), right behind the fuel switches on the pedestal - though they are an upward pull, so also not subject to inadvertent or accidental engagement.

     They comply with a military standard that requires 40,000 cycles though the locking part is tested 20,000 times by just pulling to its full extent. Or something like that. How well that testing matches real world use is debatable.
    </div>
   </div>

  The spec sheet says 100,000 cycles.
  <br>
   Switches fail sometimes. I have changed lots of lots of malfunctioning toggle switches in my day.
   <br>
    But both at the same time?
    <br>
     It has to be a common thing happening at the same time.
     <br>
      Someone slipping both switches into a worn middle detent is such a thing though, that is one habit that could be developed. A slight bump at takeoff and they both go to cutoff.
      <br>
       Or they are worn and theres an iphone behind the throttles, as someone mentioned.
       <br>
        <br>
         The switches themselves are on-on 4 pole toggles, and doesn\x92t fail into one position over the other, and gravity would prefer the cutoff position in this design.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         I mentioned I have used my share of switches, knobs and buttons. In much larger quantities than what you find in aircraft, but without the life and death factor, and thus no SOP.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         Unexpected things happen, no one dies, but I myself brodcasted jolly sounding very inappropriate intro music over a very dark news report on the unravelling Joseph Frietzl case by dropping my phone on a switch. Several million viewers, a good chunk of which called to complain.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         Grave errors can be banal.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         Other than that, common connectors, the harness itself, I have seen a large amount of unexpected electronic things happen when those get bendt the wrong way.

  This isn\xb4t quite right. They could both have had a malfunction without this being an issue until something or someone hit them at the same time (e.g. on rotation). It\xb4s just another theory which isn\xb4t less plausible than many others.

     Or they are worn and theres an iphone behind the throttles, as someone mentioned.

     I mentioned I have used my share of switches, knobs and buttons. In much larger quantities than what you find in aircraft, but without the life and death factor, and thus no SOP.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Unexpected things happen, no one dies, but I myself brodcasted jolly sounding very inappropriate intro music over a very dark news report on the unravelling Joseph Frietzl case by dropping my phone on a switch. Several million viewers, a good chunk of which called to complain.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Grave errors can be banal.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Other than that, common connectors, the harness itself, I have seen a large amount of unexpected electronic things happen when those get bendt the wrong way.

  have a center indent option. Ie, it is either on or off, with a spring loaded lift of about 2mm needed to move it from one position to another.

  The idea is to set the switch to CUTOFF and then to ON as that resets the FADEC (the circuit that controls the engine) and hopefully clears any issues it might have. The hope is that the turbine is still rotating fast enough for the FADEC to restart it. I believe this works the same as the auto-relight feature.
  <br/>
  The turbine rotation would also provide the electrical power for that.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Do a thread search on "detent" to learn more about the construction of these switches than you ever wanted to know.

  Unfortunately the wikipost linking to it is gone, presumably a victim to the recent forum changes.
