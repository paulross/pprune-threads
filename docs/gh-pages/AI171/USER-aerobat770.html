  Question is why both engines lost power . Foreign object ingestion , contaminated fuel or both cutoff levels operated ? We do not know .
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Any autothrust discussion is misleading since every pilot in that situation will firewall the levers whatever thrust reduction was selected for TO . the same is true for the RAT discussion- if enough hydraulic pressure was generated or not . The plane pitched up last second so there obviously was control until the end . Of course , without energy pulling alone will not bring you anywhere .
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Why did both engines fail the same second as they would be cut off ???

     Even if this were a possibility, would it not be almost certain other aircraft operating from this departure point would suffer similar problems too - even if not at the TO/climb-out phase of their flights?
    </div>
   </div>

  Murphy . Maybe this was the first aircraft to receive fuel from a faulty storage tank . After that the airport was closed and nobody departed on this fuel ...
  <br>
   <br>
    Most other here discussed scenarios are nonsense , e.g the system would simply ignore a cutoff command with thrust levers above idle .

     Are you asserting that "the system would simply ignore a cutoff command with thrust levers above idle" is a nonsense statement?
     <br/>
     or
     <br/>
     Are you asserting that "the system would simply ignore a cutoff command with thrust levers above idle" is a description of how the system behaves?
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  sorry if it was not clear : when you move the switches to cutoff and the thrust levers are above idle imho the engines would NOT cutoff , the command would be ignored .

     Im pretty certain in those conditions the engines will shutdown. Haven\x92t flown the 787, but every other plane would and for good reason\x97how do you deal with an uncontrollable engine?
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  you follow the shutdown procedures , one of the first items is to retard the power lever to idle . With levers in idle they will shutdown , above idle they will not .

  I operated such guarded pull-move switches on several plane types uncounted times and not a single time in my entire pilot career i had a situation that such a switch "sits" on top of the locking gate and suddenly snaps by itself .
  <br>
   It is either positivly on or off .
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In theory i could with much fantasy imagine dirt around the locking gate that keeps it pulled where you believe its latched but imaging that
   <u>
    both
   </u>
   switches were sitting on top of the gate and snapped back at the very moment of rotation is too much fantasy for me .
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Further , even with a non working locking gate such a switch would never move by accleration forces of the plane alone , it needs positive manual input .
   <br/>
   <br/>
   their position roughly behind the thrust levers does not offer any space to store there lets say your phone which slips down and moves them .
   <br/>
   <br/>
   one more point : during the very moment of rotation there is normally not a single reason to change anything in the vicinity of the center console at all to explain why you even had your hands there .

  We can be sure this switches and their locking mechanism were carefully inspected in the wreckage .
  <br/>
  <br/>
  since there is no grounding of the 787 fleet i think nobody considers the switches were defective but it seems to be clear for the investigators they were pulled and switched to cutoff by pilot action .
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The investigation probably now concentrates by whom of them both and to find out if it was a catastrophic operation error in a mental blackout or a concious , deliberate action .
