     May I ask where this information of load shedding comes from please
     <br/>
     In my experience the APU supplies enough power to run all systems. Hydraulic pumps, fuel pumps etc

  On the 767, 757 and A330 anytime you are in single generator operations the aircraft is load shedding. The 787 with a totally different electrical system might function differently.

     I believe that particular bug is fixed, though it's always possible there's other issues causing a total AC loss.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Not really relevant to what you quoted though, as the scenario in question requires:
     <ul>
      <li>
       Engines running on centre tank fuel during takeoff
       <i>
        while the aircraft is operating normally
       </i>
       <ul>
        <li>
         We don't know for certain if this is the case. It seems to be but it's not something that happens on other families.
        </li>
       </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
       Then, total AC failure stopping fuel boost pumps.
      </li>
      <li>
       Engines suction feed from contaminated/full-of-water wing tanks.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <br/>
     The aircraft has two engines and should be able to climb out on one, plus it dropped like a
     <i>
      rock
     </i>
     . 'Significantly degraded' thrust isn't really compatible with what we saw. You'd also expect the engines to recover pretty quickly as it leveled off.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The limitations at high altitude are primarily air/volatiles degassing out of the fuel. That's not going to be much of an issue at sea level, even if the engines are a bit higher up during rotation.
     <br/>
     APU is a nice-to-have; it's on the MEL. If you lose all four generators, it's because of some major carnage in the electrical software/hardware and chances of putting the APU on line even if it's operating are very slim.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  As an electronics and software engineer who has read the AD and related materials on the 248 day bug my understanding is that:
  <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
   <li>
    The specific 248-day integer overflow was patched, and before the fix was rolled out, the AD required this system to by power cycled every 120 days to prevent overflow
   </li>
   <li>
    The PCU software still has the
    <i>
     functional requirement
    </i>
    to be able to command all AC GCUs to enter failsafe mode, this means that while the initial bug was fixed, the ability for this particular software system to command the same result is still a functional part of the architecture - presumably for safety management of the AC system
   </li>
   <li>
    This was not the first or last "software overflow error" issue in Boeing or even in the 787
   </li>
  </ol>
  Although I'm not qualified in aviation engineering I do believe from an engineering safety standpoint that this architecture creates a rare but entirely feasible scenario in which the aircraft would be without AC power for at least 30 seconds until the APU could restore it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I do agree that the engine driven pumps
  <i>
   should
  </i>
  be able to provide fuel alone, the whole point of these pumps is to keep the plane flying within
  <i>
   some
  </i>
  limitations, high altitude is one of those limitations, I propose that there may be others based on the following:
  <ul>
   <li>
    Some more knowledgable people here have proposed or countered vapour lock, fuel contamination and automatic fuel cut-off theories to various degrees - even if these are not enough on their own, loss of electrical during rotation at high temperature could combine with these in a way we have not yet considered
   </li>
   <li>
    Thrust is nonlinear, and while I'm not qualified to say how much loss of fuel flow or loss of thrust would be critical in this scenario we do know that it was a hot takeoff with significant weight and gear remaining down - I know others here have run sims but I don't think anyone has focused on specific thrust / fuel flow params
   </li>
   <li>
    While electric fuel pumps might not be physically necessary for takeoff, my final point is: why are they
    <i>
     required
    </i>
    for takeoff? Is it not to mitigate cavitation, fuel sloshing at rotation, or any other kind of problem that might be relevant here?
   </li>
  </ul>

  The manuals suggest the 787 has even more advanced load inhibition/load shedding, shedding/recovering individual loads as required for both operational and availability reasons.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Remember the 787 uses electrics for engine start, wing anti-ice, centre hydraulics, and cabin air compressors. There's some

     Thrust is non-linear and complex. Reaction engines (i.e. fans, props) are generally most efficient at minimum power - lowest excess velocity. Turbine engines are generally most efficient at high power. These cancel out somewhere in the middle. With two engines at low power, you also don't have the drag from the dead engine or the drag from the rudder countering yaw.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Cavitating destroys pumps rapidly - someone upthread said replacing the fuel pump immediately is SOP if it has suction fed. Expect end of life in tens of hours rather than tens of thousands.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Some aircraft have switched to using jet/venturi pumps powered by returned fuel, like the A220. The electric boost pumps there are mainly for redundancy and are shut down in cruise; only one in each wing tank. Some A320s replace the centre override pumps with venturi transfer pumps.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Thanks for the clarifications
  <br/>
  <br/>
  My question is then: what is the minimum loss of thrust in both engines (perhaps more relevantly expressed as a % in fuel flow reduction from expected) that could produce the profile we saw. I appreciate this is a figure with many variables including timing and rate of loss.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The reason I think this question is relevant is because we pretty much have 2 prevailing theories at this point:
  <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
   <li>
    A failure, or reduction of thrust (below idle, indicated by loss of AC generators), that somehow impacted both engines, within 20s of rotation (explaining the RAT and gear orientation)
   </li>
   <li>
    Somehow a loss of all AC power, leading somehow to a reduction of thrust or failure of engines (both engines impacted identically is assumed in this scenario since all AC is lost), and was of course below the minimum thrust needed to fly with gear down at this weight and temperature
   </li>
  </ol>
  I agree that if it is
  <i>
   completely infeasible
  </i>
  that loss of all AC power could do anything but cause thrust reduction of X where thrust minus X is not enough, even with gear down in high temperature and significant weight at the critical moment of takeoff to cause the profile we saw, then theory 2 is invalidated. I would love to invalidate any of the theories here but I do think some specific calculations, simulations or test data is needed

  The 87 load sheds as well.It's got 4 permanent magnet generators, 2 per engine, along with 2 permanent magnetic alternators, 1 per engine...these power the EECs. A 115v AC bus can power the EECs during startup, and can be used as a backup.

  Not a memory leak, but the software internal to the generator control units counted up every 10 ms on a 32-bit counter, and when it overflowed that counter, the systems would shut down as time seemed to be going backwards.

     Double pole switches. Pretty simple.You'd have to short (or open) both sets of contacts simultaneously.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     One set of poles is for the circuit power, and one set is for the switch position data.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Far more than double pole - I think it's 4-8 ish. See the number of wires in the above picture. A previous post in one of the earlier thread indicated that it was essentially one pole per function - HPSOV, LPSOV, FADEC signal, generator etc. I'm not sure which one the EAFR reads. If it was a single contact failure, you would expect to see disagreement between the various systems controlled by the switch. I think that's very unlikely given both 'failed' in the same way near simultaneously and 'recovered' when switched.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For reference, it's pretty common for industrial emergency stop buttons to have 2-3 poles: redundant poles for the actual fault switching (legislative requirement above certain hazard levels), plus an additional pole for monitoring.

     Wouldn't they already know if the detents were missing in this case? They recovered the switches and told us what position they were in at impact.

  Depends on when they identified the SB and how obvious the lack of or incorrect fitting of detents is.

  SLF: I have a small observation but I'm not sure what it means or if it has any relevance to the accident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Previously I had assumed that the ADS-B data cut out at the same time as power was lost, so I imagined that whatever caused the fairly clear loss of thrust would have happened not too long before. But this report throws a bit of a wrench in my understanding of that.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the report, the fuel cutoff switches transition from RUN to CUTOFF at or very shortly after 08:08:42 UTC. Both engines' N2 values pass below minimum idle speed and the RAT begins supplying hydraulic power at about 08:08:47. Does this not imply that the generators have already been lost? With the APU also being off (the APU inlet door is noted to start opening at 08:08:54), I would have expected ADS-B data to cut out at or before 08:08:47. But curiously FlightRadar24 at least claims to have received data frames from the aircraft until 08:08:51.640970, almost five seconds later and almost ten seconds after the transition to CUTOFF (though the last frame containing coordinates comes at 08:08:50.871005).
  <br/>

  Could anyone with relevant experience confirm how long it would take for AC power to be lost in this situation? Also, is it usual/unusual for a preliminary report like this to mention if/when the flight recorder switched to its independent power supply? I imagine it would definitely be in the final report, but I'd hoped it would be easily observable enough to be in this one.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beyond idle curiosity I'm asking because the report
  <i>
   also
  </i>
  says the no. 1 engine's cutoff switch transitioned from CUTOFF to RUN at "about 08:08:52", which oddly coincides with the last ADS-B data frame at 08:08:51.640970, and that seems important somehow. Or more likely I'm just ignorant of some quirk of the 787's electrical system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For reference FR24's CSV containing all ADS-B frames supposedly received from the aircraft can be found in their post here:

     The accident aircraft was written up for a status message of &rdquo;STAB POS XDCR&rdquo; on the previous flight, which is a message relating to implausible data from the stab trim switches. It was released from maintenance (according to the preliminary report) at 06:40UTC ahead of an 07:40UTC departure (the crash flight) with &rdquo;no fault found&rdquo;.
     <br>
      <br>
       On the 787-8, as all modern planes, switches are not cabled as dry closing contacts all the way from the switch poles to the affected end devices (FADECs in the case of fuel cutoff switches), but rather connect locally to an analogue/digital converter to encode the switch position data onto the digital comms bus ARINC629 which allows all aircraft systems to talk to one another.
       <br>
        <br>
         Are the fuel cutoff switches, which are positioned adjacent to the stab trim switches, connected to the same ADC module which produced the error message on the previous flight, which maintenance was unable to resolve before the accident flight took off? I do not know, but it must be worthy of being looked into.

  I believe the fuel cutoff switches are one of the exceptions to this. They are direct wired. Stab trim may well be too.
  <br>
   <br>
    I think they're called remote data concentrators - in many cases it is a conversion from a direct digital input to a bus signal; electronics would not call it an 'analog' input unless it was actually measuring a quantitative value.

         Was the RAT deployed manually?

        The report says,
        <br/>
        <i>
         As per the EAFR data both engines N2 values passed below minimum idle speed, and the

        This was 5 seconds after the fuel was cut off.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        It suggests to me that the RAT deployment was initiated while the engines were still above idle and generating electrical power. Obviously one of the pilots could have done it via depressing the switch, as it's a "dual engine failure/stall" memory item (see
        <a href="https://www.pprune.org/accidents-close-calls/666581-air-india-ahmedabad-accident-12th-june-2025-part-2-a-70.html#post11918946" target="_blank">

        ) that won't hurt anything.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Is there a way for the RAT to deploy while the engines are still above idle?

     I think I have seen a previous reference that the generators are disconnected when you select the switches to cutoff (or very shortly afterwards), not when the engine actually drops below idle. That could account for a few seconds of spool down time.

        What is unusual to me is the 4 second gap between moving Eng 1 fuel switch from cutoff to run, and moving Eng 2 fuel switch from cutoff to run.
        <br/>
        One would imagine that in this situation, speed of response would have been critical.

     That is a very good question IMHO.
