     Regarding the dust visible on rotation: It has nothing to do with a near overrun. The ground next to the runway is dry earth. On rotation the plane turns a bit to the right (into the wind) and the jet blast of the L/H engine hits the dirt on the left side of the runway.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I think it\x92s the lift vortex being dumped from the wingtip as he rotates, and throwing the dust into the air. Normally you don\x92t see it on a clean/ dry runway but it happens on every flight.

  Exactly like the action of lifting the flap lever out of detent before moving it.  What is significantly different is that you would have to do it twice.  It is that which makes it improbable unless intentional.

  I fully understand how that is coded, thanks to Tdracer for going in detail of DAL -A certified. However IMHO considering the unusual event, a bug on that piece of code should not be discounted.

     While you are still on the ground or on lift-off? In the air yes, to be able to use slightly less rudder but not while on the ground.

     Who would start the engine out procedure at just 100-200ft AGL? No airline teaches that and it doesn't have any advantage. You would only get the gear up. The shutdown can wait until at least 400ft AGL and once in a stable OEI climb.

  Yes. Other aircraft systems get the information through the FADECs (including the DFDRs) but the FADECs itself are isolated including independent alternators (PMG). There are two FADECs per engine and each has it's own throttle position sensor. That was explained by
  <a href="https://www.pprune.org/members/414340-tdracer" rel="nofollow">

     Due to the fuel pressures of the feed pumps (that are all running) the center tank fuel is used first. In case the pump in the center tank fails or the center tank is empty the fuel from the wing will be used w/o any switch over taking place as the wing feed pumps are already running.

  Surely that's not quite right? If the center tank has fuel, both engines will be fed from the center tank. Only once/if the center tank doesn't have fuel, will the engines be fed from their respective wing tanks.

  I'm afraid that this reconstituted thread is more polluted worse than the original as mods try to hold back this flood of sewage.  While there are multiple examples of air disasters caused solely by astonishingly egregious malfeasance by pilots, I see absolutely no point in unsupported speculation about such things.  I can't ever say "no professional aircrew would ever do that" but spouting off random theories with no evidence and no practical experience or knowledge of the actual operations involved is really annoying and pointless.  If you are a GA pilot, SLF with an engineering degree or a sim enthusiast then maybe, just maybe, you can manage to ask an intelligent question--preferrably one that hasn't already been asked and answered five times already.  But please keep your inane hypotheses and conclusions to yourself for now.

  While I disagree with the arrogance of the post generating the conflagration (and the \x91here\x92s how it went down\x92) if one rephrases and softens up the language a bit (and considering how many other low probability scenarios have been posted) the point has some validity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In jet aircraft how many systems related dual engine flameouts have occurred at low altitude ? Excluding FOD \x97 birds and ice (which presumably aren\x92t a factor here) how many systems caused dual engine flameouts have occurred ?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As opposed to how many engine failures, thrust losses, or shutdowns have been caused by crew members grabbing at improper levers under stress or setting wrong data (I\x92ll include Air Florida in that).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Not meant to be self - indicting by any means but if one is looking at probabilities and far-fetched scenarios you can\x92t exclude crew actions as a part of that.

  Yes, there's another snag in the million dollar Q for the explanation. If the MN4 microprocessor can run amok, so could perhaps the TCMA not exactly act as intended. But I take in both your pertinent comments and will (as per the mods advice) from now on sit on my hands and only read until the prelim report hopefully soon!

  Actually that's not quite true.  Thrust far higher than what's being commanded by the thrust lever - it doesn't have to be at idle.  But even with a CPU failure commanding high thrust (relative to TL position), the odds of that happening to two engines at the same time is astronomical.
  <br/>
  BTW, I don't know if there is any 'crosstalk' of TCMA activation between engines on the 787.  I know we don't do any crosstalk of other engines info on the 747-8, but the 787 is far more integrated, and the amount of data that can put on that ethernet based data bus is massive.
  <br/>
  My knee jerk is that they wouldn't crosstalk TCMA status between engines, but the reality is I really don't know.

     Regarding the momentum: As the first few seconds of the climb were normal compared to previous T/Os of the same flight (speed &amp; altitude, confirmed by comparison of the RAW ADS-B data) I don't believe the engine failure happened before or on lift-off.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Could you please elaborate on that?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  FR24 did do that raw ADS-B data comparison. Remember the GPS position and barometric altitude are sent by the aircraft itself. The altitude is sent in 25 ft intervals, so a shallow curve that is smooth in reality looks janky in the data, due to the rounding of the numbers. From

     We&rsquo;ve taken data from AI171 departures for the month prior to the accident flight&mdash;including two previous operations by VT-ANB&mdash;and overlaid their departure paths on the data from AI171 on 12 June. The accident flight is in red, while all other flights are the blue paths. The data shown here is the uncalibrated barometric altitude, so the data is not above ground level, but it is consistent to itself.

   </div>
  </div>
  The red line is the accident flight, and it covers approximately 4.3 seconds.
  <br/>
  Obviously the altitudes are all uncorrected for barometric pressure, which would've varied with the weather on that day; you kind of have to mentally shift the lines vertically downward. Now I looked for, but couldn't find, the post in the old thread where the rotation was triangulated\xb9, but I remember that it was near the turnoff to the high-speed taxiway, so a few seconds ahead of this ADS-B capture. We only have the video to show us what occurred then.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That means the ADS-B data doesn't really tell us whether the first few seconds of the climb were normal or not.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When we compare the red line to the blue lines, the data tells us the climb rate had already decayed significantly before the accident aircraft passed over the end of the runway, because the red flight path is much more shallow than the blue flight paths.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Please correct me if I'm wrong: to my eye, the data alone does not show that the engines must have failed after rotation, because the data does not demonstrate a normal climb rate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But likewise, the engines can't have failed much before rotation:

     This aircraft has got airborne well within the requirements of FAR 25 under which it was certified. It has over 1250m ahead of it passing around 35' based on the video from behind, so the FMC data was not incorrect, the thrust up until after TO was not incorrect, and the CG is not out of range, the time to rotate is within expected range, and the attitude at liftoff is not excessive, the plane is not heavier than expected.
    </div>
   </div>

  For completeness' sake: you can look at the CCTV video, consider the 787's wingspan a flying 200 ft yardstick, and hopefully agree that the aircraft did not get much higher than 200 ft AAL, if that.

     You can triangulate the camera location using the aircraft holding short for takeoff and the road sign. Then draw a line from there just to the right of the instrumentation building and you'll find the aircraft rotated with about 4000 feet of runway remaining (11000+ runway length).

     confirmed the PMGs for the FADECs in the first AI171 thread. He even explained the logic behind it and the connections with the onboard electronics:
     <br/>
     - Each engine has a PMG for the FADECs
     <br/>
     - Only for engine start the FADECs are powered by the aircraft
     <br/>
     - Once the engines are running, this connection is opened
     <br/>
     - It is verified, that the FADECs are then no longer connected to the aircraft electrical system. A failure to open the connection triggers a "No dispatch" message
     <br/>
     - In case the PMG fails, the FADECs are once again powered by the aircraft electrical system
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Yes. That is what I have read here, that is my assumption, that is how Airbus does it,
  <i>
   that is what makes sense
  </i>
  .
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But I am being told elsewhere by someone with an A&amp;P badge that that is not quite the whole story, and that the FADEC PMGs do double-duty as the flight control PMGs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I am hoping for some documentation to confirm/refute that.

     worked on engine/airframe integration for Boeing. He did that for the GEnx on the B747-8. I would guess he knows more about those systems than some guy with an A&amp;P badge.
    </div>
   </div>

  On the other hand, the guy with the A&amp;P badge has to do diagnostics and trace faults across various systems and subsystems (and fix them where there's a repair procedure available).
  <br/>
  They get to look into all of the various write-ups from the pilots when the aircraft and its systems don't work quite as they are expected to.
  <br/>
  Let's not dismiss that kind of input without due consideration for what it looks like from the point of view of someone whose task it is to keep things working.
  <br/>
  Pilots run into similar oddities - well, it's supposed to do this, per the manual, but it's doing something differently - now and again, right?

  Never do math in public. You are correct. The center tank should have had a significant amount of fuel at takeoff. Probably at least 40,000 lbs.
