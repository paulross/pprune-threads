     There has been discussion recently about a procedure that involves moving the fuel switches to CUTOFF and then back to RUN following a dual engine failure.
     <br>
      <br>
       Attached is an image of a page from the Air India 787 Training Manual that discusses this procedure.
       <br>
        <br>
         I am submitting this without comment or opinion.
         <br>

  Nobody seems to have discussed this.  If I'm reading it right (and I'm not a pilot), it seems to be suggesting that in the event of a dual engine failure, a restart should be attempted while the engine still has high RPM?  It also seems to be indicating that fuel switch resetting should be attempted if the restart has failed to start the engine?

  That's how I read this:

  <img alt="" class="post_inline_image" src="https://cimg6.ibsrv.net/gimg/pprune.org-vbulletin/797x88/de_restrt_d43562faacc2612211790a673cbbd1d4f62886f2.jpg"/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Obviously, because it's going to require quick action to catch high RPM. And maybe that's what they tried.

  Not sure about this. I think it's saying Resetting to initiate a Restart attempt. Not repeating it.

  It is not inconceivable to me that a human being who THINKS they've had a dual engine failure at possibly the worst time imaginable (correctly or incorrectly) and has not taken the time to confirm, or take it all in and  has immediately launched into memory items. I could certainly foresee one being rather startled by the energy state and the rapidly approaching buildings.
  <br/>
  I'm not saying that this happened to this crew but it certainly could happen to someone. People do weird !!!! under high stress. There is an initial "oh !!!!, what's going on" then the training kicks in. Often at super fast rate and the challenge becomes slowing it all down.

  The bloody master warning on the Airbus for smoke in the forward Lav used to get me everytime. Was always at night over the ocean too.

  A couple of points if I may......
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I don't see it written in the 787 FCOM but I have always been told that the action of resetting the Engine Cutoff switches in the event of a dual engine failure, is merely backing up what the FADECs have already done.  If there is an 'engine event' the FADECs will manage ignition and fuel-flow to restore the thrust that was demanded before the event.  If that management has failed then the manual resetting may be more successful.  (The same holds true for the RAT, manual selection is merely backing up the auto-deployment).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Any airline pilot will tell you that executing an in-flight relight on a big engine, no matter if it is by electric start, windmilling RPM or cross-bleed assisted, can take between 1 and 3 minutes to restore power.  This aircraft was airborne for less that 30 seconds.  No pilot in his right mind would prioritise an in-flight relight procedure, in a situation where they had neither the time, the height nor the speed for it to succeed.  I have no doubt the crew focussed entirely on pointing the aircraft at the clearest area they could see, to mitigate what would inevitably follow.
