     If TCMA cut fuel flow while still on the runway the aircraft would have been decelerating from the moment it lifted off, which is not what the ADS-B data indicates. The kinetic energy in the rotating parts of the engine wouldn't add much speed to the aircraft as the engines run down with no more energy being added via fuel.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I was not aware that we have granular ADS-B data from the a/c itself showing airspeed post rotation (rather than speed interpolated from GPS). Apologies if I have missed it. If it does show acceleration after takeoff I tend to agree with you.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In no particular order, here are some more thoughts on TCMA having caught up on the thread:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If you cut the fuel from two big engines at take-off power, there must be some delay before n2 decays below the threshold for generation (below idle n2), the generators disconnect and RAT deploys. GEnx have relatively long spool up/down times as the fan is so large (and would be exposed to 170+kts of ram air). Perhaps someone has a view on how long this would be, but I imagine it could easily be 10s or more between fuel cut off and RAT deployment. On AI171 the RAT appears to be already deployed at the beginning of the bystander video. That starts c. 13s before impact and around 17s after rotation. This does not prove anything except that the supposed shut down must have happened very close to rotation and
  <u>
   could
  </u>
  have happened just before rotation while the a/c was on the ground.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As a thought experiment, imagine if ANA985 in 2019 had decided to go around. The a/c rotates and is ~50 ft above the runway, suddenly both engines spooling down, very little runway left to land on and no reverse thrust available. I am struck by how similar this scenario is to AI171. This theory would require there to have been unexpected thrust lever movement in the moments before rotation - but plausibly one pilot moving to reject, followed by an overrule or change of heart - or even a simple human error such as the recent BA incident at LGW - could achieve this. This is perhaps more likely that any sensor fault that you would expect to only impact a single engine given the redundancy of systems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tdracer writes that a key requirement of TCMA is to identify an engine runaway in the event of an RTO, in order to allow the a/c to stop on the runway. This will have been tested extensively - it is a big leap to imagine a false activation could be triggered. It did happen on ANA985 but through a very unusual set of inputs including application of reverse (albeit this latter point may not be relevant if TCMA logic does not distinguish between the reverser being deployed or not).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Incidentally there is an assumption the TCMA software version in place on the ANA flight had already been patched and fixed on AI171. That probably is the case but I am not sure it is a known fact.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In summary I remain baffled by this tragic accident. I have not yet read anything that explicitly rules out TCMA activation and it remains a possibility due to the vanishingly small number of factors that could shut down two engines at apparently the exact same moment when they have fully redundant systems. Fuel contamination, for example, has typically impacted each engine a few minutes (at least) apart. I am also cautious (as others have pointed out) of a form of confirmation bias about Boeing software systems with four-letter acronyms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In my mind the cause could equally well be something completely different to anything suggested on this thread, that will only become clear with more evidence. All of the above also incorporates a number of theories, i.e. that there was an engine shutdown - that are not conclusively known.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thank you to the mods for an excellent job.

  Would moving the levers to idle during t/o not engage RTO? I.e. we would see spoilers deployed and maximum braking applied if that were the case?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Or are you suggesting the levers moved back but not exactly to idle for RTO to kick in?

  There has been much discussion here about RAT deployment. Various claims either way have been made, based on individual perspectives of available video and audio.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I am very mindful of just how awful a tragedy this is, and have significant misgivings about disproportionate interest in others misfortune where it carries no purpose, but also recognise that for some people knowing and learning what happened ASAP could be very important, particularly given the present circumstances.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thus while I sincerely hope that early detail from investigators will give some clarity, in an effort to reduce needless speculation regarding RAT deployment I have taken:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  (1) an audio sample from the video of AI171 passing by in which people claim to hear a RAT
  <br/>
  (2) an audio sample from a 787 video with RAT deployed on test by Boeing
  <br/>
  (3) an audio sample from a JAL 787 video with RAT deployed
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And passed these through a FFT in order to gain a more quantitative view of the noise spectra from each event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A spectrogram of the results is presented below. I hesitate to make any conclusions per se, but observe that there are similarities as well as divergences between them. In all three samples there is a relatively consistent signal roughly centered in the range 113-146Hz that could be what gives the characteristic 'buzz' sound of (apparently) a RAT in operation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  JAL ~141Hz
  <br/>
  Test ~146Hz
  <br/>
  AI171 ~113-134Hz (prob doppler variation here)
  <br/>
  <br/>

  <br/>

  <br/>
  <i>
   Spectral comparison #2 AI171, B787 with RAT, JAL 787 with RAT
  </i>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  These frequencies seem consistent(ish) with what I got from this video [[url]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1r3CuRwjPc] in which a 787 RAT is being tested - albeit in this case the blades are hydraulically powered and not driven as a turbine. This test showed a fundamental frequency of 135Hz with relevant harmonics above (the second harmonic at 270Hz is higher SPL, no weighting):
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>

  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's important to note that the initial recordings are necessarily different; these are not controlled conditions, the recording equipment is probably quite diverse and almost certainly not ideal, and the environmental conditions will also be different. Moreover all of these audio samples have come from video files referenced here, one has no way of determining the provenance or veracity of these sources and, crucially, I have no prior experience of analysing/extracting RAT acoustic fingerprints (nor have I sampled 'control' audio of a 787 passing by /without/ RAT!).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Additionally it's been quite a long time since I did any work with [turbine] noise so given these and other variables I'm not prepared to make any declarations per se, but perhaps more knowledgeable people could. That said, my feeling from what I see is that RAT deployment is not
  <i>
   dis
  </i>
  proven, and that the apparent fundamental frequency difference between the samples
  <i>
   may
  </i>
  be explainable by - amongst other things - difference in a/c airspeed, bearing in mind that AI171 was on TO, the others were landing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ultimately what I've done here is extremely rudimentary and while it would be possible to go into much more depth I'd hope that more definitive answer would be forthcoming by then, however if anyone wants to discuss specific methodology etc off-line please PM, no wish to add to noise on this thread.

  Looking at the detailed ADS-B data released by FR24 and the June 10 AI171 data, I noticed that the two flights show the following data at similar points in the takeoff phase
  <br/>
  Height :575ft

  Speed :182kts

  Even though it is impossible that the takeoff weight and outside air conditions are the same on the two flights, we guess that there was nothing wrong at this moment.

  I wonder if those reported eight Air Indian 787-8's pulled in for 'looking at', have had any issues with failed power systems, as in the reported and video of this aircraft, having no IFE systems working.,
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wasn't there a post by someone who claimed to have been a (ex) crew member of the aircraft who said that there have been a number a complaints about power issues in that aircraft and it was brough to management's attention, but nothing was apparently taken seriously...?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If it is an AI maintenance issue and considering that the Black Box has been looked at for days now.

  <br/>
  <br/>
  And as mentioned, if it was a 'software' bug relating to engine cutoff's or other inherent engine issues, then the whole fleet would be grounded - HOWEVER - as in the 737 MCAS debacle, it was known for a long time before the crashes that 'something was wrong' with the pitch control - as was being reported on NASA's own NSRS database even IIRC years before.

     Wasn't there a post by someone who claimed to have been a (ex) crew member of the aircraft who said that there have been a number a complaints about power issues in that aircraft and it was brough to management's attention, but nothing was apparently taken seriously...?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     If it is an AI maintenance issue and considering that the Black Box has been looked at for days now.
     <br/>
     <acronym title="As far as I know">
      AFAIK
     </acronym>
     , there's two black boxes, each with identical data, so only one is needed (theoretically), Plus,
     <acronym title="As far as I know">
      AFAIK
     </acronym>
     , the data can be retrieved remotely on these newer boxes.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     And as mentioned, if it was a 'software' bug relating to engine cutoff's or other inherent engine issues, then the whole fleet would be grounded - HOWEVER - as in the 737 MCAS debacle, it was known for a long time before the crashes that 'something was wrong' with the pitch control - as was being reported on NASA's own NSRS database even IIRC years before.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     And again (I made a post somewhere months ago), why on earth doesn't any airport that is say classed as international, have 4k cameras installed.
     <br/>
     Look at how many pages have been "were the flaps out on takeoff", and such like, "Ran out of runway" - even (maybe), Engine thrust could be seen, bogey conditions, tire conditions,
     <br/>
     Could answer a lot of information as to "Was the aircraft in good configuration on Takeoff/Landing',
     <br/>
     The world has watched hours upon hours of potato cam footage of AI-171 taking off - plus a handheld phone footage taken by a kid, and that's the best a trillion $$ airline industry can do..?
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Why?  Because it\x92s a low value added installation.  Cameras might satisfy the public and spotters desire for instantaneous news, but it wouldn\x92t appreciably add to safety.  VAAH has been in operation for 88 years, its last fatal hull loss was almost 40 years ago, landing in fog where a camera would record nothing.  There are better safety improvements to spend the money on.

  I spent some time this morning doing a further quantitative analysis of the flight path of AI171, however I've come to the view that is of little real use to anyone, so I won't be presenting it at this time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  What I do want to say though, particularly after what I saw much earlier this morning, and what I recently read about the young man who took the video many have seen, is a heartfelt acknowledgment to anyone reading this thread who is a survivor, witness, relative, responder, or simply anyone directly affected by this tragedy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As someone who, unfortunately, has been in a not-dissimilar situation I want to tell you that
  <b>
   it's *not* your fault
  </b>
  , that it's normal to feel angry, or guilty, or sad, or even not to be able to feel anything at all. It's ok to want to cry at the oddest of moments, to want to kick the hell out of something, to be unable to sleep - or to just to curl up and go to sleep for a long time. This could hit you weeks from now, or it may never happen at all, it will worry you when it does - or not - but y'know, strangely, that's ok too. We can rarely control such strong emotion, it's simply the way we frail humans work, and we don't all feel, or express things, in the same way.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  People will tell you that time heals all. You may not believe that right now, and most of us will never be able to unfeel, unsee, unhear, or unsmell, but the passage of time
  <i>
   will
  </i>
  ease these things. It may take years, or not, but it's ok, there
  <i>
   is
  </i>
  a future.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If you know someone that's involved, give them a hug, or don't give them a hug if that's what they need too. Space, peace, quiet, or conversely keeping really busy at work with people around are all mechanisms different people may use to cope. Keeping a watching eye and 'being right there' if/when you're needed is perhaps the best thing you can do, along with understanding if that person wants distance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And, it might seem unbelievably crass that we're discussing what happened to you, to your friends or relatives, but for some of us it's our way of helping - or coping - when we feel your tragedy so strongly. It's a practical way we can help ourselves and others understand, or learn, or even prevent someone else suffering the same way. There will be people on this forum who get this more keenly than others, but no-one intends to hurt.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For those that
  <i>
   are
  </i>
  interacting here, it behooves us all to be aware of the humanity, to remember
  <i>
   before
  </i>
  we say anything that real people are hurting right now, and that on this public forum whatever we say could be read by anyone at any time, forever.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sincerely, FP.

     I wonder if those reported eight Air Indian 787-8's pulled in for 'looking at', have had any issues with failed power systems, as in the reported and video of this aircraft, having no IFE systems working.,

  In the US at least, unions would heavily object to 4k cams everywhere at an airport. Inevitable, the footage would be used by corporate to critique pilots.  Some how, some way, the bean counters would find a way to monitor the footage to try and save a penny.  There have been many calls to place cameras in the cockpits.....100% unions would fight this and be willing to strike over this.

     Regarding the momentum: As the first few seconds of the climb were normal compared to previous T/Os of the same flight (speed &amp; altitude, confirmed by comparison of the RAW ADS-B data) I don't believe the engine failure happened before or on lift-off.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Could you please elaborate on that?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  FR24 did do that raw ADS-B data comparison. Remember the GPS position and barometric altitude are sent by the aircraft itself. The altitude is sent in 25 ft intervals, so a shallow curve that is smooth in reality looks janky in the data, due to the rounding of the numbers. From

     We&rsquo;ve taken data from AI171 departures for the month prior to the accident flight&mdash;including two previous operations by VT-ANB&mdash;and overlaid their departure paths on the data from AI171 on 12 June. The accident flight is in red, while all other flights are the blue paths. The data shown here is the uncalibrated barometric altitude, so the data is not above ground level, but it is consistent to itself.
    </span>
    <img alt="" class="post_inline_image" src="https://cimg2.ibsrv.net/gimg/pprune.org-vbulletin/1024x741/ai171_comparative_departure_paths_1024x741_c96c8c783c3d0ca32bf55503e317e528f4caae35.jpg"/>
   </div>
  </div>
  The red line is the accident flight, and it covers approximately 4.3 seconds.
  <br/>
  Obviously the altitudes are all uncorrected for barometric pressure, which would've varied with the weather on that day; you kind of have to mentally shift the lines vertically downward. Now I looked for, but couldn't find, the post in the old thread where the rotation was triangulated\xb9, but I remember that it was near the turnoff to the high-speed taxiway, so a few seconds ahead of this ADS-B capture. We only have the video to show us what occurred then.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That means the ADS-B data doesn't really tell us whether the first few seconds of the climb were normal or not.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When we compare the red line to the blue lines, the data tells us the climb rate had already decayed significantly before the accident aircraft passed over the end of the runway, because the red flight path is much more shallow than the blue flight paths.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Please correct me if I'm wrong: to my eye, the data alone does not show that the engines must have failed after rotation, because the data does not demonstrate a normal climb rate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But likewise, the engines can't have failed much before rotation:

     This aircraft has got airborne well within the requirements of FAR 25 under which it was certified. It has over 1250m ahead of it passing around 35' based on the video from behind, so the FMC data was not incorrect, the thrust up until after TO was not incorrect, and the CG is not out of range, the time to rotate is within expected range, and the attitude at liftoff is not excessive, the plane is not heavier than expected.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  For completeness' sake: you can look at the CCTV video, consider the 787's wingspan a flying 200 ft yardstick, and hopefully agree that the aircraft did not get much higher than 200 ft AAL, if that.

     You can triangulate the camera location using the aircraft holding short for takeoff and the road sign. Then draw a line from there just to the right of the instrumentation building and you'll find the aircraft rotated with about 4000 feet of runway remaining (11000+ runway length).

  - It is verified, that the FADECs are then no longer connected to the aircraft electrical system. A failure to open the connection triggers a "No dispatch" message

  Yes. That is what I have read here, that is my assumption, that is how Airbus does it,
  <i>
   that is what makes sense
  </i>
  .
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But I am being told elsewhere by someone with an A&amp;P badge that that is not quite the whole story, and that the FADEC PMGs do double-duty as the flight control PMGs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I am hoping for some documentation to confirm/refute that.

     Tata group chairman (majority owner of Air India) N. Chandrasekaran had a TV interview with Times Now, an English-language news group in India. I haven't seen the full video (blocked from the USA but someone will surely upload to YouTube soon), but there are some summaries and quotes from the interview appearing on various US sites.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Below are some interesting quotes from an MSN article (
     <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-in/money/topstories/air-india-chairman-n-chandrasekaran-offers-apology-says-jet-had-no-red-flags-new-engine-findings-due-in-30-days/ar-AA1GYiEZ" target="_blank">
      https://www.msn.com/en-in/money/tops...ys/ar-AA1GYiEZ
     </a>
     ), including a claim that both pilots but especially the FO had more experience than previously reported:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     \x93There are speculations about human error, speculations about airlines, speculations about engines, maintenance, all kinds,\x94 he said. \x93But the fact that I know so far is this particular aircraft, this specific tail, AI-171 has a clean history. As for the engines, the right engine was a new engine put in March 2025. The left engine was last serviced in 2023 and due for its next maintenance check in December 2025. Both engine histories are clean,\x94 he told Times Now. \x93There were no red flags or maintenance issues,\x94 Chandrasekaran said. \x93Never been safety concerns raised, Dreamliners have been operating for a long time.\x94
     <br/>
     <br/>

  Interesting what is not said. While Chandrasekaran enumerates some of the theories about the cause of the crash ("human error, speculations about airlines, speculations about engines, maintenance, all kinds,\x94) the only speculation he goes on to refute is maintenance of the engines - leaving the other possibilities still out there..

   The seat back story

 <div id="post_message_11905688">
  @ferry pilot and others who mentioned the seat back collapsing: That was from an entirely unrelated incident on Air India Express flight 611 in 2018 which got poorly rehashed / fakenewsed into a bogus theory over the last week. It was a 737. It did *not* happen on AI171.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For what it's worth, the AIX 611 story in 2018 involved a 737 captain's seat back being overtightened and suddenly collapsing backwards during the takeoff roll. He had been guarding the thrust levers and reflexively grabbed them when falling back, causing a thrust reduction from 98% N1 to 75% N1 or thereabouts. Control was immediately transferred to the other pilot but the inadvertent thrust change was not corrected immediately, and the plane took off a few seconds later with a tail strike, scraping the runway, flying through the localizer and demolishing part of the airport perimeter wall with its landing gear. During the climb, the flight crew ran several system checks and landing gear tests to reassure themselves the plane was fine, then proceeded with the flight, pressurizing the aircraft and whatnot. They evidently did not consult the tail strike procedure. Many hours later they were ordered by company to divert and land quickly after the damage was seen at the airport. After landing, the plane was found to have a fair bit of damage, including part of the perimeter wall's barbed wire fencing material wrapped around the landing gear. But zero injuries, and the plane was fixed and flew again.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's an entertaining story because of the cause and the happy ending, but had nothing to do with AI171, for which we all await the preliminary report.

    The black box from the Air India flight AI171 that crashed in Ahmedabad on June 12 has been found damaged and may need to be sent to the United States for further data retrieval, according to government sources. Officials indicated that the final decision will rest with the Indian aviation authorities, but the device could be flown to Washington DC for evaluation by the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Technically, the &ldquo;black box&rdquo; includes two crucial components: the Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) and the Flight Data Recorder (FDR). These devices are essential for reconstructing the events leading up to the crash, offering both voice recordings from the cockpit and a detailed record of the aircraft&rsquo;s flight parameters. Due to damage sustained in the crash and fire, India may require the specialized equipment and expertise of the NTSB to recover and interpret the remaining data.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If the device is sent abroad, a team of Indian officials is expected to accompany it to ensure compliance with all security and procedural standards throughout the process.

     Except that the PF does not immediately get the cue that the power is backing off, because he removed his hand from the power levers at V1.
     <b>
      If he sees the Flight Directors indicating down after take off.... of course he will ignore that command and maintain the normal 14deg NU +/- for the expected all-engines climb.
     </b>
     However when the speed starts to decay he starts to get the message all is not well and tries to salvage the situation. If the FD goes into altitude capture then the autothrottle becomes speed-on-throttle. Unfortunately the AT logic presumes you are following the FD. If you are now NOT following FD commands then the results become unpredictable. On correct speed but above FCU selected altitude = throttles close.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  The EK 777 (EK231) low level altitude capture incident did not include ignoring the FD command with a sensible pitch-up. They exceeded 200kts while still on the runway and exceeded 250kts before climbing above a couple of hundred feet (the reports say 262kts at 175' but I don't know if that's adjusted for QNH). Apparently they had 00000' set and there was no FD pitch up command. No thrust issue in this case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  EK231 had thrust but no pitch. AI171 had pitch but no thrust.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There's less information about the Air NZ low level altitude capture, I don't know how it compares.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To be clear, I don't presume that AI171 had a low level ALT capture. It appears to have had a loss of thrust for an undetermined reason.

  No, it's not. You got that value from ADS-B, which is barometric altitude at standard pressure, and when you correct for that, the highest value is ~100 ft. AAL.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Instead, look at the CCTV video, and consider that the wing span of the aircraft is ~200 ft. I hope you'll agree AI171 didn't come close to 400 ft. AAL at any point.

  Reported 625' pressure altitude, elevation 189', QNH 1001.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  So they only got to around 100' height, half the wing span of a Boeing 787? I think it looks higher than that.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  189' elevation, QNH1001, the pressure altitude should be around 550'. First readout from ADS-B is 575', highest is 625'. I did not look up if runway departure end is much different there than aerodrome elevation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Interesting that the readout of pressure altitude doesn't get lower again, after 625', which could support the total loss of all AC (and most DC power?). Transponder possibly stopped working, but one of the pilots was able to transmit a mayday call. So they must have had some kind of electricity available.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  So what I mentioned about THR REF / VNAV SPD is probably not applicable. Yes, I did not account for the QNH initially, which makes closer to 100' than 400' AGL.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I will revert to await the official findings then, with a substantial loss of electricity seeming more and more plausible.
