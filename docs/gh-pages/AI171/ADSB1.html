     Would it be possible to determine from the video audio wheter the
     <b>
      edit: engine
     </b>
     fan noise (RPM) maches with a normal take off? I know that&rsquo;s a long shot and I&rsquo;m already very impressed by your work, thank you for sharing it.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  It's the elephant in the room regarding the audio, isn't it, but I am not prepared to say either way. There simply is too much city background noise/ambience to discern this from the engine noise from a landing 787.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Of course one taking off would have a different signature. If anyone can point point to one taking off with the rat out we could compare.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  What I find interesting is that I don&rsquo;t see any evidence in the audio of the engine spooling down, which would leave a recogniseable pattern in the audio one should think. So either it is down so much that the fan rpm is down to windmilling already, or it is simply low enough in volume to be already masked by the ambience.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  So taking this and moving into speculative territory for a moment, I think I read somewhere that the video with audio starts 17 seconds after the wheels left the ground.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Provided the engines were windmilling the video audio since I haven't been able to find any obvious spool down, can anyone say anything meaningful on how long it takes for the engines to spool down to windmilling rpm?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  we can then backtrack from the point the video starts. How does that timing then coincide with the ADS-B data ceasing to transmit, for instance?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putting back in the more strictly data-driven hat, I am not prepared to say so far anything about the engine working or not. You guys know more anout why the rat is out.

  Given the loads on the generators etc. at TO, I would say it won't take very long for the engine to spool down. Maybe around 5-7 seconds. Any differing opinions?

  There could be other reasons not connected with the aircraft systems,
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But certainly loss of engines or electrics that caused deployment of the RAT (if that was the case) would be accompanied by a bunch of load-shedding, which would in all likelihood include the transponder.

  I guess you have to make a post on just this one item to get it noticed!
  <br/>
  But I agree that this piece of data deserves close attention, and is potentially confirmatory of certain scenarios which lead to electrical power loss.
  <br/>
  I'm no expert on Flight Aware's ADS-B data, but other posts here show other flights taking off on this runway happily reporting data further down the runway and (well) after takeoff.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  How else do you explain the cessation of ADS-B data from this flight from shortly after takeoff until the crash?

     What concerns me a little bit is if indeed AC power is lost, would the suction feed inlets in the wing tanks provide enough fuel flow to maintain TO thrust?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I know the system is designed to achieve this in a situation where all of the AC powered boost pumps are lost. But what about in a real situation...
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Could this cause a degradation of thrust? Even the slightest decrease..

  A slight decrease in two engines is still far better than a loss of one engine, and that has to be manageable.

  787 has four main AC buses. Cannot find information on the standby/emergency buses but I would probably expect two.

  There's a list of equipment operable on battery/RAT here, but I'm not sure which (if any) is the transponder (26:10):

     Is that with the B787? Because all buses can fly without APU. Those days at work are ####ty, tho

  I think the post you replied to was in the context of mandating APU on for takeoff. Could just say "on if available", though.

     Have been going through the thread but cannot remember if we discussed and excluded the gear pins? There seems to have been more than enough turnaround time.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I can't see how gear pins would stop you doing anything more than raising the gear. They don't cause engine failure, RAT extension, or uncommanded flap retraction.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If you had gear pins

   and

  an engine loss, I could maybe see climb rate being zero or slightly negative. Not the brick impression we see here.

     There have been a couple comments regarding the tilt of the bogies not corresponding to the landing configuration which have taken this as an indicator for an attempted (but failed) retraction.
     <br/>
     I don't think anybody has so far confirmed which of the two positions the bogie would have without hydraulic pressure, but I would strongly think it is the one used in the retraction/extension cycle and not the landing configuration, for the simple reason that otherwise the gravity drop would potentially not work (I assume it is tilted for the stowing because it would otherwise not fit).
     <br/>
     Maybe someone with concrete knowledge can confirm this?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     This would then only confirm that the bogies were unpressurized (likely because of loss of hydraulics, but of course could also still be a partial retraction that stopped for some reason)
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I did raise this earlier... FCOMs say that the bogies remain in the stowed tilt after a gravity drop, but I don't know if that's because the gear has springs to hold it that way without hydraulics, or just they close the valves on the hydraulics so it stays in the last commanded position without pressure.

     We can debate over a poor quality photo but the audio evidence presented earlier today is pretty conclusive.. The RAT was out.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Extremely likely the RAT was out:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  1. there are multiple frames of the video showing ' something' at the position where the RAT is located under the fuselage
  <br/>
  2. the sound in the video which is very similar to a deployed RAT
  <br/>
  3. the sound analysis posted here by multiple people
  <br/>
  last but not least
  <br/>
  4. the aircraft stopped transmitting ADSB data shortly after the rotating. This indicates an electrical failure. Other aircraft ADSB data was picked up by FR24 receivers indication there is a good reception of the signal in that area.

  People really need to stop using FR24 data if they don't understand it.

  This FR24 recording of AI171

  only consists of 4 unique ADS-B data messages. The first two were on the apron/taxiway. Then one at the runway intersection. And the fourth and last one just after the aircraft became airborne. That's all.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two last ADS-B data messages are more than 4 minutes apart. It was 8:04 UTC when they entered the runway at the intersection. The next and last data point was received at 8:08 UTC.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The map view connects these dots, so it looks like a proper track. But in reality the ADS-B receiver barely received anything. It's therefore silly to argue the aircraft stopped transmitting ADS-B data based on this poor recording. The only thing you can say with certainty is that FR24's ADS-B receiver at Ahmedabad has really, really poor coverage...

  FR24 has stated that they processed additional frames and have published this separately.  There are links to this earlier in the thread.  What you see is the first data point is immediately after liftoff and then they are regular for a bit and then they stop.  Apparently at least half of the runway has poor coverage and that is what led to the early conjectures that they had done an intersection takeoff.  If you look at tracks from other flights from this airport, you'll see the spotty coverage on the first half of 23, but departing flights seem to have good data.  YMMV, but that's what I saw when I looked at a few other flights.

  1stSpotter: Your point #4 is well taken. I had seen a graph higher up in this that that showed altitude and evidence of ADSB transmissions but then as you noted the transmissions stopped soon after rotation. Well spotted suggesting some kind of electrical supply interruption. The engines can still run in this situation but I don't know for how long.

  There are more data messages than that, which FR24 shared on the day of the accident and which have been posted a few times in this thread. I'm pretty sure there's also been a comparison of this + previous flights posted in this thread that shows that while the coverage at the airport itself is spotty, it's reasonable to expect further messages to have been received before impact.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Not sure how permanent the content at this URL is, but here's a link to FR24's update which has a CSV with all frames received

  The comments that you are criticising are based on a subsequent release of ADS-B data from FR24 containing 113 unique messages.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While those still have the 4\xbd minute gap while the aircraft was presumably backtracking, they resume during the latter part of the takeoff roll where reception is clearly better.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There is little doubt that when they abruptly cease after the aircraft is airborne it's because the plane has stopped transmitting.

  I suggest to read this blog by Flightradar24. It does show the receiver(s) picked up signal after rotation of the aircraft.

     Please stop posting information from this commercial aircraft spotter site. It is frequently inaccurate. ADS-B site free to use and more accurate IMHO.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Data from the various flight trackers may vary in coverage or granularity, but there is no reason in this instance to believe that airborne position/altitude data published by FR24 is less accurate than that from any other flight tracker, whether commercial or not.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  What don't you believe in the published data?

          A thrust reduction is not an engine failure. Engine shutdown due to an action of crew (or inaction) is not a failure.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          There is no evidence of an electrical failure. What evidence? A surviving passenger thought he saw flickering lights? Give me a break.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          The word evidence in English has a very specific meaning.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Look for the simplest explanation here and then ask why the worldwide B787 fleet is still flying with no urgent inspection requirements from Boeing or GE. Think about that "evidence".

       thrust reduction sure sounds like engine failure to me. Neither US1549 nor Ryanair 4102 suffered flameout until the former attempted to switch the engines off and back on. I don't think anyone is going to say those weren't engine failures.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       If the aircraft had flaps deployed (the crash site photos look like it), flight controls working (no indications they weren't), and the thrust levers pushed full forwards, there is very very little that will cause it to sink other than lack of thrust.
      </div>
     </div>
     Brilliant, now what is your point? Are you suggesting a double engine failure, a roll back to idle thrust or an incorrectly set AAI causing VNAV level off and a thrust reduction. You can only choose one.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     For the team pointing to the RAT out as a failure indicator, it could have been deployed by the crew after the initial reduction in climb performance. I am not convinced it is deployed but it really does not make a convincing argument for any type of failure.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     For the children on holiday, yes I fly transport category jets, current on two types.

  In reply to you, I am solely stating that it's a thrust-side problem. I think I somewhat misinterpreted your post as it looks like you might have been saying that anyway.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In general, I think it's looking like dual engine failure/shutdown cutting electrics. I agree that
  <i>
   why
  </i>
  it occurred is very unclear. Outside chance of total electrical failure causing dual engine failure rather than the other way around, but that would perhaps be even more concerning a design failure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Similar to Jeju, we also have what is looking increasingly like a loss of ADS-B data at the moment things went wrong, not just a loss of coverage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That gives:
  <ul>
   <li>
    Sound of RAT
   </li>
   <li>
    Visible RAT
   </li>
   <li>
    (edit: APU door open implies APU autostart)
   </li>
   <li>
    Loss of ADS-B out
   </li>
   <li>
    Near-total loss of thrust.
   </li>
  </ul>
  The alternate theories seem to be a) flaps (basically discounted), b) suction feed failed after total electrical failure, or c):
  <ul>
   <li>
    A/T rolled engines back
   </li>
   <li>
    Crew interpreted this as dual engine failure
   </li>
   <li>
    Crew didn't push throttles forward
   </li>
   <li>
    Crew did switch each engine off &amp; on again and maybe deployed RAT manually as well.
   </li>
  </ul>

     Assuming GE receive data from these engines in flight, a massive failure would prompt a swift communication from GE. Or a massive electrical issue could put Boeing on edge and also prompt urgent inspections on their aircraft.

  I think it has been suggested that the upload only happens every 30 minutes or so.

     They had reached the maximum of 625 ft pressure altitude i.e 436 ft AGL. Must had been super quick in accomplishing the memory items. Just saying.😇
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I think it was 650 feet above standard pressure of 1013.
  <br/>
  Correcting for QNH 1001? gives an altitude of 290 ft approx.
  <br/>
  Less 189 ft airfield elevation gives a height AGL of 100 feet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But that was based on last ADS-B return. From the video it looks like they reached closer to 200\x92 AGL using wingspan for scale.
