     This has also been touched upon earlier in the thread, but it rather seems the cut-off switches are in the same LRU, in close proximity, using the same connector and goes through the same wiring harness. No one was able to say whether it works purely by digital signaling, and goes through any common software, or if it is duplicated by purely direct signaling. There might be numerous failure modes of the cut-off switch design, it is obviously very, very robust and overall sound, since dual failures here have never happened, but this is alredy an outlier event.

  Again, disclaimer that my direct knowledge of the 787 specifics is limited, standard Boeing design practice is that all engine wiring is segregated between engines (and were practical, between FADEC channels).
  <br/>
  The fuel switches are located adjacent to each other; however all the wiring would be separate.

     Separate would seem to be a relative term, ofcourse wires are separated in some way, but how separate? Do they share a quick connect? Are there 2 separate looms each side of the throttle installation, or are thety in some twisted bundle together. Someone on this thread claimed the fuel cut offs where inhibited if the throttles weren\x92t in idle. Is this true? If so, is this a software or mechanical system?
     <br/>
     Can anything so closely placed together be considered separate when looking at an outlier event?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Everyone is looking for something that would shut off both engines at the exact same time. This installation could, it is the closest the 2 systems get in proximity, physically and electrically, at least and it seems we don\x92t know a whole lot about it.

  Engine isolation means just that.  No common wire bundles, no common connectors.  You can move the fuel levers at any time - there is no lockout of any kind with respect to thrust lever position (imagine dropping something into the lever linkage that jams the thrust lever at max power - then being unable to shut that engine down?)
  <br/>
  Obviously, since the thrust levers are placed next to each other - the separation that's available in the center console is limited, but as soon as the wiring exits that constrained area, the separation increases.  Furthermore, the same engine-to-engine wiring separation also applies to channel A/B FADEC channels, as well as the fuel switch/fire handle wiring.
  <br/>
  All these requirements are documented in the Boeing DR&amp;O (Design Requirements and Objectives) - and there is an audit done late in the design process to insure compliance.
  <br/>
  In short, you're barking up a tree stump - there is nothing there.

  If we are to take the TCMA patent at face value, the fuel cut-off switches are directly-acting, not some sort of signalling protocol.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That's a pretty big "if" but here's the patent drawing:

  Searching the web, I found out that regulations concerning new FDR require parameter 35g "fuel cut-off lever position" to be recorded. I also found that for a 2003 event with a 757, this was recorded (as was fuel flow).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I expect that this is also true for the 787. Can anyone confirm this?
