     This has also been touched upon earlier in the thread, but it rather seems the cut-off switches are in the same LRU, in close proximity, using the same connector and goes through the same wiring harness. No one was able to say whether it works purely by digital signaling, and goes through any common software, or if it is duplicated by purely direct signaling. There might be numerous failure modes of the cut-off switch design, it is obviously very, very robust and overall sound, since dual failures here have never happened, but this is alredy an outlier event.

  If we are to take the TCMA patent at face value, the fuel cut-off switches are directly-acting, not some sort of signalling protocol.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That's a pretty big "if" but here's the patent drawing:

  Searching the web, I found out that regulations concerning new FDR require parameter 35g "fuel cut-off lever position" to be recorded. I also found that for a 2003 event with a 757, this was recorded (as was fuel flow).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I expect that this is also true for the 787. Can anyone confirm this?

  Why would spring loaded valves fail on both engines? The final valve in the GEnx Fuel Metering Unit (FMU) before the fuel flow meter and things like the fuel nozzles, is called the HPSOV and is spring loaded to closed, but fuel from the Fuel Metering Valve (FMV) can keep it open with minimal pressure (certainly enough presssure for engine start). Tank electric pumps and the engine-mounted,
  <i>
   mechanically-driven
  </i>
  two-stage pump supply fuel to the Fuel Metering Valve. During main tank pump failure, the engine mounted pump suction feeds the engine. There are altitude limitations during climb (according to the FCOM).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There are several ways that the HPSOV can close:
  <br/>
  An EEC (engine ECU) can close the upstream Fuel Metering Valve (FMV) electronically, so the HPSOV will lose its opening pressure.
  <br/>
  The HPSOV can be acted on by a Shutoff Solenoid Valve (which directs fuel pressure in an opposite manner to the pressure coming from the Fuel Metering Valve).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Unfortunately, the diagram I am using is truncated, and I can't see if the Shutoff Solenoid Valve is magnetically latched in its last commanded position like typical fuel shutoff valves. Nor can I see what controls it. I suspect things like the respective cockpit fire handle and fuel cutoff lever, but also EEC commands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There is probably a copyright on the diagram, so I won't post it here. Perhaps someone can fill in the gaps for me?

      India's Minister of State for Civil Aviation appears to be confirming in this interview that the cause of the accident was a dual engine failure. Which is, I think, the first vaguely official confirmation of what happened that has been released? He also confirmed that all the data from the recorders has been downloaded and is being processed by the Indian AAIB, no boxes have been sent abroad.
      <br/>
      The 30 day deadline for the preliminary report is July 12th.

    The minister called the crash a \x93rare case\x94 and, referring to claims by veteran pilots and experts that a dual-engine failure may have led to the crash, said: \x93It has never happened that both engines have shut down together.\x94 \x93Once the report comes, we will be able to ascertain if it was an engine problem or fuel supply issue or why both engines had stopped functioning.
   </div>
  </div>
  I think it's very important to define "engine failure" vs e.g., reduced thrust - BA38 for example was described as "restricted fuel flow when thrust was demanded" and there was no evidence of engine driven generator power stopping as the engines were still running at idle at impact. It's pretty clear from the available evidence that Air India lost electrical power within 20 seconds of leaving the ground, and based on the landing gear orientation theories that time may be significantly shorter &lt;10 seconds.

     It would go against every aspect of training for a professional crew to deploy the rat below 400 feet. Further if you put 100 crewmembers in a simulator on takeoff and said deploy the rat manually I would bet not a single crew member could find the rat deploy switch and activate it in under 5 seconds and maybe 2 or 3 in 10 seconds.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Yes, but The RAT doesn't have to be deployed manually.
  <br/>
  It can auto-deploy in a significant electrical failure.
  <br/>
  The theory I'm working is that, given the configuration of the aircraft, if there is a significant electrical failure (sufficient for the RAT to auto-deploy). The aircraft fuel pumps are lost. Approx. 7ish seconds after those fuel pumps are lost (if the engines are at TOGA), the fuel being received by the engines is arriving from a different source, a potentially contaminated source. I believe that the engine failure is a secondary result of the power loss (with specific circumstances).
  <br/>
  But this all hinges on whether the engines were trying to run, or commanded off. Hence the request for interpretation of the sound.

  It isn't that your suppositions are necessarily bad ones, but that they seem a bit of a stretch. Of course I'm no expert, hence asking.

     OK - Fair Challenges - good post, I'll have a go at answering and simultaneously expanding my own thoughts. In fact I'm not having a go at you, I'm more working my theory....
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Experience. Without wishing to dox myself, I've worked in engineering at a major airline from apprentice through (in no particular order) Line Maintenance, Heavy and Light Maintenance, to technical support and maintenance control on both Boeing and Airbus products, with various qualifications and authorisations along the way. [Hmm - Scrap this sentence?]On the day 9/11 occurred, I should have been making modifications inside a fuel tank instead of staring at the TV with mouth on the floor.
     <br/>
     However, I would describe my experience as broad, yet shallow in respect to this incident. Some of my fleet I know every rivet. Some of my fleet I've only ever seen from a distance. I don't touch airplanes for a living any more. B787 though - is not my area of specialty. I'll dig in, but am not the expert. I am not a systems design engineer, so precise numbers and flow rates, are not what I do. But what the systems do, how they operate, what they look like, smell and taste like... yeah, I'm not a muggle. And I do have access to all the manuals and know how to use them. And - let me be clear, I am speculating. I was advancing a theory. It WILL be some flavour of wrong. The investigation will reveal all.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I Agree, Water in fuel is not a novel concept. Aircraft fuel tanks attract water - fact. How much? It varies. I've sumped tanks and got no water, I've seen drops of water beading about in the bottom of a gallon jug, I've seen gallons of water. I've been so covered in fuel I cant smell it or think straight and taken gallon after gallon not being able to tell if its fuel or water. I also agree that 57% humidity doesn't seem particularly high - its not south east Asian jungle levels - but I'm not an expert at humidity, 32Deg c at 57% humidity at 02:30 am is not going to be comfortable for me though. I looked at recent weather in DEL, and those values were at the higher end of the range.
     <br/>
     Further, I believe the prevailing weather conditions on the ground are less important when it comes to the volume of water getting in. Fuel is cold, or gets damn cold during a 9 Hr flight. Fuel Temperature Management is an issue for our Drivers. So as the fuel is used at altitude, Air enters the tank through NACA Ducts in the outboard end of the wing. Its beneficial to maintain a slight positive pressure, amongst other things to reduce evaporation. (Added complication, there is also the Nitrogen Enrichment system due to TWA800 - but that's more about processing the air in the tank to change the properties and make it non-explosive). Then as the aircraft descends, more air enters as the air pressure increases. Its the humidity of that air in the descent that is going to determine the volume of water entering the tank and potentially the fuel. The water in the air condenses on the sides of the tank because of the cold post-flight fuel. It doesn't dissolve into the fuel, but sinks to the bottom. Ground temperature / humidity and time will likely affect how much water condenses out of that air while on the ground. There won't be a huge amount of air exchange on the ground. Likely if the AC landed at 2am, then from sunrise as the tank warmed up, there would actually be a flow out of the vents.
     <br/>

     What Features and procedures are there to mitigate Water? I apologise if my post gave the impression that there are no mitigation processes. There are. Water is well understood in the industry.
     <br/>
     Well for a start, Features / Design. The Aircraft has a water scavenge system. Water doesn't mix with fuel, it sinks to the bottom being about 20% denser than fuel, so at the very lowest point in the tank, the water scavenge system (Powered by the Aft Fuel Pump through a jet pump, a venturi like system) will suck up the 'fluid' at the very lowest point, where the water would collect and in Boeings words 'drip' that fluid into the path of the pump pickup inlet (but I'd describe it more as a 'squirt'). The idea being that a small amount of water injected into the fuel will be consumed by the engines harmlessly.
     <br/>
     There is also agitation. The wing tank pumps are pretty much running constantly, from before engine startup to after engine shutdown. The pumps are quite violent to the fuel and supply more pressure then the engine could ever need. Any excess pressure is dumped right back into the tank, quite close to the pump, in a direction that would further stir up the fuel and help break up any water into suspended droplets.
     <br/>
     This all works if there is a small amount of water in the fuel. The water scavenge pickup is right next to the pump inlet, but a bit lower. Little bits of water get managed. Looking at the pictures of the system, I'd say a couple of gallons of water would do no harm at all.
     <br/>
     But if there was significantly more water in that tank. Guessing 10-30 + gallons, then the pump would be circulating water, or highly water rich fuel.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Then there's the suction pickup. Its in the same 'bay' as the aft fuel pump and located a little 'higher' than the pump inlet and water scavenge inlet. But also located between stringers that can separate out the settled water ( I wish I could share the pictures, but more than my job is worth ) I can imagine the suction pickup being in a pool of 'stagnant' water.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I also saw a post from Metcha about the scavenge system blocking with Algae - I don't know about that (B787 not my fleet). But possible that could aggravate things. There's also the reports of the Indian AAIB looking at the Titan Biocide incident. Its possible that might be related and could modify the theory.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Procedures - There's the (at my airline weekly I think) procedure to 'sump' the tanks. There are drain points in the tank. Valves that you can push in with a tool and fluid drains. As described earlier (and videos exist on YouTube), you drain about a gallon of fluid and examine it for water. Most often in temperate climates (my experience), there's a few 'beads' of water in the bottom of the jug, moving about like mercury. Except when there's more. Sometimes there's a clear line in the jug, half water, fuel above. And sometimes a gallon of water, that smells like fuel. You drain it until you are sure there's no water.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Could 'that much' water have condensed in the tank? Well - There's the question. I guess the basis of the theory is that on descent into DEL, the wing tanks picked up some very humid air, which settled water into the tanks through the night. Then, as the theory I posited must work, the wing pumps must have circulated and suspended that water into the fuel.
     <br/>
     By design, the water from the CDG-DEL arrival should have been consumed in the DEL-AMD Sector. But desperately clinging to defending my theory (I appreciate this is a hole), lets assume that at DEL the pumps were running for a long time. Lets assume that the pumps allowed the water to be dispersed within the tank prior to being used through the engines. Then - in the DEL-AMD sector, the wing tanks could have picked up more water.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     How much water would cause a sustained flameout? I never posited a sustained flameout. I posited a significant reduction in thrust. Listening back to the rooftop video, which at first we were all listening for evidence of RAT, there's also a rhythmic pop-pop-pop of engines struggling. I think the engines were running, albeit badly. Heavily water contaminated fuel will do that. It doesn't have to be 100% water. Just enough water to make the engine lose thrust. Your 2 gallons per second figure assumes the engine running at full flow. I'm not a figures man, I'll not challenge that, I do recall flowmeters at max thrust spin like crazy. But an engine struggling due to a high perrcentage of contamination, is that using 2 gal/sec? or just trying to? What happens if there is e.g. 20% water in the fuel?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     There are also reported incidents of engine flameout / thrust reduction that have all happened at altitude. Incidents that have been recovered due to the altitude and time available. I Posited that the engines would have eventually regained full thrust once the contamination worked though. But 30 seconds of rough engine is very different at 40,000 feet than it is at 100 feet.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The theory also relies on a second part - the electrical failure. That the electrical failure causes the fuel supply to switch, a few seconds after the failure. We go, at the point of electrical failure from a pumped centre tank supply to a sucked wing tank supply. It takes time for that different fuel to reach the engine.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Ive written enough and am tired. Must stop now.

  There's an awful lot of ifs and buts in that opus.
  <br/>
  A water spillage from a galley or lavatory would have to be huge to cause the type of total electrical failure you describe. The Power Electrics panels are yards apart, for both main systems to fail simultaneously due to water ingress would take gallons and gallons of water. Sorry but I don't buy it!
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Do they still use Bowsers in India? I thought most airports used underground pipes feeding pots on the stands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Re: settled fuel.  As soon as the boost pumps are running, fuel is being recirculated.  When we do water drain checks we have to leave the aircraft for a good hour after any refuelling, boost pump operation or aircraft movement before taking the samples. Otherwise any water will remain suspended in the fuel.
  <br/>
  Generally speaking flight deck preparation that I have witnessed will have the boost pumps on many many minutes before take off. This will agitate the fuel and any contamination sufficiently to render your theory moot .
  <br/>
  I'm also not quite sure how the aircraft could have got so much contaminated fuel on the previous sector and it not be scavenged out during that flight.

  It would be good to get an FCOM reference for this, and/or definitive answer from a current 787 pilot (if they know
  <img alt="" border="0" class="inlineimg" src="https://www.pprune.org/images/smilies2/eusa_silenced.gif" title="Oh"/>
  ).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the A320 if the centre fuel pumps are selected on pre-start, they run for 2 mins after start and then turn
  <i>
   themselves
  </i>
  off until Flaps selected to 0 (i.e. well after takeoff), when they turn
  <i>
   themselves
  </i>
  on. As far as the crew are concerned they were
  <i>
   selected
  </i>
  on from pre-start onwards [long retired A320 so forgive me if in error].

  <br/>
  If certification demands this 'complexity' it would seem surprising the 787 does not have a similar system? Are we sure the 787 centre tank 'higher pressure' pumps are:

  I'm afraid not, take off and landing are considered high risk as far as fuel supply is concerned and the following FAR is relevant,

     Perhaps a result of being too dense, in these threads I have not understood whatsoever the discussions on L/D, best glide, AOA, stall speed, angles, whatever, as being relevant to this flight. I assume that the pilot flying was flying, i.e. stick and rudder. I give him/her the benefit of the doubt on account of being a pilot. Professional or not.

  Quite. If all we had to go on was the position of the crash site it might have made sense but we have video and audio of pretty much the whole thing, plus a bit of ADSB. You could almost say that we now know how far a 787 will go when it loses all useful thrust just after rotation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The real question is why this happened when engines and their associated systems are, by design and regulation, as independent as possible. The top runners at the moment are (in no particular order): pilot action, simultaneous hardware/software malfunction and massive fuel contamination. They are all very unlikely (and cogent technical arguments can be made against each of them) but so is the event that followed.

     , I didn't say they did, I said centre tanks were typically turned on at that altitude (using a certain 737 operator as a guide). As the check list that you posted shows the centre pumps will automatically turn off because of load shedding once an engine is started.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  The pumps are load shed
  <i>
   during
  </i>
  (and possibly before) engine start. Available power is presumably somewhat limited when on APU only (two generators not four) and especially when you're electrically cranking the engines. When on ground and with engines stopped, aircon, IFE, and galley probably takes priority over pumping fuel to nowhere.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Once both engines are running and the four VFSGs are online, I would not expect any load shedding and certainly not of flight loads like fuel pumps.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Airbus manuals imply or clearly state that centre pumps are inhibited when the flaps are extended, so both engines draw from the wing/main tanks. I haven't seen anything clearly matching in the Boeing manuals.

  We know (from the 248-day bug) that full AC power failure is possible and we see from the RAT and landing gear orientation that full AC power failure was likely within ~10 seconds of leaving the ground.

  I also don't see any evidence that engine driven fuel pumps alone must be able to handle this scenario: provide enough fuel flow for takeoff and climb, even while the pitch is rotating, even in a hot environment with significant weight, even while the gear is stuck down.

  <br/>
  I know that the engine driven pumps have documented limitations and that the regulations allow for some limitations. I know that at least one of these limitation is high altitude and I _suspect_ that the design intends for this unlikely scenario (engine driven fuel pumps alone with no AC pumps) to guarantee enough fuel flow to get to an airport and land. I also suspect that the APU is expected to solve loss of all AC generators - and as we know, there wasn't enough time for it to start in this scenario.

     We know (from the 248-day bug) that full AC power failure is possible and we see from the RAT and landing gear orientation that full AC power failure was likely within ~10 seconds of leaving the ground.

  I believe that particular bug is fixed, though it's always possible there's other issues causing a total AC loss.

       I also don't see any evidence that engine driven fuel pumps alone must be able to handle this scenario: provide enough fuel flow for takeoff and climb, even while the pitch is rotating, even in a hot environment with significant weight, even while the gear is stuck down.
       <br>
        <br>
         I know that the engine driven pumps have documented limitations and that the regulations allow for some limitations. I know that at least one of these limitation is high altitude and I _suspect_ that the design intends for this unlikely scenario (engine driven fuel pumps alone with no AC pumps) to guarantee enough fuel flow to get to an airport and land. I also suspect that the APU is expected to solve loss of all AC generators - and as we know, there wasn't enough time for it to start in this scenario.

     The aircraft has two engines and should be able to climb out on one, plus it dropped like a
     <i>
      rock
     </i>
     . 'Significantly degraded' thrust isn't really compatible with what we saw. You'd also expect the engines to recover pretty quickly as it leveled off.
     <br>
      <br>
       The limitations at high altitude are primarily air/volatiles degassing out of the fuel. That's not going to be much of an issue at sea level, even if the engines are a bit higher up during rotation.
       <br>
        APU is a nice-to-have; it's on the MEL. If you lose all four generators, it's because of some major carnage in the electrical software/hardware and chances of putting the APU on line even if it's operating are very slim.

     I have an up to date B787-9 FCOM and it agrees with Bloggs. Centre tank pumps are switched on prior to start. Load shedding is just until all electrics are available, ie until after engine start, then the centre tank pumps are operational as far as I can tell.
     <br/>
     <br/>

  It's exactly the same on the B777 - the centre fuel pump switches go on before start if the FUEL IN CENTER EICAS message is displayed.  The switches go off again when the FUEL LOW CENTER message is displayed.  On the ground, the B777 needs two power sources for both centre tank pumps to operate, so one pump is normally shed until after engine start.   The centre tank pumps output about three times the pressure of the main tank pumps.  Fuel is fed from the centre tank until the centre tank pumps are selected off.

  Sorry, you missed the point I was trying to make. \xa7 25.903(b) does say that the fuel system
  <b>
   must
  </b>
  <i>
   be able to operate
  </i>
  in an isolated, two-sided mode (for a twin engined jet), such that nothing on one side, such as bad fuel, will adversely affect the other engine. Of course, during Takeoff, both sides drawing fuel from a Centre Tank containing a lot of contaminants (e.g. Fuel Bug matter, water) is a scenario that could bring down the plane. We are all aware of that. But the point I was trying to make is that although \xa7 25.903(b) requires "at least one configuration" that separates both systems entirely (such as Left engine drawing from Left Main Tank, and Right from Right) which
  <b>
   <i>
    can
   </i>
  </b>
  be configured, the Rule doesn't appear to make that compulsory for Takeoff.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A lot of other posters here have stated that according to FCOM instructions, the normal, accepted 787 Takeoff configuration is "Both sides draw from centre" if the Centre tanks have enough fuel in them. I think (maybe wrongly) that this (prior few posts) is the first time this exact point has been raised. I hope I'm correct there. If not, my humble apologies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The great thing about this forum and sadly, this tragic accident, is that it's drawing a few previously little-known worms out of the woodwork.

     May I ask where this information of load shedding comes from please
     <br/>
     In my experience the APU supplies enough power to run all systems. Hydraulic pumps, fuel pumps etc
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  On the 767, 757 and A330 anytime you are in single generator operations the aircraft is load shedding. The 787 with a totally different electrical system might function differently.

  As an electronics and software engineer who has read the AD and related materials on the 248 day bug my understanding is that:
  <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
   <li>
    The specific 248-day integer overflow was patched, and before the fix was rolled out, the AD required this system to by power cycled every 120 days to prevent overflow
   </li>
   <li>
    The PCU software still has the
    <i>
     functional requirement
    </i>
    to be able to command all AC GCUs to enter failsafe mode, this means that while the initial bug was fixed, the ability for this particular software system to command the same result is still a functional part of the architecture - presumably for safety management of the AC system
   </li>
   <li>
    This was not the first or last "software overflow error" issue in Boeing or even in the 787
   </li>
  </ol>
  Although I'm not qualified in aviation engineering I do believe from an engineering safety standpoint that this architecture creates a rare but entirely feasible scenario in which the aircraft would be without AC power for at least 30 seconds until the APU could restore it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I do agree that the engine driven pumps
  <i>
   should
  </i>
  be able to provide fuel alone, the whole point of these pumps is to keep the plane flying within
  <i>
   some
  </i>
  limitations, high altitude is one of those limitations, I propose that there may be others based on the following:
  <ul>
   <li>
    Some more knowledgable people here have proposed or countered vapour lock, fuel contamination and automatic fuel cut-off theories to various degrees - even if these are not enough on their own, loss of electrical during rotation at high temperature could combine with these in a way we have not yet considered
   </li>
   <li>
    Thrust is nonlinear, and while I'm not qualified to say how much loss of fuel flow or loss of thrust would be critical in this scenario we do know that it was a hot takeoff with significant weight and gear remaining down - I know others here have run sims but I don't think anyone has focused on specific thrust / fuel flow params
   </li>
   <li>
    While electric fuel pumps might not be physically necessary for takeoff, my final point is: why are they
    <i>
     required
    </i>
    for takeoff? Is it not to mitigate cavitation, fuel sloshing at rotation, or any other kind of problem that might be relevant here?
   </li>
  </ul>
