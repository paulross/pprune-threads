  I am puzzled by the TCMA logic, as shown on the patent, which of course could have nothing to do with final design, but clearly in my understanding the two FADEC channels are acting in series, therefore by design they do not need to concur to shut down the engine. Am I wrong?

  That is correct, at least if the designed and implemented system did what the patent application said it would do.

  Yet the (a?) patent application for the TCMA addition to the EEC was filed by Boeing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I guess we'll eventually find out what bits were actually connected to the engines fitted to the accident aircraft, by whom and when.

  That sounds right, since it's an airframe related issue, not specific to the engine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Your other implied question, ie: Is the TCMA software part of the FADEC , or something Boeing designed and built. Or, where is that functionality resident in the system, and who designed and built it ?. Starting to think that this tragedy may have had a far more subtle cause than has been imagined thus far.

  Boeing's patent application says:

    In this preferred embodiment, TCMA circuit 16 is included in an electronic engine control (EEC) 18 that is mounted on an aircraft engine.

  My understanding is that "EEC" is Boeing for "FADEC".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But I have to reiterate, and as others have noted, that we don't know what actual TCMA systems, if any, were fitted where and how it was wired into the accident aircraft's engines, or whether the specific state of the TCMA systems, if any, were monitored by the flight recorders.

  I (and I think everyone else here) have been assuming that the FADEC does in fact have a dedicated permanent-magnet alternator, as is the case on the Airbuses (confirmed by FCOM) and surely the 737.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I have been told elsewhere that this is not the case. A read of the draft FCOM available online for the 777 &amp; 787 makes no mention of a FADEC generator, but then neither does the 737 manuals. Is this simply a case of "Boeing thinks you don't need to know"?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It has been proposed that the primary source of power for the FADECs is actually the flight control PMGs, mounted on the engine gearbox, but that this power goes to the avionics bay, has failover switching gear, and comes back to the EEC.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Can anyone shed concrete light on this (e.g. a source that clearly states there is both an EEC alternator and a flight control PMG on the accessory gearbox)?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alternator and generator seem to be used interchangeably in this context.

  Unfortunately, it is only a list of parameters that they used and verified in the investigation - the only ones listed for the engines are N1 and cutoff switch. Other accident/incident FDR reports might be more focused on engines and include a similar table.

  I don't think you'll find an actual wire list for it (or it won't be useful) as apparently most/all of the data is via an ARINC bus.

  confirmed the PMGs for the FADECs in the first AI171 thread. He even explained the logic behind it and the connections with the onboard electronics:
  <br/>
  - Each engine has a PMG for the FADECs
  <br/>
  - Only for engine start the FADECs are powered by the aircraft
  <br/>
  - Once the engines are running, this connection is opened
  <br/>
  - It is verified, that the FADECs are then no longer connected to the aircraft electrical system. A failure to open the connection triggers a "No dispatch" message
  <br/>
  - In case the PMG fails, the FADECs are once again powered by the aircraft electrical system

     confirmed the PMGs for the FADECs in the first AI171 thread. He even explained the logic behind it and the connections with the onboard electronics:
     <br/>
     - Each engine has a PMG for the FADECs
     <br/>
     - Only for engine start the FADECs are powered by the aircraft
     <br/>
     - Once the engines are running, this connection is opened
     <br/>
     - It is verified, that the FADECs are then no longer connected to the aircraft electrical system. A failure to open the connection triggers a "No dispatch" message
     <br/>
     - In case the PMG fails, the FADECs are once again powered by the aircraft electrical system
    </div>

  Yes. That is what I have read here, that is my assumption, that is how Airbus does it,
  <i>
   that is what makes sense

  .
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But I am being told elsewhere by someone with an A&amp;P badge that that is not quite the whole story, and that the FADEC PMGs do double-duty as the flight control PMGs.
  <br/>

  I am hoping for some documentation to confirm/refute that.

  Is that likely ?. The whole point of the PMG must be to ensure hermeticity of operation of the FADEC, when all else fails. That becomes compromised if the PMG also has a FADEC external load placed on it.

     There\x92s at least N2 overspeed protection that actually uses the same hardware as TCMA to stop the noise. There might exists crosstalk and inhibit for the N2 overspeed protection if the N2 overspeed protection has shut down the other engine. In fact it\x92s not confirmed that no such crosstalk exists in 787 TCMA system. It would complie with \x94no single fault should cause\x85\x94 certification requirements. Other than that I see no practical difference in the propability of TCMA and N2 overspeed protection to shut down both engine during take-off.

  That is how it's done on the EC-135 helicopter (also FADEC controlled). One failed engine will disable the overspeed protection for the remaining engine. Of course a helicopter is a whole different story, though.

     We have two donks individual fuel supply cut simultaneous in split seconds. There is no rudder activity visible for any thrust asymmetry during this timeframe. TCMA is implemented via the FADECs which are independent for each engine with their own power source from each engine. TCMA is designed to shut down its engine if its power lever is in retard position and the engine is still powering with too much thrust. In addition the airplanes ground sensors must indicate that it is on the ground. For each thrust leaver there are two independent position sensors. It is similar redundant designed as in modern car acceleration pedals. A dual redundancy in each thrust leaver. For TCMA to shut down two fuel supplies within split seconds we have to assume that 4 thrust leaver sensors malfunctioned and the ground sensing logic failed at the same time. The probability that this happens is nil (may be 1 in every 10exp15 hours) which would be about 10 times the age of our universe.
     <br/>
     Unless there is a software error in the FADEC TCMA system which only came to light on this flight. But there seem to be nothing special on this flight until rotation. If there is a software error I expect, that we get false single engine shut downs first. And that would already made the news if it happened during rotation.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Actually, according to
  <a href="https://www.pprune.org/members/414340-tdracer" rel="nofollow">
   tdracer
  </a>
  , each channel of the FADEC gets just one throttle resolver input, as the two resolvers are on separate wiring looms. So, the FADEC is using the dual channel feature to handle erroneous throttle position inputs. However, according to the patent at least, each channel can trigger TCMA and cut the fuel supply independently. So now we're down to only needing only one erroneous throttle signal per engine. Or one wrong interpretation of a signal, e.g. value clipping where you shouldn't (shortcircuit -&gt; idle), some integer overflow etc.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  So, from my understanding, if there is an issue with some of the throttle position sensors, the FADECs will detect a disagreement and keep the high thrust -&gt; assume safe is "fly", whereas one of the TCMA channels might read or misinterpret throttle position close to idle. As the thrust doesn't decrease, at some point the upper bound of the falling TCMA thrust contour will be breached and the engine will be shut down.

     Based on my previous speculation regarding a BTB short, I wonder how aircraft engines might react in a situation where initially a transient power fault is followed by only battery power being available? As I understand it, there are no longer cable connections to the engines, given no valid inputs from the.thrust levers, what thrust mode would the FADEC's revert to?
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Battery power should still result in a controllable aircraft and controllable thrust.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thrust lever resolvers are powered by the FADECs, so as long as the engine remains running, it will know what requested thrust is from the pilots. You presumably loss A/T.

  I certainly expect and hope so. But I can't find any 787 or even 777 documentation confirming it.

     ...the FADEC PMGs do double-duty as the flight control PMGs.

  On the B777, each EEC is powered by a dedicated control alternator whenever the engines are running. The control alternators are mounted on the forward side of the main gearbox of each engine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The flight controls power supply assemblies (PSA) have several sources of power, including PMGs located within the backup generators.

  <br/>
  The EEC control alternators do

  perform double duty by powering the flight control system PSAs. I can't imagine the B787 being much different.

 <div id="post_message_11905939">
  Does a Boeing 787 go from HOLD TO/GA to THR REF/VNAV SPD at 400' AGL/AAE, like older versions of the Boeing?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If so, what if the WoW stayed in ground mode, for whatever reason, how would that affect
  <br/>
  <br/>
  1) Retraction of the landing gear (it didn't retract, as obvious in videos released)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  2) The transition from HOLD to THR/REF at 400' (they reached just barely over 400' AGL before leveling, then descending)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I am also thinking that Air India would follow Boeing procedures in that the left seat pilot will move their right hand away from the thrust levers at V1, and thus, at 400', the thrust levers are not guarded or monitored?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Even if thrust levers were pushed forward, is there some kind of logic related to FMC and-or FADEC or other involved systems, which regardless of thrust lever position commands IDLE thrust to the engine?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Remember that Airbus accident where the aircraft thought it was landing, while the pilots wanted full thrust, and they crashed into a small forest because some kind of idle is all they were afforded by the system?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If the engines of this 787 thought it was in the rollout or final part of the flare, it might also command thrust levers to idle?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This does not explain the RAT, though, unless there is some weird combination of software working against each others logic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <span style="color:#000000">
   Had the engines failed by some really random, odd reason, like birds, fuel contamination-vapor-starvation or such, wouldn't there be at least a slight bit of roll or yaw visible? Even with TAC or whatever they have on the 787, I would think even a 1 second difference in thrust reduction between the engines, a hint of yaw or roll should be visible ...
  </span>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thoughts, especially by someone who flies the 787?
