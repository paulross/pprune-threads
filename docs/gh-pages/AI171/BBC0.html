  BBC reporting a statement from the survivor, "a load bang was heard just after take off and the aircraft crashed soon after".

  Has there been any word about the state of the approach lights at the end of this runway?

   BBC: British passenger in seat 11A survives India plane crash, reports says
  </a>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "
  <i>
   A man survived the Air India crash that killed at least 200 people, a police chief has told an Indian news agency.
  </i>
  <i>
   Ahmedabad Police Commissioner GS Malik told ANI there was one survivor who was in seat 11A on the London-bound Boeing 787-8 flight - a seat the flight manifest shared by authorities said was British national Vishwashkumar Ramesh.
  </i>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <i>
   His cousin in Leicester, Ajay Valgi, told the BBC that Mr Ramesh called his family to say he was "fine" but he does not know the whereabouts of his brother, Ajay who was also on the plane.
  </i>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <i>
   Video shared on social media showed Mr Ramesh walking towards an ambulance, with smoke billowing in the background.
  </i>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <i>
   Indian media said Mr Ramesh shared his boarding pass, which showed his name and seat number.
  </i>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <i>
   He has a wife and child. The BBC understands he was born in India, but has lived in the UK for many years."

  Not going to get drawn on possible reasons for this crash (that's for investigators), but I would encourage you to make a complaint to the BBC regarding the fact that the BBC News reporters trespassed onto the crash site and probably contaminated it. Their reporter was up-front in admitting that they explored it before the police kicked them out. And even more fundamentally, if they weren't helping with the rescue then they were getting in the way of emergency responders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Regardless of whether or not the cause is clear cut or not, they should know better than to go trampling around a crash site when they could easily film from the edges. Normally I'm very happy with BBC News as a source of information but this was unacceptable, in my opinion.

  While I agree with the cause for complaint, having seen some of those videos from the immediate aftermath (and generally recommending you don't go looking for them unless you want to see the charred remains of people being moved), it was crowded with many civilians all over the crash site trying to help. I'd suggest a better complaint may be to Indian authorities who should perhaps have secured the scene a lot faster.

  No expert, but watching BBC yesterday I had my doubts about how the whole crash site was being managed and secured. Excavators digging through the wreckage, dozens of random looking people picking through debris, bags and the likes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Surely there are massive risks with regards to theft and contamination of the site, damage to evidence etc.

  The same BBC report also says the people in nearby buildings who ran to help were alerted by a huge bang outside that they initially thought might be thunder - not by a plane's engines rapidly getting louder and louder only metres away.

     BBC reports the wreckage was spread over 200m.

     I am utterly unqualified to comment, but I don't believe it has been mentioned so far on the thread.

  Given that 60 m of those 200 was taken up by the length of the aircraft, stopping an airliner flying at significant speed in the remaining 140m shows just how sudden and dramatic the deceleration was during the crash.  Were you trying to imply that 200m was a long trail of wreckage?

     I have tried a couple of times but it keeps getting removed as some sort of "AI construct" by the moderators.

     This is a screen shot taken from the Video thats posted on the BBC Verify website, that they have verified as authentic.

     I still can't see a RAT deployed.

  Given the quality of the video you cannot see that the RAT is NOT deployed either

  The assumption that engines were producing thrust because noise was heard isn't warranted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Studies show that for aircraft landing with engines at landing thrust, 30 - 50% of the noise generated is from the landing gear and flaps down, so if the aircraft here had engines at low thrust setting, as appears to be the case, then the sound heard approaching could have been in large part due to the landing gear and flaps, which were down.
