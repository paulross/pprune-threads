  I (and I think everyone else here) have been assuming that the FADEC does in fact have a dedicated permanent-magnet alternator, as is the case on the Airbuses (confirmed by FCOM) and surely the 737.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I have been told elsewhere that this is not the case. A read of the draft FCOM available online for the 777 &amp; 787 makes no mention of a FADEC generator, but then neither does the 737 manuals. Is this simply a case of "Boeing thinks you don't need to know"?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It has been proposed that the primary source of power for the FADECs is actually the flight control PMGs, mounted on the engine gearbox, but that this power goes to the avionics bay, has failover switching gear, and comes back to the EEC.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Can anyone shed concrete light on this (e.g. a source that clearly states there is both an EEC alternator and a flight control PMG on the accessory gearbox)?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alternator and generator seem to be used interchangeably in this context.

     This isn&rsquo;t the first one either. On February 9, 2024 a Challenger 600 manuevering to final at Naples FL, (APF) lost both engines simultaneously and crashed on a highway short of the runway. The NTSB final report isn&rsquo;t out yet so we don&rsquo;t know that cause either, but the situation was the same. SOMEhow, a highly experienced crew found themselves in a situation from which there was apparently no escape. Whatever the cause was, how did it go un-detected until it produced an accident? (It&rsquo;s NTSB accident number ERA24FA110. You can find that thread on PPRUNE by searching on Challenger 600. The preliminary NTSB report contains interesting readouts from the FDR. Yes, they lost both fans simultaneously.) I&rsquo;m not suggesting these two accidents have related causes, I&rsquo;m only observing that both crews apparently had no way out.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     My condolences to all who were lost. Please keep in mind that except by the grace of God it could have been any one of us on that terrible day.

  I didn't read that thread, but having flown the aircraft (challenger 600 type), I believe the consensus is that the Captain reaching underneath the thrust levers to actuate the flaps can (and has) resulted in the "triggers" on the back of the thrust levers being engaged- if this is done while the FO is bringing the thrust to idle, it can result in going below the idle stop to cutoff. In other words, the engines were inadvertently shut down.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But I agree that the complete, simultaneous loss of thrust on both engines has to be an astronomical probability, and the cause is going to be interesting to say the least.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I also agree that any one of us could be put in a horrible position within seconds that would be very hard to recover from- the older I get and the more hours I spend in the air, this starts to spend more time in one's consciousness, unfortunately.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  BTW calling the crew " highly experienced" is a bit of a stretch IMO, the Captain certainly was, but 1100 hours isn't even enough for an ATP in most countries. For all we know it was not a factor, of course.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  PS, what is an SLF??

  Consensus here is, that both engines where stopped by a closing fuel cut off valve, wich yields a fast loss of N2. The generators  then shut down very quick as does the thrust in a few seconds. This is supported by the quick RAT extension which allowed the crew to control the flight. The APU did autostart too. A thrust changed with the thrust leaver to idle is much slower and would not result in the dramatic change in performance. Thrust set to idle will not engage the RAT since the electric generators would still work. So a thrust leaver  changed to idle or any intervention by Autothrust (AT) would not yield to the RAT extension. Something or someone activated a fuel cut off. How and why that happened is the big question, the investigators have to answer.

  A naive glider pilot question: if fuel cut off was (inconceivably) selected, would both fuel control levers have been flipped downwards from Run to Cutoff? And if they were then immediately flipped back to the Run position, how much time would have been needed to achieve enough thrust to maintain altitude?

  The 787-8 landing gear retraction is primarily hydraulic, using the center hydraulic system for the main operation. However, the alternate gear
  <i>
   <u>
    extension
   </u>
  </i>
  system utilizes a dedicated electric pump to pressurize fluid from the center hydraulic system for gear extension. Obviously due its size and weight and staged retraction, the effort required to raise and stow the gear greatly exceeds that required for extension.
  <br>
   <br>
    The main gear retraction/extension is controlled by the center hydraulic system.
    <br>
     <br>
      It is apparent that the hydraulics failed when the engines shut down after breaking the down-locks and leaving the Main Landing gear bogeys in the tilt position, ready for a
      <b>
       <i>
        next step
       </i>
      </b>
      internal stowage and door closure (that was now never to happen). It is therefore apparent that the dual engine failure and consequent automated RAT extension was precipitated by this gear selection or retraction cycle and thus likely to be either WoW micro-switch or 5G Radar altimeter-effect associated. Due to accumulator depletion, the electric pump load would have spiked to replenish it. This may have precipitated the dual engine shutdown due to an unfiltered electrical surge affecting the Ground/Air microswitches (or a local 5G transmission affecting the RADALT) and resetting the TCMA.
      <br>
       <br>
        The RADALT? Another plausibility? Because of the furore over a spasticated frequency allocation by the US FCC, the US FAA had finally &ldquo;bought in&rdquo; and declared that individual nations and their airline operators were responsible for their own 5G frequency spectrum allocations and for taking essential steps to ensure mitigation of the interference effects upon aircraft automated landings and other
        <i>
         critical systems

        caused by their own national approved 5G spectrum decisions. It was admittedly a situation calling for extensive modifications to (and shielding for) the three radar altimeters fitted for redundancy considerations to all modern airliners... for Category 3 ILS approach and landing in zero/zero visibility conditions.  The RADALT also features in many air-ground sensing applications. (eg the 747-8).
        <br>
         <br/>
         This was an unusual FAA
         <i>
          &ldquo;passing of the buck&rdquo;
         </i>
         to manufacturers such as Honeywell etc. (to sort out with client operators). But then again, it was not the US FCC&rsquo;s right to dictate the specific 5G frequencies internationally. These spectrum allocations now vary over the wide selection of 5G phones available (and also nationally). 5G Radar Altimeters constitute a part of the ground/Air sensing that changes the TCMA from ground mode (able to fuel-chop engines) to the air mode (inhibited from doing so)... Ground activation is acceptable ...where fuel chopping of uncommanded thrust can prevent runway sideways excursions or runway length overruns. The question now becomes: &ldquo;Is it more (or less) safe having an automated fuel-chopping capability on BOTH your left and right, rather than leaving it to the pilot to react via his center console fuel cut-off switches... in the unlikely event of a runaway engine after landing (or during an abandoned take-off)?

         <b>
          5G Frequency Variations
         </b>
         <br/>
         <br/>
         The frequencies of 5G phones vary nationally based on the frequency bands allocated and used by different carriers in each country. In the United States, for example, carriers such as AT&amp;T, Verizon, T-Mobile, and others use a combination of low-band, mid-band, and high-band 5G frequencies.
         <b>
          Low-band 5G frequencies typically range from 600 MHz to 1 GHz, mid-band 5G frequencies range from 1.7 GHz to 2.5 GHz, and high-band 5G (mmWave) frequencies start at 24 GHz and go up to 40 GHz
         </b>
         . These frequencies are allocated by regulatory bodies such as the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and can vary between countries based on spectrum availability and regulatory decisions. In other countries, the specific frequency bands used for 5G may differ, leading to variations in the frequencies supported by 5G phones. Additionally, the deployment of 5G networks can also influence the frequencies used, with some countries focusing more on sub-6 GHz bands while others prioritize mmWave technology.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         5G interference? It may be an avenue worth exploring?

  Agree. The two most important controls in the aeroplane, sitting there in a wide-open, unprotected space. After an incident where a manual fell off the coaming (can't remember if a switch got bashed into the Off position), we put guards on our non-787 fuel switches:

  Yes, and probably much to @Roo's disgust, we had an instance where an engine shut down all by itself in the cruise; it was concluded that the fuel switch hadn't been "locked" in the ON position and was just sitting on the edge. It was then highlighted to all of us that the FCOM stated "give it a good jiggle" to make doubly sure it was locked in ON.

     They comply with a military standard that requires 40,000 cycles though the locking part is tested 20,000 times by just pulling to its full extent. Or something like that. How well that testing matches real world use is debatable.

  This isn\xb4t quite right. They could both have had a malfunction without this being an issue until something or someone hit them at the same time (e.g. on rotation). It\xb4s just another theory which isn\xb4t less plausible than many others.

  Obviously. If yours is the switch I think it is (with the metal, unscrewable dome) then yes, it is very different. Very hard to "balance" yours in the middle.
  <br/>
  Not so the Boeing fuel switches: they can be relatively easily "sat" in the middle, on the centre raised bit and could be bumped either way. Hence our (non-787) FCOM saying make sure you jiggle them when you put it in the On position to confirm it's locked there.

  Mods, feel free to remove this if you think it's not contributing.
  <br>
   <br>
    Folks, the exchange here about the cutoff switches ("fuel control switches") is exactly the kind of discussion that contributes meaningfully to our collective understanding of one possible causal or contributing factor in the accident.  Smart, well-informed people politely considering and evaluating the suggestions of others.  No snark or sniping.  Love it.

  I hope/wish. I accept that it's not at all likely that TCMA is the/a culprit in this crash, but it is, like the cutoff switches, one of the few things

   designed and intended

  to shut down an engine in a very big hurry. It would be good to know as much as possible about how it determines the aircraft's ground/air state.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And add the radio altimeter(s). I think, but don't know, that they provide inputs to the FADEC TCMA function also.
