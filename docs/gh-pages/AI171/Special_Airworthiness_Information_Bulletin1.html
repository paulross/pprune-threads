  I would add a fourth, however unlikely it might be: some kind of electrical short which caused the "cutoff" signals to be sent without the physical switch moving.

  The SIAB relates to defective throttle units at the point of installation (on a different but related aircraft). I might be onboard with that theory if maintenance happened to have replaced the unit a day or 2 before the incident. But it's a tough sell that a defective switch that's used literally on every flight had flown for 2 years without someone noticing and snagging that the locking mechanism wasn't working

  Yes, which is why I said a small such range of objects. I can't see how both switches could unintentionally be moved individually one after the other unless there was something wrong with the detent mechanisms. I suppose a careless hand is also a possibility, removed from the thrust levers on rotation?

     Nothing in the report suggests that the engines began to run down before the fuel was selected to cutoff. The report states a sequence of events for power loss which
     <i>
      begins
     </i>
     with the switches MOVING or BEING MOVED to cutoff. The maximum airspeed was immediately before the switches were moved, so there had not been a power rundown prior to that:
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Interesting that the report mentions SAIB No. NM-18-33. Can you see a detent on the left switch base in the mishap photo on page 10., Fig. 13? Yes kind of blurry when blown up but maybe we have some photo gurus.

     Wouldn't they already know if the detents were missing in this case? They recovered the switches and told us what position they were in at impact.

  Unless defective. I only encountered one in a 30 plus year career where my Captain shutdown at block in and did not like the feel and checked that the detent was worn. Wrote it up. But Boeing installed some that did not have a detent and the FAA issued a SAIB, referenced in the Air India mishap report, to check for these switches because they could inadvertently be positioned to off. Whether they meant human or other inadvertent action was not clear.

  Really? It suggests to me and I would imagine the vast majority of us who have flown modern Boeings that they were physically moved, by one of the crew, one at a time, the question is why.

  Well, speaking of fuel-cut switches, I read
  <a href="https://ad.easa.europa.eu/blob/NM-18-33.pdf/SIB_NM-18-33_1" target="_blank">
   NM-18-33 SAIB
  </a>
  with attention, and as a not-that-fluent english speaker, I stumbled on this sentence (my bold):
  <br/>

   <div class="panel alt2" style="border:1px inset">
    If the locking feature is
    <b>
     disengaged
    </b>
    , the switch can be moved between the two positions without lifting the switch during transition, and the switch would be exposed to the potential of inadvertent operation.
   </div>
  </div>
  I could hardly figure what the "disengaged" word meant in this context, so I did a Google search for the switch part numbers (especially "766AT614-3D") to figure the difference between them, and
  <a href="https://www.xuefeiji.org/bbs/show-294.html" target="_blank">
   a page from this chinese web site
  </a>
  was part of the results.
  <br/>

   Incorrect lock tab position on fuel cut-off switch
  </i>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If this incorrect mounting is actually possible, it would possibly remain unnoticed from the pilots (normal "pull-up then move" action is unaffected), but it would cancel the protective function of the so-called "locking tab", and even limit the travel of the switch handle in both directions, making it more vulnerable to an undesired change of state.

  <br/>
  The photos above seem convincing enough, but I'd be very grateful for an informed opinion on this assembly mistake. Even if this is possible, the probability of
  <b>
   both
  </b>
  switches being unexpectedly snapped seems very remote to say the least, but not as remote as previously estimated.

     Well, speaking of fuel-cut switches, I read
     <a href="https://ad.easa.europa.eu/blob/NM-18-33.pdf/SIB_NM-18-33_1" target="_blank">
      NM-18-33 SAIB

     with attention, and as a not-that-fluent english speaker, I stumbled on this sentence (my bold):
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I could hardly figure what the "disengaged" word meant in this context, so I did a Google search for the switch part numbers (especially "766AT614-3D") to figure the difference between them, and
     <a href="https://www.xuefeiji.org/bbs/show-294.html" target="_blank">
      a page from this chinese web site
     </a>
     was part of the results.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     And while I was painfully crawling the thread, I noticed the following picture about an "undesirable condition":
     <br/>

  left me wondering the same thing.  It give a procedure for detecting the defect but omits to explain the cause.  I was thinking that the wrong switches had been supplied/fitted.  Assuming the image from the Chinese web site is correct, it is disappointing that the actuator can get into that state.  I did not see anything that said whether that was how the switch arrived from Honeywell or if there was a defect that allowed the actuator to turn.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One other useful thing from that web site is a partial schematic which shows the connection of the 4 poles in the switch.  I believe this is from a 737NG but it should be the same idea.

  Why are you wasting your own time?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If any of that were true why would it happen after Vr and why would one pilot ask: \x93why did you go to cutoff\x94. That is an observed deliberate action. Cmon folks enough with the nonsense!
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Why are people shying around the truth!?
