     One example of fuel contamination causing a significant loss of thrust on both engines at low altitude.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     But it seems extremely unlikely for contaminated fuel to impact both engines at
     <i>
      exactly
     </i>
     the same time, with no asymmetry and no surges or smoke.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     What can cause a sudden catastrophic loss of thrust on both engines at exactly the same time?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Birds (but no apparent surges)
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Inadvertent movement of the fuel cut off switches (which would be an incredible error but I suppose it could conceivably be muscle memory having done so recently after the last leg&hellip;weirder things have happened. Remember the 767 events of the late 80s)
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Intentional shutdown of the engines (pilot suicide has happened before)
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Some catastrophic electrical/FADEC/engine interface failure (which I highly doubt is feasible in a modern 1309 aircraft)
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I can&rsquo;t think of any others&hellip;
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  This seems to be the best summary so far. Based on the detail of the mayday its probably time to rule out the flaps, load shift, and other suggestions. Latest news is a quote from the survivor:
  <i>
   "
   <span style="color:#000000">
    Suddenly, the lights started flickering &ndash; green and white &ndash; then the plane rammed into some establishment that was there"
   </span>
  </i>
  <span style="color:#000000">
   .
  </span>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I cant think of any reason for electrical failure and "no thrust" (as per statements) without any visual cues other than (a) suicide, or (b) starvation. Is there any electrical failure that can cause fuel valves to close? I dont fly Boeing, so can any Dreamliner driver explain what conditions could trigger an overspeed and auto engine shutdown (quote from Google below)? Would short runway, and hot/low QNH do it? Also, what happened to the order demanding a full power down/recycle every 51 days?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <i>
   <span style="color:#080809">
    The EEC has build in protections to protect the engine. One of these protections is the Engine Overspeed Protection, when the core engine exceeds 120% the EEC shuts off the fuel to the applicable engine.

  There is evidence on this thread that flaps were not the issue. The Mayday call and the evidence that the RAT was out is more convincing than a gear/flap mixup. Early on in this thread the gear/flap mixup had a lot of traction but after more photographic evidence surfaced it has more or less been put to rest, for me anyhow.

  Hi everyone, 787 driver here, well lets look at the facts we see
  <br/>
  very late rotation, but pitch and departure path look like normal up until stalling point.
  <br/>
  mayday was called but without clarification or purpose, for me this indicates stress in the flight deck, especially low level
  <br/>
  no smoke or fire from engines, I would rule out severe damage or birdstrikes at this point
  <br/>
  Flaps 5 departure would be difficult to see as a pixel on a bad video, but they would not have made the rotation at that speed so I assume they used flaps during departure, also you would neglect to ECL's and a config warning
  <br/>
  no RAT to be seen either, again ruling out dual engine failure, also the climb would not have been so parabolic
  <br/>
  maybe single engine fuel starvation/Mechanical issue/dirty fuel, but seems unlikely, the flight path is too gentle
  <br/>
  Gear stays down, and even though the pitch remains the same, they start losing lift and basically stall the aircraft into the ground
  <br/>
  don't forget, Air India uses 64/67K engines on they're 787's, with temp of 41 degrees (ambient, so even more above tarmac) and a QNH of 1001, those engines will be pushed to "hard work mode" already
  <br/>
  <br/>
  IMHO, two things I could assume happend
  <br/>
  - either single engine failure, no pitch adjustment and speed fell below Vstall, OR, most likely
  <br/>
  - mixup of Flaps moved to up position in stead of Gear moved to up position, that would clarify the gear, would clarify the loss of lift and that the engines have no smoke, and no RAT,

  Assuming the reported Mayday message is correct then a final message indicating a hopeless situation has to be a possibility.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Possibly the Captain did correctly perceive the information on the status of the aircraft
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Possibly he did correctly comprehend the situation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Possibly he did project the situation into the future

  a few things stated as fact there without any evidence to support the assertions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  very late rotation - stated several times on this thread but zero evidence for it and some analysis suggests the rotation was at roughly the same location as previous departures of the same flight
  <br/>
  <br/>
  no RAT - others, including one with a lot of experience with the sound of a deployed RAT, insist that it was deployed. The video evidence is unclear.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Not saying you\x92re necessarily wrong about anything but I take issue with those that state as fact things that are not (yet) supported by any evidence at all

  <br/>
  Many GE engines - including GEnx-1B/67s - require microprocessors to be routinely replaced due to soldered joints failing after multiple cycles. There is a 2021 AD that notes
  <i>
   "This AD was prompted by an in-service occurrence of loss of engine thrust control resulting in uncommanded high thrust"
  </i>
  (I cannot post a link but google: 2021-25491 (86 FR 66447))
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I am NOT suggesting that this specific failure mode happened here - for one thing, this would happen to one engine, not both. But on any flight it is possible that a unique set of sensor inputs to occur that are the first time any system has encountered them (example: NATS incident in 2023), and then you need failover &amp; redundancy to keep things working.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The GE Aviation CCS system, which includes thrust management, has up to now flown for 1m flight hours without incident. It would be interesting to hear the perspectives of any engineers familiar with the system.

  So what is known at the moment?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - The flight crew consisted of an experienced Captain and a First Officer with a little more than 1000 hours. Whether or not this flight was a training event appears not yet determined.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - The aircraft departed from Ahmedabad, using full length of the runway, lifting off at an appropriate distance from the departure end and reaching an altitude of less than 1000ft before descending again to an impact. It therefore got out of ground effect. Also, the power selected for takeoff was sufficient to get the aircraft airborne within the constraints of the field.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - The landing gear was left down much longer than usual and remained so for the whole duration of the flight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - Flaps appear to have been extended normally to a setting not triggering any pre-takeoff configuration warning. On the 787, extended TE flaps are not as obviously visible as on other types, especially with low quality pictures, but a gap between the flaps and the wing proper was visible, showing a glimpse of the engine nacelle through it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - Whether or not the RAT was out appears not entirely clear, although there are strong indicators of it being deployed. If this is confirmed, this seems to point to a major engine or electric issue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - Engine noise is surprisingly low on the available videos, either drowned out by environnmental noise (the 787 is not a noisy bird) or due to lack of power produced.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - Descent was at a very high AOA and appears not intentional. The crew did not decide to push the nose down.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - The aircraft appears to have been structurally intact with nothing issuing from it. No debris, smoke, fumes or liquids were in trail, no parts were observed to have been lost or dropped.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - There seems to have been a mayday call from the aircraft, possibly indicating power issues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The crew seems to have found no reason to abort the takeoff before V1. Whatever befell them must have struck past that speed and given them cause not to retract the landing gear. Whether the lever was not moved or the systems did not react to it is not determined yet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The aircraft had enough energy to climb to about 600, in any case less than 1000ft altitude. Ahmedabad seems not to call for a specific NADP, but whether it was NADP1, 2, A or B that was flown, it is fairly safe to assume that its normal regime would have been takeoff power and takeoff flap settings at that time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Multiple other aircraft departed from or arrived at Ahmedabad before the accident, of which at least one must in all probability have taken onboard the fuel from the local bowsers in substantial amounts and used it without troubles, or else there would have been other flights in trouble due to this.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I am awaiting the preliminary report from the authorities and the readout of the data recorders with much interest.

  We haven't thought about it because it didn't happen. We have a video of the plane with no engine sound and the RAT clearly audible. The RAT is also visible in the video.

     I think this is the wrong attitude and technique, but it's an opinion.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     To me the radio call signals possibly helplessness and confusion.I do not think a pilot who understands what is going on would make the call. He would be too busy trouble shooting. It could be a sign that is was NOT an engine failure or a bird strike ( in both cases they would have mentioned it). Nor a deliberate crash. They had no idea why they could not climb and that tells me they most probably retracted the flaps. Time will tell.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Well of course they didn't understand what's going on. Something happened to them that has happened to a handful of people in history and is supposed to be essentially impossible. They didn't have the 'luxury' Sully had of a few thousand feet safety of altitude margin to think about it either.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Of course the didn't know
  <i>
   why
  </i>
  they'd lost power, they just knew they'd lost it. Yeh they would have felt pretty helpless 200 feet above the ground surrounded by tall buildings. My heart goes out to them being by that point no more than passengers to their own death. At least the actual passengers didn't have to watch the building coming at them knowing there was no escape. It's unthinkable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  So I don't know how on earth you think this suggests the flap theory. You're reading an awful lot into the words of a man who was likely processing the fact he's about to die in a horrific way.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Can we just forget about flaps? We have pictures of the wing at the crash site with flaps extended. The plane is on video with no engine noise and the RAT audible and visible. The pilot sent a mayday saying they'd lost thrust. The only survivor says the lights were flickering and the cabin went dark. Why are some people so desperate to pin this on a pilot mistake there is zero evidence for?

     no RAT to be seen either, again ruling out dual engine failure, also the climb would not have been so parabolic
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  The visual evidence of the RAT being deployed (or not) is a bit dubious, but the audio evidence is pretty solid. It's also corroborated by the best eye witnesses we have, the pilots, explaining that they had lost power in their mayday call. And corroborated again by the second best eye witness we have, the passenger who survived, commenting on the 'green flickering lights' of the emergency exit signs indicating power loss. And corroborated
  <i>
   again
  </i>
  by the (now confirmed) posts on social media from the previous set of passengers complaining that aircon, entertainment, lights etc on the plain weren't working.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The idea that the flaps weren't set for take off also seems incredibly dubious given that in several frames of the original footage you can see the engines through the wings, on both sides, something not explainable by grainy footage or compression artifacts, and only possible if the flaps are down.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Edit to add: the reports on social media from the previous passengers complaining about non-functional electronics have been confirmed

  It has been mentioned repeatedly in this thread, including supposed transcripts of what was said, but no audio recording has surfaced, nor an explanation of where the transcripts came from, so I would call it a rumour.

   Plane crash near Ahmedabad

  Here is a very unlikely scenario. It may be possible that there was nothing wrong with the aircraft.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  We have been told the experience levels of the pilots but not how long they have been flying the 787.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 787 is very automatic and, in my experience, the easiest aircraft to fly. It does a lot of things for you and reminds you of things that you may have forgotten to do. For that reason, in my opinion it is also the safest aircraft around. However, you have to understand what the automatics are doing in order to manage it correctly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By putting the departure route into the FMC you set up the lateral navigation and also the vertical navigation including speeds and altitudes. After take-off the FMC will command you initially to fly at up to V2 + 20 until flap retraction ( normally no lower than 1000 feet agl), and then increase the speed with flap retraction until initial climb speed and then final climb speed above FL 100.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If your first altitude restriction on departure is 4000 feet (which will be in the FMC) and VNAV is engaged you will level at 4000 feet. But, if prior to departure, you put 3000 feet in the altitude window (maybe as instructed by ATC) the aircraft will level at 3000 feet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If I remember correctly LNAV engages at 50 feet and VNAV engages at 400 feet agl. And, I may be mistaken, but I think that the auto-pilot could be engaged at 100 feet agl.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Now, I am probably wrong about this, but if you forget to set the altitude window to the first altitude in departure and leave it at 0 (which with some airlines the previous crew will do on shutdown) the following might possibly occur. At 50 feet LNAV engages, at 100 feet the autopilot engages, at 400 feet VNAV engages but as the altitude window is set to 0 the aircraft (on autopilot) now descends to capture 0 feet. The speed at this point in VNAV is low (max V2 + 20 kts) so, to maintain that, both thrust levers close. This, of course, would be totally unexpected and could have a startle effect. If you do not realise what has caused this you might think that there is a problem with the engines and you have very little time to deal with it. I would suggest that putting out a Mayday call at this stage is not a good use of time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As I stated at the beginning this is probably very unlikely and may not be possible, but could be tried in a simulator.

     It's fine that the \x93Enhanced Airborne Flight Recorders\x94 have 10 minutes battery backup. If the bits of equipment/sensors sending data to be recorded don't have power, you will be recording 10 minutes of silence/blank data.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The concept of powering 'critical (sensor) equipment' has been floated - the problem being that it
     <i>
      must
     </i>
     be possible to power down malfunctioning equipment in case of fire - real or suspected. Having independent power supplies and battery back-ups all around the airframe, each with an ability to lose their magic smoke, is a poor idea.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Commercial passenger jet aircraft already have robust power supplies with multiple generators and emergency battery support. However, if one malfunctions, rather than fails completely, it can be difficult to decide which one to disable, as it can cause problems in all systems.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  IIRC the CVR battery (in this case EAFR battery) is required to power at least the cockpit area microphone, if not the pilots' mics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Once the RAT deployed at least some data should have come back.

  This has been discussed upthread and has happened before (on a 777 IIRC) but did not result in a crash.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It does not explain the RAT and generally you would expect crews to shove the thrust levers fully forward.

  I think that the only thing that would matter for any of us in that 20 seconds would be THRUST and everything it's got.

     Here is a very unlikely scenario. It may be possible that there was nothing wrong with the aircraft.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     We have been told the experience levels of the pilots but not how long they have been flying the 787.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The 787 is very automatic and, in my experience, the easiest aircraft to fly. It does a lot of things for you and reminds you of things that you may have forgotten to do. For that reason, in my opinion it is also the safest aircraft around. However, you have to understand what the automatics are doing in order to manage it correctly.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     By putting the departure route into the FMC you set up the lateral navigation and also the vertical navigation including speeds and altitudes. After take-off the FMC will command you initially to fly at up to V2 + 20 until flap retraction ( normally no lower than 1000 feet agl), and then increase the speed with flap retraction until initial climb speed and then final climb speed above FL 100.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     If your first altitude restriction on departure is 4000 feet (which will be in the FMC) and VNAV is engaged you will level at 4000 feet. But, if prior to departure, you put 3000 feet in the altitude window (maybe as instructed by ATC) the aircraft will level at 3000 feet.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     If I remember correctly LNAV engages at 50 feet and VNAV engages at 400 feet agl. And, I may be mistaken, but I think that the auto-pilot could be engaged at 100 feet agl.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Now, I am probably wrong about this, but if you forget to set the altitude window to the first altitude in departure and leave it at 0 (which with some airlines the previous crew will do on shutdown) the following might possibly occur. At 50 feet LNAV engages, at 100 feet the autopilot engages, at 400 feet VNAV engages but as the altitude window is set to 0 the aircraft (on autopilot) now descends to capture 0 feet. The speed at this point in VNAV is low (max V2 + 20 kts) so, to maintain that, both thrust levers close. This, of course, would be totally unexpected and could have a startle effect. If you do not realise what has caused this you might think that there is a problem with the engines and you have very little time to deal with it. I would suggest that putting out a Mayday call at this stage is not a good use of time.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     As I stated at the beginning this is probably very unlikely and may not be possible, but could be tried in a simulator.

  Totally agreed. But at some point with the buildings coming into 8k definition, one would hope that a pilot experienced enough to be employed on a 787 would disconnect everything, firewall it and pull up the nose..

     I am curious how this can happen? The handle for the gear is on a completely different place in the cockpit that the flaps handle.
     <br/>
     Possibly a B787 pilot could give us an idea?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     What is nearby the flaps handle are the switches for the "fuel control".

  2 types of error for wrong procedure here:
  <br/>
  Mechanical (physical) error and mental (flow) error.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If 2 levers are close to each other and you grab the wrong one without looking (condition levers/flaps in turboprop) then that's a mechanical error, unlikely yes here.
  <br/>
  But... a mental error choosing the wrong item out of 2 when BOTH are part of normal takeoff procedure would (and has been) a simple error to make if concentration not there for some reason. Or inexperience. Gear up would certainly be the first action once climbing out but what if the pilot flying had actually called flaps 1 or retract flaps? Personally think this is not as likely as loss of power, or premature rotation for available power. Do we know if that MAYDAY was actually made for certain yet? If it was then only a major catastrophic event would divert the pilots from trying to fly the plane to making any radio call. They were (hopefully) on take off thrust the whole time and what goes up does not easily come down without a major change of energy. I was really surprised most by no obvious attempt to lower the nose to gain speed early on. They had clearance altitude for some acceleration. Some terrible CG imbalance maybe? Way too early and minimal facts to even speculate yet.
