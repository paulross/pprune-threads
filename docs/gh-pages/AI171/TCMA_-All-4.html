     DO-178 unless propulsion systems are for some reason different from displays and flight controls.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I have been on the fringes of dissimilar hardware and dissimilar software designs (MD-11 flight controls). Sometimes it is necessary but there is a huge overhead in both development and test.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Edit to add - Even with dissimilar processor and software the requirements for both will trace up to some common high level system requirements specification. There is a non zero probability that those top level requirement were inadequate or included an error.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Yea, I think you're right - DO-178 is aviation software - now that I think about it, DO-160 might be electro-magnetic effects (i.e. HIRF/Lightning).  It's not something I need to worry about anymore so it's not something I make a point of remembering
  <img alt="" border="0" class="inlineimg" src="https://www.pprune.org/images/smilies/embarass.gif" title="Embarrassment"/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I doubt the issue would be in top level requirements - those are pretty simple and straightforward.  It's the devil of the details where an error might have occurred.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All that being said, I have a hard time with the idea that TCMA activated without a
  <i>
   big
  </i>
  thrust lever movement (even if you assume an issue with the air/ground indication) - and there is absolutely no reason why the thrust levers would be moved right after rotation.

  On the 747, Weight on Wheels (WoW) depends on prox sensors on the landing gear (i.e. gear compression). I don't know how that's done on the 787.
  <br/>
  The reason we used both Radio Alt and WoW is that both can give erroneous indications on certain conditions - RA can be 'fooled' by dense rain or even really dense fog (the signals bounce off the water and falsely indicate on-ground), the prox sensor system can subject to HIRF/Lightning interference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  TCMA acts quickly, but it does require some persistence, so an input glitch won't activate it (mainly N1, which is measured every 15 milliseconds).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  What sort of 'confirmation' do you have in mind - the regulator mandate that resulted in TCMA basically says we can't take credit for the flight crew.

  Can any 787 drivers confirm if TCMA would/could activate if a pilot were to inadvertently cause unusual and/or asymmetric thrust with the levers after V1 and through VR (before being airborne)?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I.e. if there was some hesitation in aborting TO, could a few seconds at high power with somewhat asymmetric levers have caused TCMA to activate?

  I've been looking and haven't found the current TCMA configuration for that engine yet.  Perhaps of interest, I did find that Boeing petitioned for and received an exemption from \xa7\xa7 25.901(c) and 25.1309(b) in 2016.

  What gets your attention is the fact that you can continue to operate the aircraft without an MMEL entry when one of the two systems (per EEC) that shadow each other... is unserviceable.

     Inlet compliance is tested at max takeoff power settings, at AOA up to stall. This is done by performing something called a 'wind-up turn' - with the engine at max TO power and constant altitude, they keep pulling the turn tighter until the wing stalls and the aircraft falls out of the turn.
     <br/>
     If the engine doesn't continue normal operation, that's considered a 'fail'. Plus, the engine reaction of an over-rotated inlet (inlet separation) is a surge - accompanied by big bang and a ball of flame out the back.
     <br/>
     Nothing we know about this accident supports an over-rotation and related engine stall/surge.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Adding to your response TD, there is no time in this event where a high AOA arose prior to the final moments, around 13 seconds after the problem has occurred. AOA, intake separation is not a factor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Going back to your prior comments on FADEC and TCMA; these are independent systems to each engine, however the event indicates a symmetric loss, and the potential of water ingress from a failed E/E sealing from the main cabin services remains a single causation that could result in multiple failures at the same moment. The last time I assessed issues in the E/E bay related to unauthorised inflight access to the fwd E/E of a B777 it was sobering how many irreversible conditions could arise. The B744 water inundation cases I was involved in were both on TO, the QF event was during deceleration. We are looking at vectors that come from outside of the normal assumptions in the SSA's, water fits that bill.

  One related question: since it was reported that the packs were not functional on the previous flight and were (presumably?) fixed before the accident flight, could condensation of excess humidity in the E/E bay be a relevant mechanism?

  According to the MMEL available on the FAA website there are 8 air/ground sensors on the main gear. Two tilt sensors and two compression sensors on each strut. Can be dispatched with just one tilt sensor and one compression sensor working on each side.

  Thanks for posting this.  I read it quickly and glanced at the drawings, which are adequate for the patent application but not nearly adequate to understand the system in any depth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I note that, unless I missed it, the patent application doesn't address a mechanism for determining whether an aircraft is actually on the ground.  I suppose that will depend on some of those "several other digital inputs."

  As I noted previously, the FADEC is a dual channel device.  It's long been the case that dispatch is allowed with a single FADEC channel failed (this goes back to the original PW4000/CF6-80C2 as installed on the 747-400 and 767.
  <br/>
  The MMEL says something like "4 installed, 3 required" (referring to individual FADEC channels) - so you can dispatch for a short time with one FADEC channel failed.  Yes, if the remaining channel of faulted FADEC fails, the engine will fail - but the FADEC reliability is such that the probability of losing the remaining channel (and hence the engine) is sufficiently small as to be acceptable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both channels can operate TCMA, so a single channel failure has not overall effect on the system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Again, 'channel out' dispatch is nothing new - it's been the case since 1989 (when the PW4000/767 entered service).

     On the 747, Weight on Wheels (WoW) depends on prox sensors on the landing gear (i.e. gear compression). I don't know how that's done on the 787.
     <br/>
     The reason we used both Radio Alt and WoW is that both can give erroneous indications on certain conditions - RA can be 'fooled' by dense rain or even really dense fog (the signals bounce off the water and falsely indicate on-ground), the prox sensor system can subject to HIRF/Lightning interference.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     TCMA acts quickly, but it does require some persistence, so an input glitch won't activate it (mainly N1, which is measured every 15 milliseconds).
     <br/>
     <br/>
     What sort of 'confirmation' do you have in mind - the regulator mandate that resulted in TCMA basically says we can't take credit for the flight crew.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Where does the logic block that takes the WoW and other inputs to generate the singe air/ground indication live?  Is it somewhere that would be affected by the aircraft power systems?  Could a failure in the aircraft power cause a false ground indication to be sent to the FADECs?

  Repeating myself (again), but ALL the TCMA logic is resident in the FADEC.  It takes aircraft inputs of air/ground (again, not familiar with the specifics of the air/ground logic used on the 787/GEnx-1B, so don't ask), thrust lever position, and what the engine is actually doing (mainly N1) to determine if the engine is 'out of control'.
  <br/>
  The thrust lever inputs are hardwired (resolvers connected to the thrust levers, powered by the FADEC), other aircraft communications on the 787 are on an ethernet based network.  Default mode for the FADEC if aircraft inputs are lost or invalid is "Air", as that is generally considered to be the 'safe' choice.
  <br/>
  But even assuming some aircraft fault caused the FADECs to falsely believe the aircraft was 'on-ground', it would
  <i>
   still
  </i>
  take a pretty major error in the TCMA logic for it to actually trigger and shutdown the engine (especially lacking an associated thrust lever movement to idle).  Never say never, but we're getting pretty far out on the probability tree for all these things to happen.

  And most of all, the SISO principle (#### in #### out) applies with regard to data from other systems, which are obviously processed in TCMA. Multiple transient faults may not be considered comprehensively e.g. in input processing and filtering.

  Yes. Thank you tdracer. All those postulating TCMA / FADEC faults please read and understand this clear explanation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Then, ask yourselves which extraordinarily low probability bundle of previously unrevealed faults could spontaneously manifest themselves on both engines simultaneously.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also ask yourselves why these faults manifested at that critical phase of flight and not during taxiing or take-off roll when some of the TCMA sensors would have been primed.
