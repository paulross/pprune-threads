    The CCTV footage obtained from the airport showed Ram Air Turbine (RAT) getting deployed
    <br/>
    during the initial climb immediately after lift-off (fig. 15). No significant bird activity is observed

    <br/>
    the APU Auto Start logic. Thereafter at 08:08:56 UTC the Engine 2 fuel cutoff switch also
    <br/>
    transitions from CUTOFF to RUN. When fuel control switches are moved from CUTOFF to

    <br/>
    The EGT was observed to be rising for both engines indicating relight. Engine 1&rsquo;s core
    <br/>
    deceleration stopped, reversed and started to progress to recovery. Engine 2 was able to
    <br/>
    relight but could not arrest core speed deceleration and re-introduced fuel repeatedly to
    <br/>
    increase core speed acceleration and recovery. The EAFR recording stopped at 08:09:11
    <br/>
    UTC
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As per the EAFR data both engines N2 values passed below minimum idle speed, and the

     The switch state could be either on or off in that position. However, the CVR makes it pretty clear that the switches were moved deliberately to off. Just not why. Also, remember the report says one switch was moved then the other. Not together.

  The exact quote was

  <br/>
  "The aircraft achieved the maximum recorded airspeed of 180 Knots IAS at about 08:08:42 UTC and immediately thereafter, the Engine 1 and Engine 2 fuel cutoff switches transitioned from RUN to CUTOFF position one after another with a time gap of 01 sec."

  <br/>
  Does anyone know what the sampling frequency of the data is? If we get one readout per second, then it's possible that a one second difference could only be a millisecond difference in real life, which doesn't necessarily rule out an accidental bump.
  <br/>
  If there truly was a second of difference, there aren't many other options than an intentional act. Not necessarily with the purpose of crashing the plane though (confusion, hallucination, distraction, ..)

  The phrase in the report is "switches transitioned from RUN to CUTOFF position".
  <br/>
  Does the FDR actually have some input of the physical position of the switches or is it just measuring the output signal voltage
  <br/>
  which might be changed by a momentary short from liquid or swarf.
  <br/>
  Both signals go to cutoff within 1 second but then one recovers four seconds after the other.
  <br/>
  Surely a pilot discovering a turned off switch would have both back on in less than four seconds.

  Again, you can not conclude that from the report.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Different inputs are sampled at different rates. Some very basic info here:
  <a href="https://scaledanalytics.com/2023/04/25/arinc-767-or-what-do-you-mean-my-b787-uses-767-data/" target="_blank">
   https://scaledanalytics.com/2023/04/...uses-767-data/
  </a>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's highly likely switch positions are only sampled at 1Hz, and not at 100 Hz. For engine parameters you'll likely want a higher sample rate, as the whole engine could go from perfectly fine to exploded in less than a second.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If you had something like:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  08:08:42.96 UTC: cut off switch 1
  <br/>
  08:08:43.01 UTC: cut off switch 2
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It would likely be recorded as:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  08:08:42 UTC: cut off switch 1
  <br/>
  08:08:43 UTC: cut off switch 2
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leading you to believe there was one second between these 2 actions, whereas it was actually only 50ms.

  From the report, there is no indicated time stamp identifying the point when one pilot asked the other "why did you cut off"
  <br/>
  This could explain the the assumption that it took ten seconds to reverse the switch positions.
  <br/>
  Cut off could have been noticed at any point later than 08:08:42 but before 08:08:52.

  Nothing in the report suggests that the engines began to run down before the fuel was selected to cutoff. The report states a sequence of events for power loss which
  <i>
   begins
  </i>
  with the switches being moved to cutoff. The maximum airspeed was immediately before the switches were moved, so there had not been a power rundown prior to that:

    The AAIB clearly pulled the N2 data at least out of the EAFR. There is no indication that the engines were operating abnormally prior to being switched off. We also see this:

      It seems like people are jumping to conclusions about the pilots and letting Boeing off the hook without proper investigation. Instead of providing a professional, detailed transcript of the cockpit voice recorder (CVR), we&rsquo;re just getting casual comments about what the pilot allegedly said. Critical information&mdash;like the timing of transmissions, the checklist items completed before takeoff, and other key details that should be on the CVR&mdash;are essential for understanding what happened in the cockpit, especially since the crash occurred so soon after takeoff. In my view, the preliminary report feels too convenient for certain parties involved.
     </span>

  This is a preliminary report. It is quite detailed for a preliminary report.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Examining the before-takeoff checklists seems like it would be akin to examining the re-arrangement of the deckchairs before the titanic even hit the iceberg.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The engines were switched off. Unlike Embraer, B &amp; A have no protections stopping you switching an engine off inadvertently. From everything in the report, everything operated exactly as designed. I am not certain of how long the relight window is without windmilling speed, but +- 10 seconds seems entirely reasonable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The outstanding question that presumably requires much more in-depth investigation of the wreckage items and CVR audio is whether:
  <ul>
   <li>
    the cutoff switches were operated deliberately (and by who)
   </li>
   <li>
    the cutoff switches were operated inadvertently (and by who)
   </li>
   <li>
    the cutoff switches were bumped (by what) and the guards failed or weren't installed
   </li>
   <li>
    some electrical failure perfectly mimicked both many-pole switches being operated, then being operated again (seems unlikely)
   </li>
  </ul>

     From the report, there is no indicated time stamp identifying the point when one pilot asked the other "why did you cut off"
     <br/>
     This could explain the the assumption that it took ten seconds to reverse the switch positions.
     <br/>
     Cut off could have been noticed at any point later than 08:08:42 but before 08:08:52.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  From my reading of the AAIB report, the delay in noticing the cut off switch position could not have been any later than 08:08:47 because the reference to the verbal exchange was written before the reference to the RAT deployment and I assume the written narrative follows the chronological sequence of events.  The delay in resetting those fuel switches might therefore have been no more than 5 seconds.  It is a pity that the pilot making the challenge didn't simply reset the switches to run instead of challenging the other pilot.  I frequently tell people who blow their horns at pedestrians or other motorists that blowing the horn isn't going to help them avoid an accident and that what they really need to do in the limited time available to them is concentrate on applying the brakes and turning the steering wheel.

  SLF: I have a small observation but I'm not sure what it means or if it has any relevance to the accident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Previously I had assumed that the ADS-B data cut out at the same time as power was lost, so I imagined that whatever caused the fairly clear loss of thrust would have happened not too long before. But this report throws a bit of a wrench in my understanding of that.
  <br/>

  According to the report, the fuel cutoff switches transition from RUN to CUTOFF at or very shortly after 08:08:42 UTC. Both engines' N2 values pass below minimum idle speed and the RAT begins supplying hydraulic power at about 08:08:47. Does this not imply that the generators have already been lost? With the APU also being off (the APU inlet door is noted to start opening at 08:08:54), I would have expected ADS-B data to cut out at or before 08:08:47. But curiously FlightRadar24 at least claims to have received data frames from the aircraft until 08:08:51.640970, almost five seconds later and almost ten seconds after the transition to CUTOFF (though the last frame containing coordinates comes at 08:08:50.871005).

  Could anyone with relevant experience confirm how long it would take for AC power to be lost in this situation? Also, is it usual/unusual for a preliminary report like this to mention if/when the flight recorder switched to its independent power supply? I imagine it would definitely be in the final report, but I'd hoped it would be easily observable enough to be in this one.
  <br/>

  Beyond idle curiosity I'm asking because the report
  <i>
   also
  </i>
  says the no. 1 engine's cutoff switch transitioned from CUTOFF to RUN at "about 08:08:52", which oddly coincides with the last ADS-B data frame at 08:08:51.640970, and that seems important somehow. Or more likely I'm just ignorant of some quirk of the 787's electrical system.

  For reference FR24's CSV containing all ADS-B frames supposedly received from the aircraft can be found in their post here:

     "The aircraft achieved the maximum recorded airspeed of 180 Knots IAS at about 08:08:42 UTC and immediately thereafter, the Engine 1 and Engine 2 fuel cutoff switches transitioned from RUN to CUTOFF position one after another with a time gap of 01 sec."

   This might have been discussed but as has been suggested upthread; a possible scenario is that at some point, PIC took their hands off the thrust levers and/or placed them in a guarding position behind the thrust levers at their base - but by doing so unfortunately nudged the Fuel cut-off switches to 'Off' - perhaps 'helped' by there either being incorrectly fitted locking mechanisms or worn locking mechanisms ?
