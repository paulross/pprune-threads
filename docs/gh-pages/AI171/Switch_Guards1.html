  If you look at the mechanism, and imagine the physical obstacle that makes the lift necessary not being there, it could conceivably be connecting, yes. It would then be like any other switch, really.

  The switch state could be either on or off in that position. However, the CVR makes it pretty clear that the switches were moved deliberately to off. Just not why.  Also, remember the report says one switch was moved then the other.  Not together.

     The landing gear lever is forward and up on the centre instrument panel, adjacent to the PFD. The fuel control switches are aft and low, on the thrust pedestal. There's no reasonable way to confuse one for the other in terms of position, hand movement or 'muscle memory'.

  No there is not. Further investigation will likely see if the locking detents were in a decent state or not. TBQH, such a switch should be properly guarded. Like a Embraer is, like other types that one sees with switches one has to lift a guard to operate and is locked on with the guard in position. Boeing designers found out again in not making processes fool proof?

     The report mentions that the immediate prior flight crew had written up a "STAB POS XDCR" status message, and that troubleshooting was carried out.
     <br/>
     Is it possible that the troubleshooting/diagnostics left the stab cutout switches on the pedestal in the cutoff position, which went unnoticed until liftoff (i.e. upon noticing that the trim wasn't operable), resulting in a reach towards those switches, which are situated right next to the engine cutoff switches?
    </div>

  Like this? Actually, the middle switches should look like the port side ones IMHO. Properly guarded.

  it would have to be small enough to fit between the idle throttle position and guards on each side of the switches and weigh enough to push the switches over the detent, unless the SAIB cones into play.

  Yes, which is why I said a small such range of objects. I can't see how both switches could unintentionally be moved individually one after the other unless there was something wrong with the detent mechanisms. I suppose a careless hand is also a possibility, removed from the thrust levers on rotation?

  Thank you! We are getting deep into fantasy land when people who've never touched one of these switches in their lives are convincing themselves of the nearly impossible probability that someone on the flight deck did not physically move the switches from RUN to CUTOFF one at a time. Who and why are the real questions.

     A point already mentioned, but has had very little subsequent discussion.
     <br/>
     <b>
      Location and functionality of these switches.
     </b>
     Being that they are permitted to allow fuel isolation at take off thrust, would it be more appropriate to locate them in a position less likely to be inadvertently or accidentally manipulated. Or at least, have them fully guarded?
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Boeing has put the fuel control switches in more or less that same position starting with the 707 (it may go back even further).  Over a billion flight cycles on 707, 727, 737, 747, 757, 767, 777, and 787 (not to mention various military installations such as the KC-135.

     If you are saying that the action required to switch on the fuel is the same as the action to switch off the fuel, a simple toggle action, then you are right.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Toggle refers to the over-center mechanism inside the switch.  It is independent of the method used to guard against inadvertent operation.  You could have a switch with simple sliding contacts that also had a pull to operate guard but that would not be a toggle switch.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The whole point is that toggle switches do not fall between one position and the other whether they are guarded, not guarded, or have a defective guard mechanism.   It takes force on the lever to swing the internal over-center toggling mechanism to the other position.

       Why are we concentrating on the engine switches .?
       <br/>
       What happened before this to cause the engines to run down, resulting in the crew trying the documented procedure of turning the switches off then on to restart ?.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Basically they ran out of time to resolve the problem.
      </div>
     </div>
    </div>
    The AAIB clearly pulled the N2 data at least out of the EAFR. There is no indication that the engines were operating abnormally prior to being switched off. We also see this:

      It seems like people are jumping to conclusions about the pilots and letting Boeing off the hook without proper investigation. Instead of providing a professional, detailed transcript of the cockpit voice recorder (CVR), we&rsquo;re just getting casual comments about what the pilot allegedly said. Critical information&mdash;like the timing of transmissions, the checklist items completed before takeoff, and other key details that should be on the CVR&mdash;are essential for understanding what happened in the cockpit, especially since the crash occurred so soon after takeoff. In my view, the preliminary report feels too convenient for certain parties involved.
     </span>
    </div>

  </div>
  This is a preliminary report. It is quite detailed for a preliminary report.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Examining the before-takeoff checklists seems like it would be akin to examining the re-arrangement of the deckchairs before the titanic even hit the iceberg.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The engines were switched off. Unlike Embraer, B &amp; A have no protections stopping you switching an engine off inadvertently. From everything in the report, everything operated exactly as designed. I am not certain of how long the relight window is without windmilling speed, but +- 10 seconds seems entirely reasonable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The outstanding question that presumably requires much more in-depth investigation of the wreckage items and CVR audio is whether:
  <ul>
   <li>
    the cutoff switches were operated deliberately (and by who)
   </li>
   <li>
    the cutoff switches were operated inadvertently (and by who)
   </li>
   <li>
    the cutoff switches were bumped (by what) and the guards failed or weren't installed
   </li>
   <li>
    some electrical failure perfectly mimicked both many-pole switches being operated, then being operated again (seems unlikely)
   </li>
  </ul>

  Firewall shutoff switches are guarded, fire bottle switches are guarded or require both hands to operate, all require two deliberate actions to operate, except two switches in the middle of the console which do so many consrquential things..

  They have a reasonably substantial pull-out gate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Over-guarding stuff can have its own issues. People become used to operating the guard as part of normal operations, and it becomes muscle memory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apparently Embraer aircraft inhibit the shutoff switch if the thrust lever is above idle - if you have a stuck thrust lever, you need to use the fire shutoff.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another option would be to have a blocking solenoid (with override button) similar to the landing gear lever while airborne or at high speed.

  I don&rsquo;t know if the FDR measures the switch position or the electrical signal. The latter is probably more likely, although there has been much discussion around potential scenarios involving accidental switch movement as well as possible causes of electrical glitches. Let&rsquo;s assume that the switches were actually moved, and ignoring the &ldquo;bad faith&rdquo; scenario, we need a situation that encompasses the switches being moved to Cutoff by one pilot, this action being queried by the other pilot and denied by the pilot who moved the switches.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For consideration, here is a possible scenario that hasn&rsquo;t been mentioned yet and encompasses the frailty of human performance. The report mentions that the flight crew on the immediately prior flight had written up a "STAB POS XDCR" status message, and that troubleshooting was carried out.  I wonder if the scenario could be that the accident crew received a Stabiliser EICAS message on or around take-off and the Capt (who was PM) decided to action the first checklist item immediately from memory, by intending to move the Stab switches to Cutoff but moving the fuel switches instead. As in all modern Boeings, the Stabiliser Cutoff switches are immediately next to the Fuel Cutoff switches and operate in the same sense (i.e. down for Cutoff).  They are guarded and never normally moved but, with an intent to move the stab switches, &ldquo;muscle memory&rdquo; (cerebellum activation if you prefer) may have taken the Captain&rsquo;s hand to the Fuel switches, which are operated on every flight. The FO (who is PF) is manually flying at this stage sees and queries it. The Capt denies it, as he doesn&rsquo;t realise what he has done (confirmation bias perhaps). After a few seconds, the terrible mistake is realised, and the fuel switches are moved back to run, but sadly too late and the Capt makes a Mayday call.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Perhaps a bit of a stretch but not as much of a stretch as many of the other scenarios in this thread. I think it is a real possibility. Sadly, the only other explanation that I can see is the deliberate &ldquo;bad faith&rdquo; scenario, which we would all hope is incorrect.

  A plausible theory, however, if that were indeed the case wouldn't supporting FDR data be available/have been included in the initial report?

     I operated such guarded pull-move switches on several plane types uncounted times and not a single time in my entire pilot career i had a situation that such a switch "sits" on top of the locking gate and suddenly snaps by itself .
     <br/>
     It is either positivly on or off .
     <br/>
     <br/>
     In theory i could with much fantasy imagine dirt around the locking gate that keeps it pulled where you believe its latched but imaging that
     <u>
      both
     </u>
     switches were sitting on top of the gate and snapped back at the very moment of rotation is too much fantasy for me .
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Further , even with a non working locking gate such a switch would never move by accleration forces of the plane alone , it needs positive manual input .
     <br/>
     <br/>
     their position roughly behind the thrust levers does not offer any space to store there lets say your phone which slips down and moves them .
     <br/>
     <br/>
     one more point : during the very moment of rotation there is normally not a single reason to change anything in the vicinity of the center console at all to explain why you even had your hands there .
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  A phone, iPad or similar weighted object (not necessarily placed there by the pilots) left on the glare shield may fall at rotation, and the forward position of the thrust levers would no longer shield the cutoff switches.

  It's established fact both fuel control switches moved to CUTOFF 4 seconds after Vr, a deliberate guarded action, not easily done accidentally.
  <br/>
  The CVR records one pilot asking &ldquo;Why did you cut off?&rdquo;, the other replies &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t&rdquo;. Then a bland Mayday attributed to the Captain &ldquo;engine failure, returning&rdquo; in the middle of the crisis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The language, if reported correctly, feels strangely detached. No confusion, no urgency, no clear troubleshooting. Not drawing conclusions, but does anyone else see signs of performative behaviour, that is saying the right things outwardly, while being at odds with the underlying cause?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I appreciate that both crew members lost their lives, however if we avoid discussing uncomfortable patterns, we miss the point of investigation and learning.

  If anyone believes both guarded switches flipped to OFF by accident, one after the other in under a second, I&rsquo;d genuinely like to hear the cockpit ergonomics that make that plausible.

  I agree. Either this was an intentional act or it didn't happen at all. If there was some other defect that caused this, I cannot envisage a scenario where Boeing would survive a global grounding of 1200 x 787s. Plus the almost certain bankruptcy of Air India given the 787 is more than half their wide-body fleet.
