  That sure sounds like a RAT is deployed on that video, unless it\x92s a vehicle passing by.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I think I can somewhat see it deployed during the pitch up.

  I think it\x92s normal for most, even those with time on type, to point to the flap or gear lever issue. It was the same with the MAX until all the software issues came to light, the software was not really something top of mind, these machines are built and designed with precision, the thought of software causing havoc is somewhat implausible.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I think the discussion is at a standstill until we get more clarity on the flap position, and the RAT. The latter will become an issue for Boeing if that was extended, and they will need to work around the clock to prevent future mishaps, and reassure many flight op departments, especially those with early build 787s, that this is a isolated event.

     Numerous reports of cabin maintenance issues with Air India, if they can't fix the seats and IFE possibly they can't fix other things.
     <br/>
    </div>
   </div>

  This has been the norm for as long as I can remember, cycle back a decade they had been canabilising new aircraft for parts.

  I understand where Wilson wants to position AI, and he has done a lot of cleaning out and fixing, probably one of the biggest and hardest jobs in Aviation, but the cancer will always lie under the surface. He fixes and improves one thing, but uncovers ten more problems along the way, that\x92s the sort of beast AI is. It\x92s going to take time to get the Flight Ops and Engineering departments up to Singapore or Hong Kong standard.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This one was certainly due for a D check. I\x92d be interested to see the outstanding issues and the patch jobs. I can\x92t imagine it would be too flash under the cover, they might have improved engineering standards under Wilson\x92s watch, but the prior years would be questionable, even more so being a early build 787.

    I guess if no directives come from Boeing or the FAA in the next 2 weeks, it can be presumed that a systems failure from which recovery was impossible was unlikely.
   </div>
  </div>
  Possibly, but if it\x92s a problem that is due to negligence from say, the engineering department at Air India, then silence will likely continue while they go back in time trying to piece it together.

     selecting cutoff on the engines while in ground mode could be considered normal, but while flying it could sure use a second verifying prompt.

  The prompt is me sitting next to said persons cutting the switch saying \x91what the heck are you doing\x92.
