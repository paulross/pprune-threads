     That airport video shows an abrupt loss of lift with the aircraft pointing upwards the entire time which would explain (you know what). An engine failure would create some kind of yawing or change in pitch.

     Considering the RAT is 100% out as evidenced from footage both visually and audibly; the initial conclusion can only be both engines have failed, or one failed, and the other unfortunately shut down.

  I'm not convinced the RAT is out. I've looked several times and can't see it on any of the videos.

     Ok, so...

     But, what do flaps do in the event of a major hydraulic/electrical failure? Is there a default that they revert back to? I was under the impression the RAT can't power the flaps?
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  As far as I know the flaps will stay where they are if hydraulic power is lost. There is an electrical over ride function as a back up but I doubt the crew would have used that as it's a guarded switch.

     I have no knowledge about 787, but every landing gear system I\x92ve worked with did not sequence Left and Right MLG to retract and extend with each other. In fact it is typical for left and right side to move at slightly different speed due to different friction etc. Retraction assymmetry is probably not a clue to this mystery.
    </div>
   </div>

  The post you are replying to is completely wrong.
  <br/>
  The 787 landing gear is operated by the centre hydraulic system's two electric pumps.

  I have no idea why they have posted such nonsense.

     The RAT sounds to be deployed in some videos. Does the RAT deploy automatically on the B787?
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Please read this thread first before asking a question, it has been answered several times.
  <br/>
  Yes, the RAT will deploy automatically in the event of a loss of both AC Busses, both engines or all hydraulics.
  <br/>
  It can be deployed manually via a guarded push button switch on the overhead panel.

  Regarding flickering lights.
  <br/>
  The 787 has, as far as I know, a unique electrical system. When a light is selected on, either by pressing a button, flicking a switch or a touch screen selection there is no direct link to the lights. All instructions go through computers and are controlled by software.
  <br/>
  As a consequence lights are either off or on. A 'dicky' power supply as has been suggested by some will not cause the lights to flicker.
  <br/>
  This is not a 737.

     Speaking as a B787 Captain..... There is so much rubbish and stupid suggestion being written here.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     This aircraft was airborne for a grand total of 22 seconds, half of which was climbing to no more than 150' aal.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     - No Flaps? Due to the setup of the ECL it is physically impossible to go down the runway without some sort of take-off flap set. The T/o config warning would have been singing it's head off. Despite assertions to the contrary I have seen no video clear enough to detect a lack of flaps.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     - RAT out? Almost impossible, I have seen no quality footage that definitively witnesses the RAT being out. Those who think they car hear a RAT type noise might be listening to a motorcycle passing or similar. It takes a triple hydraulic failure or a double engine failure to trigger RAT deploment. They happily went through V1 without a hint of rejected take off so as they rotated the aircraft was serviceable. These are big engines, they take a long time to wind down when you shut them down. I have never tried it however engine failure detection takes 30s or for the aircraft to react and they were not even airborne that long.
     <br/>
     - Flaps up instead of gear? The B787 flaps are slow both in and out. Given that the 'Positive rate' call is not made the second the wheels leave the ground, a mis-selection of flaps up would not cause any loss of lift for at least 20 seconds, by which time they had already crashed. I believe the gear remained down not because of mis-selection but because of a major distraction on rotate.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Discounting the impossible, two hypotheses remain:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     1. Invalid derate set through incorrect cross-checking. Trundling down the runway takes very little power to reach Vr. It is only when you rotate that you create more drag and discover that you do not have sufficient thrust vs. drag to sustain a climb. Or....
     <br/>
     2. Put 200' as the altitude target in the FCU. Immediate ALT capture and all the power comes off. PF is still hand flying trying to increase pitch but is already way behind the aircraft.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     It could be after this that Boeing are forced to review the B787 practice of exploring the very edges of the performance envelope.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I have to agree with everything here except your assertion about engine shutdown.
  <br/>
  Even though these are big engines with plenty of inertia, when you select engine shut off they spool down very quickly if on load. IE, The generators, two per engine and hydraulic pumps, etc, being driven by the (relatively) small mass of the N2 rotor will drag the speed down very quickly, the gennies will trip offine in seconds, the pumps will quickly reduce flow and pressure.
  <br/>
  As for what went wrong.
  <br/>
  If the engines have stopped working there has to be a common failure mode, fuel is one but as has been said, no other aircraft has had a problem, as far as we know. FOD? It would have to be something major to shut down two GeNX engines and there would be debris all over the runway, we would know by now.
  <br/>
  I have no idea if the RAT has deployed, I can't see it in the video and the noise could be something else.
  <br/>
  We shall see.
  <br/>
  There is compelling evidence that flaps are set correctly and not retracted inadvertently.
  <br/>
  I await further evidence.
  <br/>
  Edit to add. LAE 40 years, type rated on 737 to 787 with lots of others in between.

  Good spot, but it is possible the actuator that operates the door is damaged.

  Unlikely, but possible.

  This does add more credance to the complete power loss scenario.

     Speaking as a B787 Captain..... There is so much rubbish and stupid suggestion being written here.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     This aircraft was airborne for a grand total of 22 seconds, half of which was climbing to no more than 150' aal.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     - No Flaps? Due to the setup of the ECL it is physically impossible to go down the runway without some sort of take-off flap set. The T/o config warning would have been singing it's head off. Despite assertions to the contrary I have seen no video clear enough to detect a lack of flaps.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     - RAT out? Almost impossible, I have seen no quality footage that definitively witnesses the RAT being out. Those who think they car hear a RAT type noise might be listening to a motorcycle passing or similar. It takes a triple hydraulic failure or a double engine failure to trigger RAT deploment. They happily went through V1 without a hint of rejected take off so as they rotated the aircraft was serviceable. These are big engines, they take a long time to wind down when you shut them down. I have never tried it however engine failure detection takes 30s or for the aircraft to react and they were not even airborne that long.
     <br/>
     - Flaps up instead of gear? The B787 flaps are slow both in and out. Given that the 'Positive rate' call is not made the second the wheels leave the ground, a mis-selection of flaps up would not cause any loss of lift for at least 20 seconds, by which time they had already crashed. I believe the gear remained down not because of mis-selection but because of a major distraction on rotate.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Discounting the impossible, two hypotheses remain:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     1. Invalid derate set through incorrect cross-checking. Trundling down the runway takes very little power to reach Vr. It is only when you rotate that you create more drag and discover that you do not have sufficient thrust vs. drag to sustain a climb. Or....
     <br/>
     2. Put 200' as the altitude target in the FCU. Immediate ALT capture and all the power comes off. PF is still hand flying trying to increase pitch but is already way behind the aircraft.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     It could be after this that Boeing are forced to review the B787 practice of exploring the very edges of the performance envelope.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I have to agree with everything here except your assertion about engine shutdown.
  <br/>
  Even though these are big engines with plenty of inertia, when you select engine shut off they spool down very quickly if on load. IE, The generators, two per engine and hydraulic pumps, etc, being driven by the (relatively) small mass of the N2 rotor will drag the speed down very quickly, the gennies will trip offine in seconds, the pumps will quickly reduce flow and pressure.
  <br/>
  As for what went wrong.
  <br/>
  If the engines have stopped working there has to be a common failure mode, fuel is one but as has been said, no other aircraft has had a problem, as far as we know. FOD? It would have to be something major to shut down two GeNX engines and there would be debris all over the runway, we would know by now.
  <br/>
  I have no idea if the RAT has deployed, I can't see it in the video and the noise could be something else.
  <br/>
  We shall see.
  <br/>
  There is compelling evidence that flaps are set correctly and not retracted inadvertently.
  <br/>
  I await further evidence.
  <br/>
  Edit to add. LAE 40 years, type rated on 737 to 787 with lots of others in between.

     There is at least one thing common to the TCMA on each engine: The TCMA software.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     My recollection may be inaccurate, but wasn't there something in the software for 787 generator control units that would cause generator shut down if the aircraft was 'powered up' for a continuous 248 days? Same software, so all 4 generators would shut down. Is my recollection inaccurate?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     What we do know, for sure, is that the TCMAs have the same 'authority' and effect as the fuel cut-off switches. The difference is that the crew control the latter.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I'm pretty sure the software is written independently. Same as Airbus, you don't want the same software error on duplicate critical systems.

       Thrust stayed fixed or decayed (if levers were moved).

       Speed decayed, aircraft climbed too steeply, energy bled off.

     Boeing SOPs typically include a callout at 400 ft like:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     "LNAV" - "VNAV" or "FLCH SPD"
     <br/>
     <br/>
     To ensure:
     <ul>
      <li>
       Proper navigation mode is active
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       Autothrottle resumes thrust management
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       Aircraft transitions smoothly into the climb phase
       <br/>
      </li>
     </ul>
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  But would any of that trigger the RAT and/or cause the emergency lights to come on? (I know, there is only anecdotal evidence from the sole survivor of this).

     I really think this is worth looking at. I keep asking a maintenance engineer to comment on what they'd do if a 787 with these issues presented itself to them on a turnaround shift and whether those faults could be connected to engine failure in some way.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  The short answer is no.
  <br/>
  The 787 has a very sophisticated diagnostic system. Faults are presented through a central maintenance computer system accessible either through the flight deck display units or from a laptop plugged in to the aircraft (there is a WiFi option but honestly it's a bit clunky and I've only ever used it once).
  <br/>
  All faults are displayed in ATA order as either active, not active or latched faults.
  <br/>
  I cannot see how any IFE, lighting, air con or other non power plant related faults could cause the situation that has brought this aircraft down.
  <br/>
  The IFE is entirely seperate and has its own independent diagnostic system.

     Once again, a question for people who know: what happens if voltage is applied to CLOSED coil of HPSOV when OPEN coil was already energized (dual conflicting inputs)?
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  The design is fail safe open.

     Draw your own conclusions.
     <br/>
     Personally, I trust there were no issues.

  Quite.
