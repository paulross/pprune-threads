     It seems pretty unlikely that a bird strike that took out both of those
     <i>
      very big
     </i>
     engines simultaneously would not have been fairly obvious in ways that nearby observers (e.g., the crew, ATC, airport personnel?) would have noticed. Possible, of course, but I don't think we've seen any evidence that points in that direction. Also, for what it's worth, the
     <i>
      Times of London

     " cited here in the closed thread includes this:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     A poster in the closed thread pointed out, properly I think, that the
     <i>
      Times
     </i>
     shouldn't be relied upon for presentation or interpretation of technical information. Like most general news organizations, their reporters and editors (mostly) just don't have the background to assess, filter and explain complex processes and technology. Unlike many, though, the
     <i>
      Times
     </i>
     can generally be relied upon to seek appropriate sources and report accurately what those sources say. I think it's very likely that Indian authorities
     <i>
      have
     </i>
     ruled out a bird strike, and I also think those authorities are competent to make that decision.

  Thanks for straightening me out on that one. Strange though that bird strike theory was ruled out so quickly without examining the wreckage or hearing the CVR? And still, the video potentially shows an right engine surge on the runway. If not a bird strike, then for what reason? Maybe I'm just seeing things since no one else seems to see this so I'll leave it there.

  The second box has been recovered and the CVR is being analyzed so hopefully they will give an interim update shortly.

  As regards the pixelation in the take off image that you posted, I'd say that is certainly well spotted, but I think we all have to acknowledge that pixelation really denotes the
  <i>
   absence'
  </i>
  of information rather than it's presence. I would say that if this image were followed by indications of asymmetric thrust and an irregular take off and initial climb, it would tell us something, even in the absence of bird remains. But it didn't, and the aircraft took off with all appearing normal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To me, the video shows that whatever happened to the aircraft was symmetrical in as far as it continued in an (almost) straight line. That said, it is entirely possible that however grainy the video evidence is, somewhere within it there may well be a significant - even if momentary - clue, so this was a good catch, even if not the smoking gun.

     Once upon a time. I've had my own words in a Wikipedia edit [1] crop up in a Sunday Times biographical article a couple of weeks later, copy-and-paste. The worrying thing about this is that the Sunday Times article then becomes the "cite" that validates the initial claim.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     [1] because I had got fed up with the inaccuracies. You may also thank me for correcting nonsense about fuel levels on Apollo 11, just before the 50th anniversary articles all started using Wikipedia as their starting point.

  I don't find your experience with the
  <i>
   Times
  </i>
  overly surprising.  Sloppy research and reporting makes its way into the best news publications, which is why I was careful to use the modifier "generally" in the post you quoted. Copying and pasting from Wiki without attribution is certainly egregious.   Still, I feel comfortable with the assumption that the
  <i>
   Times/Sunday Times
  </i>
  does indeed
  <i>
   generally
  </i>
  follow good journalistic practices.  I accept that the reporter(s) did speak with "Indian authorities" and that those authorities did tell the reporter(s) that a bird strike had been ruled out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As I said, I'm also pretty confident that the Indian authorities are competent to determine whether there was a bird strike.  It would be fair to ask whether I'd be confident in that if they told the reporters that there
  <i>
   was
  </i>
  a bird strike or that they hadn't ruled it out.  I'd have to admit that I'd probably have some difficulty with that, given that I think it would be obvious to
  <i>
   us
  </i>
  , even with as little evidence we have so far, if birds had taken out those engines.  But I hope I wouldn't be too sure that I'm right and they were wrong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And yes, thanks for correcting those fuel levels.  I'd want them to be right if I consulted that Wiki entry.  I often use Wikipedia as a starting place, but I remember that it's an encyclopedia and if I have more than a passing interest in the material of an entry, I follow and assess the cited sources there before reaching any conclusions.

     OK, I promised some
     <b>
      <span style="color:#c0392b">
       informed speculation
      </span>
     </b>
     when I got back, so here goes:
     <br/>
     Disclaimer: never worked the 787, so my detailed knowledge is a bit lacking.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     First off, this is perplexing - especially if the RAT was deployed. There is no 'simple' explanation that I can come up with.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     GEnx-1B engines have been exceptionally reliable, and the GE carbon composite fan blades are
     <i>
      very
     </i>
     robust and resistant to bird strike damage (about 15 years after the GE90 entry into service, I remember a GE boast that no GE90 (carbon composite) fan blades had needed to be scrapped due to damage (birdstrike, FOD, etc. - now that was roughly another 15 years ago, so is probably no longer true, but it shows just how robust the carbon composite blades are - far better than the more conventional titanium fan blades).
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Not saying it wasn't somehow birdstrike related, just that is very unlikely (then again, all the other explanations I can come up with are also very unlikely
     <img alt="" border="0" class="inlineimg" src="https://www.pprune.org/images/smilies2/icon_rolleyes.gif" title="Roll Eyes (Sarcastic)"/>
     ).
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Using improper temp when calculating TO performance - after some near misses, Boeing added logic that cross-compares multiple total temp probes - aircraft TAT (I think the 787 uses a single, dual element probe for aircraft TAT, but stand to be corrected) and the temp measured by the engine inlet probes - and puts up a message if they disagree by more than a few degree tolerance - so very, very unlikely.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     N1 power setting is somewhat less prone to measurement and power setting errors than EPR (N1 is a much simpler measurement than Rolls EPR) - although even with EPR, problems on both engines at the same time is almost unheard of.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The Auto Thrust (autothrottle) function 'falls asleep' at 60 knots - and doesn't unlock until one of several things happens - 250 knots, a set altitude AGL is exceeded (I'm thinking 3,000 ft. but the memory is fuzzy), thrust levers are moved more than a couple of degrees, or the mode select is changed (memory says that last one is inhibited below 400 ft. AGL). So an Auto Thrust malfunction is also extremely unlikely. Further, a premature thrust lever retard would not explain a RAT deployment.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     TO does seem to be very late in the takeoff role - even with a big derate, you still must accelerate fast enough to reach V1 with enough runway to stop - so there is still considerable margin if both engines are operating normally. That makes me wonder if they had the correct TO power setting - but I'm at a loss to explain how they could have fouled that up with all the protections that the 787 puts on that.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     If one engine did fail after V1, it's conceivable that they shut down the wrong engine - but since this happened literally seconds after takeoff, it begs the question why they would be in a big hurry to shut down the engine. Short of an engine fire, there is nothing about an engine failure that requires quick action to shut it down - no evidence of an engine fire, and even with an engine fire, you normally have minutes to take action - not seconds.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <span style="color:#c0392b">
      <b>
       The one thing I keep thinking about is someone placing both fuel switches to cutoff immediately after TO.
      </b>
     </span>
     Yes, it's happened before (twice - 767s in the early 1980s), but the root causes of that mistake are understood and have been corrected. Hard to explain how it could happen (
     <b>
      <span style="color:#c0392b">
       unless, God forbid, it was intentional
      </span>
     </b>
     ).

  I think it's not a coincidence that
  <a href="https://www.pprune.org/accidents-close-calls/666581-air-india-ahmedabad-accident-12th-june-2025-part-2-a.html#post11903414" target="_blank">

  I read the whole threads, keeping my hands on the mousewheel so far since I'm not a pilot, just a EE / safety / systems engineer.
  <br/>
  The hamsterwheel ist spinning a lot here, and of course it could be anything including some VHDL FPGA code line or a broken RAM cell in a cheap memory bar within the computer it was compiled with. Anything is possible, but to be honest: development processes, if followed, are usually pushing the probability to a level where it becomes pure theory. BOSCH uses FPGA+\xb5C on the brake control box of cars. They sold 100 millions of those, used 4000h each (car lifetime) without error, with less strict development process. Most errors are made on requirement level, not code.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also, so far there is no evidence I've seen regarding the 'chicken-egg' problem, did the engines fall below idle (fuel, stall...) and this caused an electrical blackout (-&gt; battery, RAT...) or did an EE problem cause the engines to reduce thrust (FADEC, SW bug...). And where is the common cause in all this?
  <br/>
  There has to be a systematic error common to both engines, an external failure affecting both or a dependent fault with one affecting the other within seconds. This is the only thing I think everyone agrees here. And I refuse to beleave the external failure or dependent fault was sitting in the cockpit.
  <br/>
  I think it is something not common to every aircraft type for the last 50 years.
  <br/>
  So I started searching and found a candidate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I read myself into the EE architecture of this unique 'bleed-less' design and it's megawatt powergrid since this is the part where I may be able to contribute (and I'm most curious about). Generators on the 787 are &gt;250kW instead of &lt;100kW each and there are two per engine instead of just one. In fact, they can go up to 516 kW and shear off the gearbox at &gt;2200Nm (equal to &gt;2 MW, per generator).
  <br/>
  <a href="https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/downloads/7641/en" target="_blank">
   https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/downloads/7641/en
  </a>
  (page 11)
  <br/>
  So while on any other aircraft the generator is more like the dynamo on your bicycle, those generators are massive (x10).
  <br/>
  The gearbox is connected to the HP shaft (N2) on the GEnx. I learned from Wikipedia that RR moved this gearbox to the IP shaft on the Trend 1000. And RR is happy that the A330neo Trend 7000 uses bleed air and less load on the gearbox, since this maintains stability on the HP shaft at light load (also Wikipedia).
  <br/>
  Those generators are not in phase and frequency sync, or in other words: If you parallel them, they fight each other, it's like a short. They will almost block if this is not handled by the control box if possible (or some melting fuse blows at some point).
  <br/>
  <a href="https://www.pprune.org/tech-log/631129-787-electrical-system-variable-frequency-generators.html#post10735455" target="_blank">
   787 electrical system - variable frequency generators?
  </a>
  <br/>
  Somehow I find it hard to believe that they are not able to disturb the engines despite that everyone here so far is claiming that there is no way an electrical problem could influence them because FADEC has it's own supply. I read that one is sufficent to start the engine, usually both are used.
  <br/>
  In my mind I find lot's of ways this could influence both engines simultanously. If just the BTBs on the 230V grid got some humidity (hot, no AC, water cooling...) and went up in one big arc (I think they made them semiconductor relays, too).
  <br/>
  Could those gearboxes and engines handle 4500Nm / almost 5 MW on each HP shaft, applied within a fraction of a second without any problem?
  <br/>
  Or if the engines were in a condition not far from compressor stall, one was stalling and 400kW load jumped from one engines generators to the other...
  <br/>
  I did some rough estimation and one of the generators could push N2 below idle in a second or less without fuel just with its normal 250kW load (just inertia).
  <br/>
  This is one point which is unique to this airplane model, so maybe worth a closer look.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I know that those engines are burning at &gt;100MW at full power, but how fragile in the balance between compressor load and this one turbine stage on the HP shaft / N2, without the inertia of a 2.8 meter fan? This is just out of my background, any thermodynamic expert here?
  <br/>
  Of course I also have no insight in SW and communication within the control boxes, how much they are talking to each other, delaying/ramping load redistribution etc. If FADEC recognizes a flameout, could it instantly command the generators to cut the load, even above idle rpm?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I would assume that some fuel contamination, valve blockade, even compressor stall would pop up slower. But such a generator could kick in within milliseconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As a safety guy I learned that one tends to look first at things one is familiar with (SW, HW, mechanics, pilot behaviour, maintainance, depending on one's profession) and in the end it's often the interface and dependent faults within which are not carefully considered (e.g. takeoff situation vs. thermodynamics vs. mechanics vs. power generation vs. humidity vs. generator control...) together with transient behaviour. It was the same with MCAS (safety culture vs. pilot training vs. SW design (repeated action) vs. single AOA input vs. bird strike probability close to ground vs. trim loading/blockade vs. stickshaker noise/distraction).
  <br/>
  In fact, I was trying to find information on all those systems and directly found slides on how the engines and generators could be simulated and the power grid tested in a HIL (hardware in the loop) environment. My experience from automotive is that such simulated environments are often far from reality and HIL environment programming finished after the product is already at the customer. But of course its far easier and cheaper to apply and test faults there. But then, some programmer programms what he thinks the reaction of the engine would be.
  <br/>
  This 'bleed-less' design was some massive change in airplane EE architecture with hugh consequences on the whole airplane design and extremely hard to fully analyze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I'm just asking questions and hope that we all learn a lot and this was fully considered or just not an issue. It's just an aspect I found worth mentioning and not only spinning the wheel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  PS: I doubt it was TCMA. The air/ground decision is done in a different box, evaluating 5 inputs in a 1/3 and 1/2 decision according to this discussion. This is then safely sent to the FADEC (as one input) and combined with the thrust lever position and N2. But if the thrust lever position is sensed (redundant and direct) close to idle, you do not need TCMA or ground mode to expect reduced thrust.
