  Personally I think take off flaps are extended. It's a grainy video but if you compare it to a normal 787 take off, you can see the profile is similar. The 787 has a sleek wing, even with take off flap deployed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 787 screams blue murder at you if you take off without flap. I think selecting flaps up instead of gear up is also unlikely.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The gear not being retracted could be due to confusion in the cockpit/workload.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I'm thinking perhaps a take off performance mis-calculation and/or power issue.

  Having now seen the \x93airport video\x94 it does look as if the aircraft climbs normally initially before losing climb rate, around the same sort of time the pilot flying would call for gear up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I have to say, inadvertently selecting flaps 5 to flaps 1 instead of raising the gear does seem the most logical cause given what we see on the footage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That, or some issue causing lack of thrust from both engines, which is arguably just as unlikely.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The dust cloud is a little odd but I\x92m not familiar with the airport. That may be normal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  787\x92s have the longest take off runs in modern day aviation and it\x92s possible they don\x92t frequent that airport.

  Having now heard the sound of the RAT from another video to compare the crash video to, I am convinced it\x92s deployed in the crash video, and I can\x92t see anything else other than a catastrophic power failure being the cause.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As to what has caused that, no idea, very sad.

     Standard SLF disclaimer goes here-

     I\x92m +1 for the RAT theory- having watched the video numerous times on phone speakers and headphones, the noise as the aircraft flies over the balcony is very strongly reminiscent of hearing T-6s (fast propeller aircraft) at an air cadet camp at Valley a few years back and, having recently been at the Frankfurt airport viewing deck, nowhere close to the noise I\x92ve heard from a departing Dreamliner. They\x92re quiet aircraft but not that quiet!
     <br/>
     <br/>
     One more pondering and I apologise for this\x85 a recent BA flight into LHR had the captain rapidly flashing the seatbelt sign during his welcome announcement, explaining that if he did this we should return to our seats immediately. Eyewitness testimony is famously unreliable, and the \x91flickering\x92 of the green exit lights could mean many different things. Dreamliner drivers, you are the experts. Is it plausible that the flight deck crew could have tried to flash the emergency lights in lieu of a \x91brace for impact\x92 call similar to the ONA ditching in the Caribbean?
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  No.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Flashing the seatbelt lights to get people back to their seat quicker, while somewhat unreliable, is for doing exactly that.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is not to tell the passengers to brace for impact! That\x92s ridiculous.

  Can any 787 drivers confirm if TCMA would/could activate if a pilot were to inadvertently cause unusual and/or asymmetric thrust with the levers after V1 and through VR (before being airborne)?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I.e. if there was some hesitation in aborting TO, could a few seconds at high power with somewhat asymmetric levers have caused TCMA to activate?
