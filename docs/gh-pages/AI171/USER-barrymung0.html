  Ok, so...
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some have said the RAT appears to have been deployed. This would suggest a hydraulic/electrical failure on the plane.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A hydraulic/electrical failure could well make it impossible to retract the gear immediately.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But, what do flaps do in the event of a major hydraulic/electrical failure? Is there a default that they revert back to?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  We can, I think, rule out engine failure, at least single engine failure because the rudder is still straight on in the
  <br/>
  Video. You can also hear the engines..

     Given the sound which clearly mimics the RAT, images and collective tech knowledge, what could lead to this symmetric loss of thrust/lift at 200ft?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Fuel supply/quality issues?

  Gear unable to be retracted and flaps retracted due to no hydraulic pressure? It would certainly explain the RAT being deployed and the loss of lift.

     You are saying the RAT is deployed but we can rule out engine failure?
     <br/>

     I thought this was meant to the *professional* pilot\x92s forum

  Well, the certainly sound like they are working; failed engines sound different. No sign of smoke or damage either.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Conceivably, it could be a double engine failure but that's very unlikely.

  The chances of a double engine failure on take off are like a billion to one, and I think are certified to a million to one occurrence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As you say they still provide power and pressure even if not running
