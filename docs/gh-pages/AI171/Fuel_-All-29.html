     3 possibilities come to mind:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     1. Pilot who moved fuel switches to off did not do so intentionally to cause the outcome, but for some reason unknown.............somehow confused the action of retracting gear with shutdown procedure at end of flight..
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  This crossed my mind too. This is called an "action-slip" by designers: a valid and frequently practised action being applied to entirely the wrong situation, resulting in an (extremely) invalid action.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On this flight, the relative drop in noise and calm that follows the landing gear doors closing after the gear retracts during the initial climb, might have caused an action slip by PIC to perform the engine shut-down procedure used when parking on stand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Unlikely though, I would hope.

     There is a lot of grasping at straws in this thread. It seems pretty simple to me and only one explanation that fits the evidence. About three seconds after takeoff the Captain noted the FO turn of the fuel cutoff switches. He immediately questioned that for obvious reasons and the FO replied he did not again for reasons that seem obvious to me. He did not want it on the tape and he wanted to delay the Captain in trying to switch them back on. Had the fuel cutoff switches been restored immediately before the engines unspooled the accident would have been avoided. In addition the timing of the cutoff switches movement is exactly what you would expect if the copilot was using one hand trying to be discreet in his actions.

  The prelim report does not attribute any actions or conversational elements to any individual.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The prelim report makes clear that the right seat is PF and the left seat is PM.
  <br/>

  IMO you should delete this post.

  Has anyone answered whether there is any message when the engine CutOff switches are transitioned in this situation?

  Where on Earth do you guys get the understanding the FO moved the switches? The FO is PF. His hands are on the yoke. Likely both of them.

  Just read all 16 pages - been flying! I think comment \x93why did you cutoff\x94 is not the reaction I would expect from a Training Captain who has just witnessed the co-pilot turn both fuel control switches off. They would possibly utter an exclamation, but would surely correct the error immediately - this didn\x92t happen for 10secs. The words are more likely to have come from an FO who has both hands on the control column and is concentrating on the rotation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Every flight we do as PM we move both fuel control switches to cutoff, 1 after the other, with a gap of about 1 sec between each one. It\x92s a learnt action in response to the phrase \x93shutdown\x94.
  <br/>
  Every sim the TC has conducted he will have moved critical switches without much thought in order to setup the sim for the exercise. I remember being slightly shocked one day on the aircraft, having been training in the sim the previous day, that I nearly operated a critical control without thought. It\x92s something I had to consciously guard against after that.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There is no rational explanation for doing it though - moving both fuel control switches down instead of moving the gear lever up is not a likely action slip. It seems either a totally subconscious act or a totally deliberate act.

  Engine shutdown/restart.
  <br/>
  As Captains of Boeing twins, which fuel switch do you typically move first, Eng 1 or Eng 2?
  <br/>
  As First Officers, same question.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Higher probability that the PM (Captain) manipulated the switches given the sequence of events.

      This might have been discussed but as has been suggested upthread; a possible scenario is that at some point, PIC took their hands off the thrust levers and/or placed them in a guarding position behind the thrust levers at their base - but by doing so unfortunately nudged the Fuel cut-off switches to 'Off' - perhaps 'helped' by there either being incorrectly fitted locking mechanisms or worn locking mechanisms ?

  Come on! The gear never moved! You're an Airbus pilot; do you really think that could happen? If so, would the captain then sit there fat, dumb and happy wondering what was now going on... for 10 seconds? Even I would say "Sh1t" and whip those fuel switches back on quicker than the FO could say "WTF!".

     It's established fact both fuel control switches moved to CUTOFF 4 seconds after Vr, a deliberate guarded action, not easily done accidentally.
     <br/>
     The CVR records one pilot asking \x93Why did you cut off?\x94, the other replies \x93I didn\x92t\x94. Then a bland Mayday attributed to the Captain \x93engine failure, returning\x94 in the middle of the crisis.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The language, if reported correctly, feels strangely detached. No confusion, no urgency, no clear troubleshooting. Not drawing conclusions, but does anyone else see signs of performative behaviour, that is saying the right things outwardly, while being at odds with the underlying cause?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I appreciate that both crew members lost their lives, however if we avoid discussing uncomfortable patterns, we miss the point of investigation and learning.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  in that fraught moment of engines not functioning very close to the ground, the last thing to do at this critical moment when you don\x92t really known what has happened is communicate a MayDay. With the buildings looming up fast, the action required is to attempt to restart, as seems to have been done by a pilot putting the fuel switch to \x93run\x94, but too late to rescue aircraft. I think the timing of the MayDay call is strange given that the scenario called for Aviate, Navigate\x85 then Communicate.

  I would suspect that if intentional the pilot who shut the engines down would guard the switches until he was sure the desired result was obtained. There would also be an extreme startle factor in this case. If I saw the PM hands in that area I also would not have immediately questioned that until I observed the engines spooling down.

  Firstly, 10 seconds is a more than reasonable time for startle factor to impair cognition (as discussed repeatedly). Secondly, why do so many people assume it was the FO that moved the cutoff switches? He was PF, I find it more likely that the PM moved the switches (for whatever reason).

     the RAT can be deployed manually, and I believe a pilot did that here before power was lost.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I don't think this answers my question? Evidently there is an interruption in power, the (quite stable, at that point) ADS-B stream cuts out and doesn't return for the final twenty seconds of flight. And there are other indications that non-essential loads were shed, like the survivor remembering what must have been emergency exit lighting in the cabin. Though I would have liked explicit confirmation of AC power loss happening or not in the report.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The timing of data loss seemingly lining up with the first cutoff switch being flipped back to RUN seems a little too coincidental to me, but again hopefully someone with relevant knowledge has a mundane explanation for this.

     10 seconds to respond is a long long time if you\x92ve just made a silly mistake, you\x92d have those switches back on in a second. The startle factor isn\x92t really a factor here, because you

  Regardless of what actually happened in that cockpit, reasoning like this seems completely backwards to me. Since when do humans reliably, instantly recognise that they've just made a mistake? If they were
  <i>
   that
  </i>
  attuned to their actions they're almost certainly attuned enough to
  <i>
   not
  </i>
  make the mistake in the first place, especially if we're talking about an action slip. I've e.g. absentmindedly added salt to my tea instead of sugar and I certainly didn't immediately realise that I'd done that - in fact it took a good few seconds even after sipping and spitting it out for my brain to catch up to what must have happened. Even if an observer had pointed out to me before drinking it that my tea had salt in it, I would just have been confused because
  <i>
   obviously
  </i>
  I wouldn't do something that silly (spoiler alert: I did).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On top of that I feel like people are overestimating how long ten seconds actually is, especially considering some of those seconds are reported to have been taken up by confused dialogue (that isn't even reported in its entirety). I thought it was common wisdom that accidents are never down to one thing; it would be light-years from being the first time that suboptimal crew response turned a maybe-recoverable error into a definite disaster without an ounce of malice in the mix.

       As per the EAFR data both engines N2 values passed below minimum idle speed, and the

     <br/>
     <br/>
     It suggests to me that the RAT deployment was initiated while the engines were still above idle and generating electrical power. Obviously one of the pilots could have done it via depressing the switch, as it's a "dual engine failure/stall" memory item (see
     <a href="https://www.pprune.org/accidents-close-calls/666581-air-india-ahmedabad-accident-12th-june-2025-part-2-a-70.html#post11918946" target="_blank">

     <br/>

     Is there a way for the RAT to deploy while the engines are still above idle?
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Loss of hydraulics or electrics will auto deploy the rat. The timing to me however seems to match up with when the engines were selected off.

  If the thrust levers were found in idle but, according to the EAFR, were set to TO thrust until the end, doesn\x92t that also raise further questions? I mean: Of course, the impact causes compression at the nose, but the centrifugal forces act in the opposite direction. So, if there is an objective inconsistency here, and we have a pilot who says he did not operate the fuel cut-off switches, while the EAFR indicates otherwise, then we have yet another inconsistency.

  Deliberate pilot action should be ruled out until any evidence and motivation for why that's the case emerges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All we know is the fuel cut off switches were flipped to Cutoff for 10 seconds and then to run again. Not how or by what. The focus should be on how this could occur. Accidentally, technical malfunction, a foreign object somehow hitting and moving them or other reason?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Theories needs to be tested in a cockpit with the exact configuration of this aircraft and with the angles and forces involved as much as we can. It should be possible to simulate it pretty closely and whatever happened should be repeatable. It's going to be something extremely unlikely, or we'd have seen it before in 10 years of 787 service.
