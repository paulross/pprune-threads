     It isn't. It's essentially just a CVR and FDR in the same box. The main USP is that you now have two of each, about as far apart from each other as possible on the aircraft.

     Each is downloaded separately in pretty much the same way as always.

  Given the number of times I reviewed DFDR data supplied by an operator after some sort of event/incident, I think most major operators have access to the equipment needed to download a healthy data recorder.  So I'd be a bit surprised if Air India does not have this capability.
  <span style="color:#222222">
   OldnGrounded has also posted that the Indian AAIB also has that ability.
  </span>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Usually when I hear of data recorders going back to the US NTSB or the recorder manufacturer, it's because the crash damage is such that specialized equipment is needed to download the data.  The recorder in the tail would likely have little damage.
  <br/>
  While the AAIB
  <i>
   may
  </i>
  have held off on downloading the recorders until all the major players are present, it's been several days - I'd expect everyone who matters is already there.  So I think it is reasonable to believe that the investigators have done a download and have had at least a preliminary look at the data.  If there is a smoking gun, they probably already know (and the longer we don't hear something regarding the rest of the 787 fleet, or at least the GEnx powered fleet, the less likely it is that they suspect a systemic problem with the aircraft and/or engine).  However the proviso that I posted earlier about potential data loss/corruption due to a sudden shutdown still applies - so maybe the data simply isn't on the recorder.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As has already been posted, EMI is highly unlikely - the current cert requirements for HIRF are quite high, and due to the composite airframe construction of the 787, the lighting requirements are much higher than for conventional aluminum aircraft (the higher resistance of the composite airframe results is higher lightning induced currents).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  FDR has suggested a large slug of water hitting critical aircraft electronics at rotation - it is possible that resultant electrical short circuits could falsely signal the engines that the switches are in cutoff.  Highly unlikely that it would do that to both engines, but possible.
  <br/>
  Then again, all the other plausible explanations are highly unlikely, so...
  <br/>
  <br/>
  BTW, I do have a life outside PPRuNe - and I'm going to be traveling the next several days, with limited to non-existent internet access.  So don't be surprised if I'm not responding posts or PMs.

     Lead Balloon: "Yet the (a?) patent application for the TCMA addition to the EEC was filed by Boeing."
     <br/>
     <br/>
     That sounds right, since it's an airframe related issue, not specific to the engine.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Your other implied question, ie: Is the TCMA software part of the FADEC , or something Boeing designed and built. Or, where is that functionality resident in the system, and who designed and built it ?. Starting to think that this tragedy may have had a far more subtle cause than has been imagined thus far.

  Boeing's patent application says:

  My understanding is that "EEC" is Boeing for "FADEC".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But I have to reiterate, and as others have noted, that we don't know what actual TCMA systems, if any, were fitted where and how it was wired into the accident aircraft's engines, or whether the specific state of the TCMA systems, if any, were monitored by the flight recorders.

    The government said in a statement that the decision on where the decoding of the recorders would take place would be made after India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) has made a "due assessment" of all technical, safety and security considerations.

    AAIB's Director General GVG Yugandhar told Reuters earlier in an emailed response that the Economic Times report was "factually incorrect", but gave no further details.

     SLF Engineer(electrical -not aerospace) so no specialised knowledge of any kind.
     <br/>
     The TCMA discussions on here seem clear that in normal operation the TCMA functions should not
     <br/>
     operate in air mode and the TCMA has multiple inputs from various sensors (Rad alts, WOW sensors).
     <br/>
     My query is to how these signals are routed to the engines, are they compared/aggregated in or routed through
     <br/>
     the EE bays. If they are present in the EE bays then fdr's idea of a water leak at rotate into the EE bays
     <br/>
     could generate shorts from the HV buses to the TCMA units.
     <br/>
     Are the TCMA units designed to cope with 400V AC inputs where a low voltage input is expected.
     <br/>
     I appreciate that the TCMA has to physically power a valve closed but applying high voltage to low voltage
     <br/>
     logic circuitry might have unexpected consequences.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  The TCMA runs on the FADECs (Full Authority Digital Engine Control). There is one per engine, located inside the nacelle. Each one has a dual channel design inside, to compare computations, inputs etc. and generally provide redundancy (but I don\x92t know further details on the design/logic).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The sensors and actuators related to that engine (pressure, temperature sensors, various valves etc.) are most likely directly connected to it. The two throttle position sensors per engine are also directly cabled to it according to tdracer. No idea how other inputs like WoW and RADALT are connected. The FADECs don\x92t necessarily need much else, as apparently Autopilot etc. always move the actual thrust lever.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There must also be a communication channel back to the flight recorders. No idea if it gets thrown into a comms bus or there is direct wiring.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In terms of power, each FADEC has its own alternator driven by the engine. But there\x92s a failover connection to the AC bus of the plane. Not sure if there\x92s a physical relay keeping it disconnected in normal operations.

  slf/ppl here - with a respectable amount of experience in software delivery for real-time/embedded/safety critical systems. Software development in this area really is an engineering discipline and bears no resemblance to common practice in other areas. Couple that with the requirements for function duplication/triplication, harness separation et al then IMHO the chances of FADEC etc software errors are effectively zero.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I'm commenting to make that point but also to link the videos and the FR-24 dataset - (below with my deltas for height/time added)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <img alt="" class="post_inline_image" src="https://cimg8.ibsrv.net/gimg/pprune.org-vbulletin/925x253/ai_171_fr24_b126bd313caffdd4c8285365be7bc89d5fc355ef.png"/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <i>
   Extract from FR24 csv dataset
  </i>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As noted in both threads to date everything was normal until it wasn't - the two values for fpm above are subject to FR24 variance of +/- 25' so even these suggest a normal climb at this stage of flight ca 2,000fpm. FR24 Lat/Longs all follow the centre line.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On this data the climb stops at around 70' AGL and electrical failure around 2s later. Again, as noted in the threads, this aligns with when gear up might have been expected. If the climb stopped because of fuel shutoff then 2s for spool down to electrical failure isn't out of the question.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Looking at the two videos.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CCTV video indicates a total flight time, from rotation, of about 32s, subjectively levelling off ~14s after rotation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rooftop video has a flight time ~14s suggesting the video starts ~18s after rotation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rooftop video evidences the RAT as deployed from the beginning - meaning it must have been deployed by at least 16s after rotation - which aligns with the ADS-B indicated electrical failure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If the forward flight recorder really is being sent to the US for recovery then it's reasonable to assume that the rear recorder contains nothing after the electrical failure and they are hoping the forward recorder captured something from the cockpit in the final 16s.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I don't have any experience of flight deck CRM but I don't see how those timings allow problem identification/misidentification and subsequent action - ie it wasn't down to the crew.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The maximum aircraft height in the CCTV video, as judged by wingspan, appears higher than 71' - though it is certainly less than a wingspan height at the beginning of the rooftop video.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I haven't seen, in the threads, any statement of what happens on the flight deck with a total electrical failure - is it a 4s blackout whilst the RAT deploys and systems restart? - or are there batteries that keep something alive?

    The government body investigating the Air India Boeing 787-8 crash in Ahmedabad last week will take a decision on where the black box data will be decoded \x93after due assessment of all technical, safety, and security considerations,\x94 the Ministry of Civil Aviation said on Thursday (June 19, 2025).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The statement said two different sets of black boxes were recovered from the crash site, one on June 13 and another on June 16. Each black box unit comprises the Digital Flight Data Recorder (DFDR) and Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR).

    A government official closely involved with the probe said there would be a preliminary report. Interestingly, during the only other airline crash investigated by the AAIB (which was formed in 2012), after the Mangalore crash of May 2010 \x97 i.e. Calicut accident \x97 only the final report was published within a year.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Officials, past and present, explained that the rules under which the AAIB carries out an investigation do not specify a timeline for a preliminary report, even though the UN aviation safety watchdog, the International Civil Aviation Organisation\x92s Annex 13 requires one within 30 days. A similar rule is not part of the Aircraft (Investigation of Accidents and Incidents) Rules, 2017 formed under the principal law, the Bharatiya Vayuyan Vidheyak, 2024.
    <br/>
    (...)
    <br/>
    One of the above mentioned officials said the Calicut probe team didn\x92t release a preliminary report because the Rules don\x92t lay down a timeline for it and require such a report to only categorise the nature of the mishap. He added that the team involved in the drafting of the Rules held the opinion that such a report could be vastly different from the final investigation report, which may result in public criticism and media backlash.

     According to this BBC article (from 3hrs ago), the Indian AAIB is
     <b>

  The Ministry of Civil Aviation has denied reports that the black boxes from the Air India plane crash are being sent overseas. The \x93Black Box Lab\x94 under India\x92s Civil Aviation Ministry is currently analysing the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder retrieved from the wreckage of the ill-fated Air India AI-171 flight. ( This must be the Rs 90 million allegedly state-of-the-art facility at Udaan Bhawan [ with the assistance of Hindustan Aeronautics Limited ], New Delhi which was ready on 9th April 2025 - shouldn't it be more appropriate for DGCA / MoCA to get needed expertise, if at all, to their Delhi facility ASAP ? ).

  The situation with reading the flight recorders seem increasingly suspicious to me.  As of yesterday, they're still dithering about whether to send them to the USA?  Is this about India not wanting to reveal their smart new facility can't do the job?  Or unwillingness to trust the US/Boeing?  Or some other kind of argument? It seems ridiculous to me that no decision has been made about the boxes nine days after the crash and the rapidly discovered recorders.

    India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) is yet to decide whether flight data and cockpit voice recorders from the Air India flight that crashed last Thursday will be sent overseas for decoding and analysis. {remove crash generalities} Some media outlets reported that the black boxes are being sent abroad, but the ministry of civil aviation clarified that no final decision has been made.The ministry
    <a href="https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2137718" target="_blank">
     said

    the AAIB will determine the location for analysis after a "due assessment of technical, safety, and security factors".
   </div>
  </div>
  I will defend their investigating team, and the release of information time line, based on at least these points:
  <br/>
  1. They'd rather do things deliberately, and get it right, than to make a slight rush and get something wrong (even a little bit wrong)
  <br/>
  2. The political leadership are sensitive to how the information age, and social media, amplifies even the slightest misstatement.
  <br/>
  3. If they can do it in house then why not do it in house? Why add further delay by transferring the recorder and risk accidents in handling during transit?
  <br/>
  4. They are under a timeline set by ICAO, not the time line that your, or my, or "the public's" hunger for information and impatience sets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Let's give them the benefit of the doubt.

  Different (older) aircraft, the flight recorders there did not have backup power iirc.

     in my first reply, I started typing, but then removed, 'one thing missing in the FDR's disaster survivability requirements, is 'politics resistance'. Not implying that in this case, except for some face saving moves, the 'thruth' is in danger.

  I had thought consideration for the preservation of truth might underlie India's reluctance to send the flight recorders across the Pacific Ocean. But it could simply be that the foreign accident boards and India have different opinions on how trustworthy India's flight recorder lab is. Negotiations ensue? Anyway, this is idle speculation on my part.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While impatient media might lament the delay, I think it is right that some time is spent on ensuring that the end result of the investigation is trustworthy. Even if that involves diplomacy.

  Two minor points regarding competence and who gets the task of data extraction from the data recorders: Firstly, that it's the AAIB (India) which will decide where and when to hand over the data recorders, and secondly, the supposed comment attributed to the Ministry of Civil Aviation in the press release dated June 19 (
  <a href="https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2137718" target="_blank">
