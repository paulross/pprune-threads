  650 feet was mentioned. Can anyone confirm if that was height or altitude? (And what airfield elevation is)

  Looking at the new video and seeing the time airborne I doubt there was time for a mayday call, unless maybe the Captain became incapacitated, has the mayday call been verified?

  In summary,
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Flaps were extended, possibly flaps 5 or 15. Looks like it in the video and clearly shown post crash.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Aircraft reached a height of just over 100\x92 AGL (possibly 200\x92 if you compare wingspan to height in videos)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  RAT was deployed. Seen on videos and heard conclusively.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Aircraft rotated at \x91usual\x92 spot. Comparing FR24 data from previous flights over the past week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Aircraft took off at \x91usual\x92 speed. Comparing other flights.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  FR24 data stopped being sent shortly after take off. Possibly indicating electrical fault.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Green and white flashing light reported by survivor. Possibly indicating electrical fault.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gear bogies were at unusual angle indicating Gear selected up and then interrupted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No smoke or flames to indicate bird strike. (Edit - still debate about this in the video above where the aircraft is behind a building)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No rudder input to indicate single engine failure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All speculation but hopefully a pretty balanced summary from the thread so far. It would be great if there was more focus now on what might have caused above rather than talking flaps, birds, 625\x92, etc.

     The only comments I would add are:-
     <br/>
     <br/>
     - It's a stretch to say the RAT is seen or heard "conclusively". Doubts have been expressed about the video quality and there are dissenting views regarding the audio. If a few more people were able to wade in on the audio point in particular, this could be very beneficial in moving the discussion forward because the presence or otherwise of the RAT is significant to several competing theories.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     - On the subject of audio, I am surprised there has not been more discussion regarding engine noise. In the primary eye witness video the (alleged) RAT can be heard distinctly, as can the sounds of distant impact. If the engines were working
     <br/>
     <br/>
     - Gear bogies: I'm not sure a consensus has yet been reached regarding the angle of the bogies. (I am not personally qualified to comment on this - I am purely saying I don't see a clear consensus just yet among those who are)
     <br/>
     <br/>
     - Mayday call: I don't recall seeing a confirmed source for the widely reported mayday. Others have brought this up in the thread but nobody appears to be able to confirm one way or the other. If accurate, its contents are informative. Am I right to presume that you have left it out of your summary due to a lack of confirmation?
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Thanks for the response. All great points you raise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I simply forgot to mention the Mayday. I think there are enough sources to suggest one was made but I\x92m slightly wary of its content.
  <br/>
  The recording and rebroadcast of RT exchanges is illegal in India as it is in the U.K. so we can\x92t be sure until its official release.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gear bogies - This was also mentioned by Juan Browne/Blancolirio as something to focus on, that\x92s probably what swayed me on this.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I was initially in the gear up/flaps up camp but I\x92ve been impressed by the testimonies of others here, particularly by the poster who\x92s heard hundreds of these overhead and the several videos shared for comparison.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As you say, hopefully we can put most of these topics to bed now (unless there is contradictory new evidence) and focus instead on where Occam\x92s razor points us.

     They had reached the maximum of 625 ft pressure altitude i.e 436 ft AGL. Must had been super quick in accomplishing the memory items. Just saying.ðŸ˜‡
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I think it was 650 feet above standard pressure of 1013.
  <br/>
  Correcting for QNH 1001? gives an altitude of 290 ft approx.
  <br/>
  Less 189 ft airfield elevation gives a height AGL of 100 feet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But that was based on last ADS-B return. From the video it looks like they reached closer to 200\x92 AGL using wingspan for scale.

    787-8 Dreamliners, the aircraft model involved in the crash last week that killed at least 270 people.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The cancellations on Tuesday affected services to cities including London, Paris, Vienna and Dubai. The airline cited a combination of aircraft unavailability, technical snags, airspace restrictions, and extended safety checks.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    At least three other Dreamliner flights have been grounded or delayed in the past 48 hours, as India&rsquo;s aviation regulator ordered rigorous pre-flight inspections across Air India&rsquo;s fleet of 33 Dreamliners

  Edited to add - this is NOT evidence of any particular issue, more what the impact has been of the safety checks that were called for 2/3 days ago and detailed on the first thread. The article is quite balanced but doesn&rsquo;t give much new info.
