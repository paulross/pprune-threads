     Yes. But I have not flown this scenario in the sim. Way too many protection to take off without proper configuration which leads me to believe loss of lift due to flap retraction. 1100 hr FO \x85\x85..

  I\x92ll reply to my own post in light of the RAT deployment.  If true then this opens up to a lot more.  And simply guessing with grainy video a fools game.   All I saw was gear down to high Into the climb.  This should not happen under any circumstance .  Dual engine failure would explain the loss of lift obviously.   Early flap retraction also.  One would hope it\x92s not a simple as that:  cheers

     Delta airlines had a Captain do this in 1986 on a 757 out of LAX. Came within a few hundred feet of ditching. Then flew all the way to CVG with the rat hanging out!
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Not 757 - it was a 767. Second time it happened in about 12 months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Determined to be an ergonomics problem with the switch layout in the flightdeck.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Early 767s (JT9D and CF6-80A) had a supervisory "EEC" (Electronic Engine Control - Boeing still uses "EEC" to identify what most people call the FADEC on modern engines). The procedure if an EEC 'failed' was to switch both EECs off (to prevent excessive throttle stagger - unlike FADEC, the engine could operate just fine with a supervisory EEC failed).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Problem was that the EEC ON/OFF switch was located on the aisle stand - right above the fuel cutoff switches. Turned out 'muscle memory' was when the pilot reached down there, it was usually to turn the fuel ON or OFF - which is what they did. Fortunately realizing what he'd done wrong, the pilot quickly restored the switches to RUN and both engines recovered. And yes, they continued on to their destination (RAT was still deployed since there is no way to retract it in-flight).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Previous event was with JT9D engines (United IIRC). In that case, only one engine recovered (second engine went into an unrecoverable stall), they simply came back around and did a single engine landing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Realizing the ergonomic issue, the EECs were relocated to the pilot's overhead (retrofit by AD).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To the best of my knowledge, there hasn't been a repeat of an inadvertent dual engine shutdown since the EEC switches were relocated. It's also very difficult to 'accidentally' move the switches as there is a locking detent - the switch must be pulled out slightly before it can be moved to CUTOFF.

  No, no, no and again no.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is a transport category aircraft. It will happily climb on one engine to a safe altitude where procedures are followed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There is zero evidence of any engine "failures" or shutdowns by the crew.

  However the gear is still down at around 500' agl.

     Just as an example of how many misconceptions, mistruths, half truths and complete BS there is in this, and any accident, thread consider this\x85
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I am very sure the only variant of the 757/767 that had a RAT was the 767-400, which was not in production in 1986. I flew the 767-200 and -300 with 3 different engine combinations (around 30-40 different airframes and 2 airlines) and none of them had a RAT.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Happy to be corrected if this model 757 (or 767 as someone in a later post says) had a RAT.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Sorry but you are wrong.  The RAT was basic on the 767 - every single 767 built has one.  The Gimli glider deployed the RAT (1982), and the Delta dual engine shutdown out of LAX deployed the RAT.

     <b>
      At this stage, at least two scenarios seem highly plausible:
     </b>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <b>
      1. Technical issue
     </b>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Airliners rely on
     <i>
      air/ground logic
     </i>
     , which is fundamental to how systems operate.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     There have been numerous crashes and serious incidents linked to this logic functioning incorrectly.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Some engineering tests require the air/ground switch to be set in a particular mode. If it's inadvertently left in engineering mode&mdash;or if the system misinterprets the mode&mdash;this can cause significant problems.
     <ul>
      <li>
       <b>
        On the ground
       </b>
       , if the aircraft is incorrectly in
       <i>
        air mode
       </i>
       , some systems may be unavailable&mdash;such as wheel brakes, reverse thrust, or ground spoilers.
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       <b>
        In the air
       </b>
       , if the aircraft is mistakenly in
       <i>
        ground mode
       </i>
       , flaps might auto-retract, and various layers of system protection may be disabled.
       <br/>
      </li>
     </ul>
     In the case of the ANA 787, it appears the engine shutdown occurred during the landing roll, possibly when the TCMA system activated.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <b>
      2. Pilot misselection of fuel control switches to cutoff
     </b>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     This is still a very real possibility. If it occurred, the pilot responsible may not have done it consciously&mdash;his mindset could have been in a different mode.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     There&rsquo;s precedent: an A320 pilot once inadvertently shut down both engines over Paris. Fortunately, the crew managed to restart them. Afterward, the pilot reportedly couldn&rsquo;t explain his actions.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     If something similar happened here, then when the pilots realized the engines had stopped producing thrust, pushing the levers forward would have had no effect. It&rsquo;s easy to overlook that the fuel switches are in the wrong position&mdash;they're far from the normal scan pattern. And with the ground rushing up, the view outside would&rsquo;ve been far more commanding.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Speaking personally, when I shut down engines at the end of a flight, I consciously force myself to operate each fuel switch
     <i>
      independently
     </i>
     and with full attention. I avoid building muscle memory that might lead to switching off both engines in a fast, well-practiced habit.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     If this is a technical issue, I assume we&rsquo;ll know soon enough.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  On item 1, the TCMA issue should have been fixed, it does fit the sort of issue that occurred here. TDRACER can talk to that, and has done in 2019 and again in post 792. As to flap auto retraction, the B787 like all Boeings has a gated flap lever, and the flaps are only able to move independent of the lever by flap load relief. That would not have caused a loss of thrust, and in this case it is evident that the event is a thrust loss not a CL loss.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On item 2, the video shows no asymmetry at any time, so there is only a symmetric failure of the engines possible. Back on a B747 classic, you could chop all 4 engines at the same time with one hand, on a B737, also, not so much on a B777 or B787. I would doubt that anyone used two hands to cut the fuel at screen height. Note, there was a B744 that lost one engine in cruise when a clip board fell off the coaming. Didn't happen twice, and it only happened to one engine.

     Yes indeed, the moment they pulled the gear lever, as we see the gear begin the retraction process, and then suddenly stop. Almost as if they suddenly lost power.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     We can see the landing gear retraction process begin. We see the bogies tilted in the second video. We can hear the RAT. We can see the RAT. We can see the flaps extended in the video and at the crash site. There isn't actually a single piece of evidence the flaps were raised, it's just a conclusion people jumped too before evidence began to emerge.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The crazy thing is, when the report comes out and there is no mention of flaps none of the people who have been pushing the flap theory will self reflect or learn anything. They'll think those of us who didn't buy into it were just lucky, rather than it being down to use of fairly simple critical thinking.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  &ZeroWidthSpace;&ZeroWidthSpace;&ZeroWidthSpace;&ZeroWidthSpace;&ZeroWidthSpace;
  <br/>
  Neila83 is correct, the gear tilt pre retraction is rear wheels low, and at the commencement of the selection of the retraction cycle (generally),
  <strike>
   the first thing that happens is the inboard MLG doors start to open below the wheel well and then the bogie is driven to front wheels low.
  </strike>
  (There is also an option that the inboard gear doors start to open early as a result of WOW sensing to improve the SSL climb limit). [my bad, for the B788 Capt Bloggs informs us the gear door sequence is after the tilt, not before, the B789 has the before tilt, the option for the door open at rotate is separate]
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <strike>
   The inboard doors do not appear to have opened in this case, yet, the gear is forward wheels down. This appears to be out of sequence. TD may have better knowledge on the options that exist with the B788, but this is not looking good at this time.
  </strike>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There is enough in the way of anomalies here to end up with regulatory action, and airlines themselves should/will be starting to pore over their systems and decide if they are comfortable with the airworthiness of the aircraft at this moment. A latent single point of failure is not a comfortable place to be. Inhibiting TCMA might be a good interim option, that system could have been negated by having the
  <b>
   ATR ARM switches....(Both)... ARM
  </b>
  deferred to the before takeoff checks. The EAFR recovery should result in action within the next 24-48 hours. Boeing needs to be getting their tiger teams warmed up, they can ill afford to have a latent system fault discovered that is not immediately responded to, and the general corporate response of
  <i>
   "blame the pilots"
  </i>
  is not likely to win any future orders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I think we are about to have some really busy days for the OEM.

  Speaking as a B787 Captain..... There is so much rubbish and stupid suggestion being written here.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This aircraft was airborne for a grand total of 22 seconds, half of which was climbing to no more than 150' aal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - No Flaps? Due to the setup of the ECL it is physically impossible to go down the runway without some sort of take-off flap set. The T/o config warning would have been singing it's head off. Despite assertions to the contrary I have seen no video clear enough to detect a lack of flaps.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - RAT out? Almost impossible, I have seen no quality footage that definitively witnesses the RAT being out. Those who think they car hear a RAT type noise might be listening to a motorcycle passing or similar. It takes a triple hydraulic failure or a double engine failure to trigger RAT deploment. They happily went through V1 without a hint of rejected take off so as they rotated the aircraft was serviceable. These are big engines, they take a long time to wind down when you shut them down. I have never tried it however engine failure detection takes 30s or for the aircraft to react and they were not even airborne that long.
  <br/>
  - Flaps up instead of gear? The B787 flaps are slow both in and out. Given that the 'Positive rate' call is not made the second the wheels leave the ground, a mis-selection of flaps up would not cause any loss of lift for at least 20 seconds, by which time they had already crashed. I believe the gear remained down not because of mis-selection but because of a major distraction on rotate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Discounting the impossible, two hypotheses remain:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  1. Invalid derate set through incorrect cross-checking. Trundling down the runway takes very little power to reach Vr. It is only when you rotate that you create more drag and discover that you do not have sufficient thrust vs. drag to sustain a climb. Or....
  <br/>
  2. Put 200' as the altitude target in the FCU. Immediate ALT capture and all the power comes off. PF is still hand flying trying to increase pitch but is already way behind the aircraft.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It could be after this that Boeing are forced to review the B787 practice of exploring the very edges of the performance envelope.

They happily went through V1 without a hint of rejected take off so as they rotated the aircraft was serviceable. These are big engines, they take a long time to wind down when you shut them down. I have never tried it however engine failure detection takes 30s or for the aircraft to react and they were not even airborne that long.
     <br/>
     - Flaps up instead of gear? The B787 flaps are slow both in and out. Given that the 'Positive rate' call is not made the second the wheels leave the ground, a mis-selection of flaps up would not cause any loss of lift for at least 20 seconds, by which time they had already crashed. I believe the gear remained down not because of mis-selection but because of a major distraction on rotate.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Discounting the impossible, two hypotheses remain:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     1. Invalid derate set through incorrect cross-checking. Trundling down the runway takes very little power to reach Vr. It is only when you rotate that you create more drag and discover that you do not have sufficient thrust vs. drag to sustain a climb. Or....
     <br/>
     2. Put 200' as the altitude target in the FCU. Immediate ALT capture and all the power comes off. PF is still hand flying trying to increase pitch but is already way behind the aircraft.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     It could be after this that Boeing are forced to review the B787 practice of exploring the very edges of the performance envelope.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I have to agree with everything here except your assertion about engine shutdown.
  <br/>
  Even though these are big engines with plenty of inertia, when you select engine shut off they spool down very quickly if on load. IE, The generators, two per engine and hydraulic pumps, etc, being driven by the (relatively) small mass of the N2 rotor will drag the speed down very quickly, the gennies will trip offine in seconds, the pumps will quickly reduce flow and pressure.
  <br/>
  As for what went wrong.
  <br/>
  If the engines have stopped working there has to be a common failure mode, fuel is one but as has been said, no other aircraft has had a problem, as far as we know. FOD? It would have to be something major to shut down two GeNX engines and there would be debris all over the runway, we would know by now.
  <br/>
  I have no idea if the RAT has deployed, I can't see it in the video and the noise could be something else.
  <br/>
  We shall see.
  <br/>
  There is compelling evidence that flaps are set correctly and not retracted inadvertently.
  <br/>
  I await further evidence.
  <br/>
  Edit to add. LAE 40 years, type rated on 737 to 787 with lots of others in between.

     Repeating myself (again), but ALL the TCMA logic is resident in the FADEC.

  After reading tdracers informative post this morning, I too was musing: Why is all this attention being given to TCMA.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Of course, when the probable cause is profoundly unclear, our continuing distrust of latent technical systems comes to the fore .... as sadly, the shadow of MCAS still looms large in our imaginations

     If TCMA cut fuel flow while still on the runway the aircraft would have been decelerating from the moment it lifted off, which is not what the ADS-B data indicates. The kinetic energy in the rotating parts of the engine wouldn't add much speed to the aircraft as the engines run down with no more energy being added via fuel.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I was not aware that we have granular ADS-B data from the a/c itself showing airspeed post rotation (rather than speed interpolated from GPS). Apologies if I have missed it. If it does show acceleration after takeoff I tend to agree with you.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In no particular order, here are some more thoughts on TCMA having caught up on the thread:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If you cut the fuel from two big engines at take-off power, there must be some delay before n2 decays below the threshold for generation (below idle n2), the generators disconnect and RAT deploys. GEnx have relatively long spool up/down times as the fan is so large (and would be exposed to 170+kts of ram air). Perhaps someone has a view on how long this would be, but I imagine it could easily be 10s or more between fuel cut off and RAT deployment. On AI171 the RAT appears to be already deployed at the beginning of the bystander video. That starts c. 13s before impact and around 17s after rotation. This does not prove anything except that the supposed shut down must have happened very close to rotation and
  <u>
   could
  </u>
  have happened just before rotation while the a/c was on the ground.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As a thought experiment, imagine if ANA985 in 2019 had decided to go around. The a/c rotates and is ~50 ft above the runway, suddenly both engines spooling down, very little runway left to land on and no reverse thrust available. I am struck by how similar this scenario is to AI171. This theory would require there to have been unexpected thrust lever movement in the moments before rotation - but plausibly one pilot moving to reject, followed by an overrule or change of heart - or even a simple human error such as the recent BA incident at LGW - could achieve this. This is perhaps more likely that any sensor fault that you would expect to only impact a single engine given the redundancy of systems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tdracer writes that a key requirement of TCMA is to identify an engine runaway in the event of an RTO, in order to allow the a/c to stop on the runway. This will have been tested extensively - it is a big leap to imagine a false activation could be triggered. It did happen on ANA985 but through a very unusual set of inputs including application of reverse (albeit this latter point may not be relevant if TCMA logic does not distinguish between the reverser being deployed or not).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Incidentally there is an assumption the TCMA software version in place on the ANA flight had already been patched and fixed on AI171. That probably is the case but I am not sure it is a known fact.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In summary I remain baffled by this tragic accident. I have not yet read anything that explicitly rules out TCMA activation and it remains a possibility due to the vanishingly small number of factors that could shut down two engines at apparently the exact same moment when they have fully redundant systems. Fuel contamination, for example, has typically impacted each engine a few minutes (at least) apart. I am also cautious (as others have pointed out) of a form of confirmation bias about Boeing software systems with four-letter acronyms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In my mind the cause could equally well be something completely different to anything suggested on this thread, that will only become clear with more evidence. All of the above also incorporates a number of theories, i.e. that there was an engine shutdown - that are not conclusively known.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thank you to the mods for an excellent job.

The PM has made the mistake without knowing. ie. he/she has selected the flaps all the way to UP believing that the gear was now retracting. Both pilots now think the gear is retracting, they have full thrust but are sinking into the ground. "Professional crews" like Air France for eg. have made way worse decisions. Slats are extended because they are the last to retract. I'm not convinced the RAT is deployed. If it has deployed it could've been a last ditch effort for the crew to bring the fuel control switches from RUN to CUTOFF &amp; back to RUN believing they've had a dual engine failure. This would account for the RAT if it did deploy. The APU inlet door could've been open as well because they were carrying out an APU to Pack takeoff.

  If you read the thread, you would know:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The RAT was almost certainly deployed. 4 different sources.
  <br/>
  The Flaps were not retracted. Visible at the accident site plus many other sources agreeing they were indeed down.
  <br/>
  APU will autostart when all engine power is lost. Potentially explaining why the inlet door was open or partially open at the accident site. Mentioned in several previous posts
  <br/>
  On a 787-8, the main bogies tilt as the 1st action of the gear retract sequence. As stated in previous posts. I don't think this happens unless gear is selected up. So the conclusion was, gear was selected up. One caveat, IIRC, there was some discussion around a failure could have caused the bogies to tilt without Gear up being selected but I don't recall the outcome.
  <br/>
  As for the Air France remark, un-necessary IMHO. Let's respect the crews please.

  Not a pilot, but an engineer with some experience in accident / incident investigation.
  <br/>
  One thing that strikes me in this and the previous closed threads is the lengthy back-and-forth discussion about potential technical faults that could lead to this accident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, there has been relatively little discussion about the #1 cause of all airplane accident - pilots' mistakes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Except for the initial conversation about mistakenly retracting flaps instead of landing gear, which eventually was dismissed in favor of engine failure as there has been an almost unanimous agreement that even if such mistake was made, it was recoverable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But what if the pilots made
  <u>
   more than one
  </u>
  consecutive mistakes?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mis-diagnosing the first abnormal behavior and making things worse by performing another action that instead of correcting the first mistake, turned the situation unrecoverable. The history of aircraft accidents is full of examples when a first, relatively benign issue was made much worse and eventually tragic by pilots' subsequent actions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Frankly, I think it is much more likely that the pilots made several consecutive mistakes than eventually led to the crash than a 1-in-a-billion unrecoverable mechanic failure. I'm looking forward to the CVR and FDR transcripts and I suspect that we will learn that after whatever happened first (pilot's mistake or minor technical failure), it was subsequent pilot's action that turned a manageable situation into a tragic accident.

  this vey situation happened to a good friend of mine, former Tornado pilot with 25 years on airliners, as a captain and PF on a B777. In his words he was initially totally confused why the aircraft stopped climbing. He engaged the autopilot and quickly realised the problem but they came very close to stalling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I would not like to place money on how quickly I would recognise the, highly unusual, situation of flaps being retracted with the gear remaining down and react appropriately.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Air India flight was circa 30 seconds from lift-off to crashing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I am sure an initial report will soon publish the basic facts.

  That was a partial answer, but still too many variables. Not nitpicking , but if you are trying to trace the source of a possible engine shutdown, you first need to list all the functions that have authority to do that, at source. Then generate a diagram showing all the steps along the path from those sources to the shutdown point. Truth is, we just don't have enough data to do that.

     Something that occurred to me after I went to bed last night: My assumption that the FDR readouts would rapidly reveal the cause may be flawed.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Let me explain.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The consensus is that both engines quit shortly after liftoff (that assumes that the RAT did in fact deploy). At least one of the data recorders has battery backup, so it should have kept functioning when all aircraft power was lost.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     However...
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Over the years, I've looked at lots and lots of digital flight data recorder outputs when investigating some sort of incident or other engine anomaly, So I have become rather familiar with some of the interesting characteristics of DFDR data.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     On the 767 and 747-400, when you shutdown an engine and the IDG goes offline, there is a momentary 'glitch' in the electrical power system as it reconfigures for the available power source - this is why you see the flight deck displays flicker and return, and the cabin lights momentarily flicker. As a result, most of the avionics boxes 'reset' - this is quick, but it's not instantaneous. This shows up in the FDR data - sometimes as 'no valid data' for a few seconds, or as garbage readings of zero or 'full scale'. Now, looking at the FDR data, it's easy to simply disregard the data, so normally no big deal.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Starting with the 777 (and on the 787 and 747-8), this electrical power glitch was 'fixed' - there is slight delay (~quarter of a second IIRC) before the fuel cutoff signal is sent to the engine - during which the electrical system reconfiguration takes place so no more 'glitch' during a normal engine shutdown...Except whatever happened to these engines wasn't 'normal'.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     If there is a fuel cut at high power, the engine spools down incredibly rapidly - a second or two from max power to sub-idle. Assuming the fuel cut wasn't commanded by the flight deck fuel switches, the electrical system won't know it's coming, so it can't reconfigure until after the engine generators drop offline - and you're going to get that power glitch. Nearly every avionics box on the aircraft will reset due to this electrical glitch, and the FDR isn't going to get useful data for a few seconds (and then, only from the stuff that's on the battery bus).
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Whatever happened, happened quickly - it's quite possible that whatever initiated the high-power fuel cut didn't get recorded.
    </div>

  Thanks as always TDR for your excellent professional input. It is therefore so much more perplexing that even you cant logic our way out of this impasse. That is, the assumption that the aircraft experienced a double engine failure (supported by a reasonably convincing argument that the RAT deployed), and yet no plausible reason (that we can see) for such an event. So some then collectively slip into the tired and lazy theories of intentional or unintentional crew actions that 1. beggar belief (intentional), 2. defy physics (flaps instead of gear despite clear evidence to the contrary) and call into question the professionalism of a very experienced Captain and crew as well as the aircraft manufacturer (because...well its Boeing so it must be software
  <img alt="" border="0" class="inlineimg" src="https://www.pprune.org/images/smilies2/icon_rolleyes.gif" title="Roll Eyes (Sarcastic)"/>
  ).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yet, the answer must be simpler and staring us in the face since logic and experience (everything you have offered TDR), tell us that modern airliner engines generally do not just suddenly quit flying at the same time. In this regard we can recall several instances of double engine failure associated with bird strikes generally involving large birds or large flocks or both. But it seems we have discounted this theory very early in discussion. Why? Because we cant see any birds, or flocks of birds or engine flames/surges or puffs of smokes from the engines which would support this. Really?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I have read all the 100's of posts (sadly) and while some very early posters tried to analyze the imagery, I suspect the very poor quality eventually discouraged most from seeing anything of interest. However, smattered throughout this discussion from the beginning to the end there have about four posts that describe seeing something where others have not. At least two of these were related to possible smoke but which were probably just the dust blown outwards by the wingtip vortices. Two others however have mentioned possible flames and puffs of smoke.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The video of course is very poor. There should be a special place in hell for people who subject us to looking at a video with continuous zooming in and out, inability to retain focus on the subject (it was just a CCTV monitor, not the actual aircraft they had to focus on) and constant camera shake. A video of a video, and then the resolution probably reduced for social media upload. This all results in a very unwatchable record of the aircrafts departure. The only immediate information gleaned seems to be some idea of how far down the runway the aircraft was at takeoff and the parabolic curve as it very clearly described the aircrafts flight path.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>

  <br/>
  But take a look at this frame. The right engine shows an artifact (pixelation if you like) that might represent a surge flame. I can almost see a puff of smoke just inboard of the aileron that may be associated with that too.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Am I just seeing distortion? Am I just seeing some smoke because that's where I would expect to see it?
  <br/>
  We are all very used to seeing everything in 4K today but back in the day when everything was low res we used to join the dots. If pixels existed then something was there. If they didn't, it wasn't.
  <br/>
  So if it's just pixels caused by distortion then they have coincidentally appeared in the tailpipe of an aircraft that crashed shortly after takeoff with a presumed double engine failure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But surely we would see the birds? Well, not in this video. You cant even see the registration number on the side of the aircraft and that is much bigger than a bird. Haze, distortion, focus and low res, and each individual bird wouldn't even make up a pixel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  So make of this what you will, but this problem may have started on the ground. Birds strikes are very common according to Some AI pilots who interviewed for this following article but I have no idea of the authenticity of this report:
  <br/>
  <br/>

  </a>
  <i>
   "The Air India pilots also added that Ahmedabad airport has long been known for bird activity near the runway, which could have contributed to the incident.
  </i>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <i>
   "This issue (of the excessive presence of birds) has been flagged multiple times," a third Air India pilot said, asking not to be named."
  </i>
  <br/>
  Of course, a single engine failure would not have brought this aircraft down, nor would it have deployed the RAT, but we can't see what happened on the left engine when the aircraft slipped behind the radio antenna building.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While these high bypass engines are designed and certified to keep running after experiencing certain types of bird strike, the effect on two engines concerns have been voiced about the contribution of certification to the mitigation of the risk hazardous bird strike in the two engine case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This from Sky Library:
  <br/>
  <a href="https://skybrary.aero/articles/aircraft-certification-bird-strike-risk#:~:text=Description,they%20cannot%20continue%20to%20fly" target="_blank">
   https://skybrary.aero/articles/aircr...nue%20to%20fly
  </a>
  .
  <br/>
  <br/>
  " A number of concerns have been quite widely voiced about the contribution of certification to the mitigation of the risk of hazardous bird strikes:
  <ul>
   <li>
    The case of bird ingestion into more than one engine at the same time is not addressed directly and it is clearly extremely difficult to meaningfully estimate the probability of such an occurrence. However, it has been observed that, since some of the current standards only require that a damaged engine can be safely shut down, this circumstance should be more fully considered when determining the acceptable outcome of ingestion into single engines, especially for the twin engine case.
   </li>
   <li>
    It has been noted that the potential effects of bird strikes on modern electronic flight control systems and flight deck instrument displays have not yet been fully assessed.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <br/>
  Maybe someone can do some video enhancing of this image as others have done with the audio enhancement to give strong probability of RAT deployment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If my suggestion can be corroborated at all, then the question of what happened next becomes somewhat easier to answer. Perhaps neither engine stopped running but they did so with limited thrust? If anything from the pilots mayday call can believed, it wasn't engines shut down..it was no thrust. So why did the RAT deploy? Cant answer that. And, I cant imagine it would be manually deployed if both engines were still running.
  <br/>
  However, TDR did say.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "On the 767 and 747-400, when you shutdown an engine and the IDG goes offline, there is a momentary 'glitch' in the electrical power system as it reconfigures for the available power source - this is why you see the flight deck displays flicker and return, and the cabin lights momentarily flicker."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Startle factor that electrically systems were about to fail? Manually deploy RAT?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Edit: I might add, they would have found remains on the runway if this did indeed happen. But we have heard anything from anybody?
