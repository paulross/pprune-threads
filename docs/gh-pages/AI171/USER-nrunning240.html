  Former Boeing Engineer, actually worked on this specific airplane prior to delivery.  To me this all comes down to if the RAT was actually out.  If not, lots of different factors people have already debated and likely some sort of pilot error that I'll let the pilots on this forum debate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If the RAT did come out, then we are looking at simultaneous dual engine failure basically at V2 which is so improbable (without bird strikes or purposeful actions) that it is basically impossible.  This is a 330 Min ETOPS aircraft.   I saw no rudder deflection or yaw indicating 1 engine failed first and then they shut down the second one on accident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Only two realistic options for me in that case are:
  <br/>
  1. cutoff of the engines by the pilots.  Either on purpose or accidental.
  <br/>
  2. maintenance actions by the Air India ground team that caused issues with the engine system or power generation system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  2 is the only one I haven't seen mentioned here and I say this as a no longer Boeing employee.  We STRUGGLED with AI during the EIS.  They were notorious for just parking airplanes and then using them as spare parts and then screaming for help when they had to go back and get the planes ready to fly again.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Still think 1 is much more likely but will just throw out that 2 since there were complaints from previous flights about IFE and AC which to me speaks to issues with the power generation possibly being neglected.

     Not yet seen a response to my question about which engine parameters are recommended by the FDR and what is the sample rate.
     <br/>
     Hopefully you might be able to answer this.
     <br/>
     Many thanks.

     I am a retired gas turbine engineer who worked on safety systems and assessments and assisted on a number of accident investigations (military fast jets) and would be interested to know this.

  I can't tell you off the top of my head.  I was an engineer at final assembly (mostly final body join and functional testing) and then did support for airlines post delivery (working with their engineering teams on maintenance and operation) so I wasn't intimately involved in anything data wise on the FDR.  My personal belief is that it should end up being glaringly obvious why the engines stopped working with the data they have, just to many coincidences happening at literally the exact same time for it to be some minuscule problem never envisioned before.  Pretty sure FDR and CVR will tell all.

     Apologies if already discussed but I'd be interested to know
     <span style="color:#333333">
      how common/unusual it is for a commercial aircraft to be "Stored for parts to be used on other 787's in the fleet" and then "Returned to Service"? These happened on 2019-01-23 and 2019-05-24 respectively according to this page.
     </span>
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  You would never know, since they are just parked for "maintenance" usually happens when the customer doesnt want to pay for new parts for things that break. In the cases of AOG situations many airlines probably rob a part or two from an aircraft currently in a longer check just to not have to wait for shipping or if there are shortages. AI was just one of the worst in taking perfectly good airplanes, robbing them blind for parts and then asking for help months later when they wanted to get them flying again. Maybe its better now but they were very much an outlier among other 787 operators.

     Oh, this is an interesting statement.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     So what kind of maintenance errors could AI possibly make, that would not cause a Christmas Tree of BIST errors during startup and preflight and crash the electrical system of the aircraft right after wheels off?
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I wasn't a power or engine guy so I don't know the systems well enough to make a guess.  The fact that previous flights had IFE and AC issues though does speak to general problems in the systems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  What I will say is that we are all so involved with our airlines and engineers definitely come home shaking their heads from airline visits sometimes.  I was at my 787 airlines main offices monthly, you can tell what the operation is like quickly.  AI was well known for being cheap and not wanting to do have stock of common replacement parts, and basically just used a few airplanes as their stockpiles.  No one came back impressed from their visit there.  Does that mean they are unsafe? No, not necessarily just that its not the most well run operation from my experience.

     This guy doesn\x92t sound like a pilot so I\x92d take what he has to say about technical issues with a bucket of salt- cabin crew often get incredibly dumbed down explanations for their level of knowledge
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Either way air India hasn\x92t had a terminal technical issue leading to a hull loss that I can seem to find, and it is over 60 years old. Shoddy legacy cabins has almost nothing to do with air safety and all those conflating the interiors of old air India planes with maintenance of critical items are being disingenuous at best
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  As someone who has worked with numerous airline engineering teams, companies and cultures where the small things are done well are also places where the big things are done well.  The problem is AI usually ONLY fixes critical items so they are "legal" but all it takes is once mistake or misstep and their can be a major problem.  I can assure you that any company that operates their interiors in the state that AI does also doesn't do all the things they should be doing proactively.

  The switches got moved to cutoff,  I dont see how anyone can take the audio from the report any other way.  There are way to many ECAM warnings in this case for the pilot to know that that's what happened if there was a short or similar software failure.  Add to the fact they got put back to run.  Why we will find out.
