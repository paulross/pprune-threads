     There has been discussion recently about a procedure that involves moving the fuel switches to CUTOFF and then back to RUN following a dual engine failure.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Attached is an image of a page from the Air India 787 Training Manual that discusses this procedure.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I am submitting this without comment or opinion.
     <br/>

  Nobody seems to have discussed this.  If I'm reading it right (and I'm not a pilot), it seems to be suggesting that in the event of a dual engine failure, a restart should be attempted while the engine still has high RPM?  It also seems to be indicating that fuel switch resetting should be attempted if the restart has failed to start the engine?

  I don't think that message has been confirmed?  Other reports have the pilot (identity not confirmed, I don't think?) just saying 'Mayday'.

  If there was a jumpseater, would that be officially recorded before they took off, or is it more of a casual decision?

     All the supposed quote does, is tell you that the person asking the question didn't perform the action, thus presumed the other had.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     There are many plausible explanations, not just the one or two you might choose to see in this scenario.

  As someone suggested, the person asking the question might have asked it to cover the fact that he had performed the action.

  The report says the pilots cleared a test for alcohol before flying.  I presume that's a breath test of some kind?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is a grisly question, but will there be physical evidence to test for drugs?  As in, medications that should have been disclosed to Air India, or medications that were disclosed but were not taken.

     No, that's an impossible scenario.
     <br>
      But you do have a point here. If the Flight Deck Door Surveillance system was inoperative, perhaps Air India has a procedure requiring someone to be in the flight deck to check the spy hole before opening the door? Just a thought.

  On the closed Part 1 of this discussion, one poster said that there was a jumpseater - a cabin crew member who was learning to fly.  This was never repeated or further discussed, and I couldn't work out if it was just conjecture.  But it's stuck in my mind.

  The report doesn't say WHEN the pilots spoke to each other.  The one doing the asking might have been speaking ten seconds after CUTOFF, simultaneously moving switches to RUN.  Or, he may have asked soon after observing the other's action, and there was a several seconds' delay before getting an answer.
