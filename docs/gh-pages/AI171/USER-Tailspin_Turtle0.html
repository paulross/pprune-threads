     The more i watch that video it really looks to me like it used the entire length of the runway before finally struggling into the air without enough airspeed to maintain flight, crashing nose-high just seconds later.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  My impression was very similar: they never had enough thrust for level flight with the gear down, used up the whole runway accelerating to something close to Vr, rotated and started to climb but very soon started slowing and had to reduce the angle of attack, starting the descent.

     You might want to rethink that.
     <br/>
     It's approximately 1km glide from where the aircraft was at roughly 200ft, not 2 km. 1km equals about 3000ft, so that is a glide ratio of 15. Taking into account a bit of excess speed to bleed off before reaching alpha max, this sounds very feasible to me.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I wondered about that as well. The 787 reportedly has an L/D of 21. Unfortunately, Google didn't provide me with a gear-down L/D (one data set stated landing L/D was 7 but presumably that includes landing flaps as well) but it is clear from some technical reports that it is a non-trivial reduction, maybe 44%. That suggests a gear-down L/D of 12, not taking into account headwind, change of elevation, off-optimum glide speed, etc. Obviously a higher beginning altitude and airspeed and shorter distance to the crash site that stated as well as the benefit of a flare would affect the outcome. However, the difference between an L/D of 16 and 12 given the stated beginning altitude (200 ft) and distance to the crash site (1 km = 3,280 ft) raises the possibility that the engines were still producing some thrust or were coming back on line.

     IMO
     <br/>
     In the CCTV video, the aircraft stops climbing at 00:28. 3 seconds after, it starts visibly descending. At peak altitude, using the 197ft wingspan as a measure, the altitude is around 200ft or below. The fireball is at 00:48, 17s after descent starts visibly.
     <br/>
     Per google maps and the impact location mapped at avherald, the impact point is ~3990ft from the airport boundary road and about 4200ft from the midpoint of the runway threshold and the airport boundary road.
     <br/>
     16:1 to 25:1 is what I could find for the 787 glide ratio range (unpowered) with main landing gear down and flaps 5. So the aircraft could cover 16 to 25 ft horizontally for every 1 ft of descent.
     <br/>
     With a starting altitude of 200ft, that would imply it could have covered 3200ft.to 5000ft during unpowered descent.
     <br/>
     The actual distance covered, around 4000ft, certainly seems to suggest that the descent was unpowered.

  Thanks for those numbers. Note, however, the max 787 L/D,
  <u>
   flaps and gear up
  </u>
  , is reportedly 21 (best in class), which casts shade on the credibility of those L/Ds, certainly 25 with the gear down. What is your source?
  <b>
   <i>
    <u>
     IF
    </u>
   </i>
  </b>
  the actual L/D with the gear down and flaps 5 is somewhat lower than 16 and given that starting height and distance traveled are correct\x97and considering that the aircraft might not have been at the speed for max L/D with the gear down and the possibility of a headwind\x97then there must have been some thrust during the descent (it did look to me to be somewhat flatter in that video taken from one side than I would have expected with the gear down, a relatively slow initial speed, and no thrust) or the engines were spooling back up at the end.

  Based on approximate distances and heights, the time line, the aircraft configuration, surface wind, the published L/D (gear up reduced to a guess for gear down and RAT out), and probable off-optimum speed for maximum L/D in that configuration, it's my opinion (aeronautical engineer, unused ATP rating, and glider pilot, national contests) that we can't rule out both engines being at idle or very low thrust at or shortly after rotation,

     Can someone help me with the calculations on how far from the point of our last ADS-B readout we can expect the stricken jet to fly/glide?
     <br/>
     I am assuming the take off mass around 190-200 tons with 50 tons of fuel. For the glide phase this is of no importance, however.
     <br/>
     Data on the Internet puts the glide ratio of a 789 around 18-21:1. Gear and flaps/slats out should have a significant negative effect. Does anyone have a good take how much? Minus 40%?
     <br/>
     From the available data we can infer the plane never was higher than 200\x92 AAL, maybe even 100\x92. If I understood the online sources correctly, the point of impact was only about 20\x92 lower than the average runway level.
     <br/>
     If I am not mistaken the distance from the last ADS-B point to the impact site is about 2 km as per Reuters and the Guardian. That would put it at 6,500\x92.
     <br/>
     I just can\x92t get these numbers over each other without the aircraft producing thrust. Please help me correcting the numbers.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  In prior posts, I used approximately the same numbers and came to a similar conclusion (we can't rule out the possibility that there was a least idle thrust available after the loss of thrust), using a guess of a 44% reduction for the configuration from a max L/D of 21. Starting with the height and distance being approximate however, we also don't know what the airspeed/angle of attack was at any point in the descent versus the speed for the maximum (and unknown) L/D for the gear and flaps extended and the RAT out, the amount of  headwind, the increase in L/D in ground effect (at a height less than the wingspan) over other than a smooth surface, thermal activity in a urban area, the distance gained in the flare at the end, etc.

     Yes, we can. The RAT was deployed, which only happens if both engines are fully shutdown, or the crew manually deployed it.

   </div>
  </div>
  Therefore the crew could have manually deployed it... (there's a button for that). If I saw the engines winding down and couldn't be sure that they would stop at idle, I'd be inclined to deploy the RAT instead of waiting for airplane to do it.
