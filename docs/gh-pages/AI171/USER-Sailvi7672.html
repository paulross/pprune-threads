     May I ask where this information of load shedding comes from please
     <br/>
     In my experience the APU supplies enough power to run all systems. Hydraulic pumps, fuel pumps etc

  </div>
  On the 767, 757 and A330 anytime you are in single generator operations the aircraft is load shedding. The 787 with a totally different electrical system might function differently.

     Sorry, you missed the point I was trying to make. \xa7 25.903(b) does say that the fuel system
     <b>
      must
     </b>
     <i>
      be able to operate
     </i>
     in an isolated, two-sided mode (for a twin engined jet), such that nothing on one side, such as bad fuel, will adversely affect the other engine. Of course, during Takeoff, both sides drawing fuel from a Centre Tank containing a lot of contaminants (e.g. Fuel Bug matter, water) is a scenario that could bring down the plane. We are all aware of that. But the point I was trying to make is that although \xa7 25.903(b) requires "at least one configuration" that separates both systems entirely (such as Left engine drawing from Left Main Tank, and Right from Right) which
     <b>
      <i>
       can
      </i>
     </b>
     be configured, the Rule doesn't appear to make that compulsory for Takeoff.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     A lot of other posters here have stated that according to FCOM instructions, the normal, accepted 787 Takeoff configuration is "Both sides draw from centre" if the Centre tanks have enough fuel in them. I think (maybe wrongly) that this (prior few posts) is the first time this exact point has been raised. I hope I'm correct there. If not, my humble apologies.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The great thing about this forum and sadly, this tragic accident, is that it's drawing a few previously little-known worms out of the woodwork.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Considering that 99.8% of the time modern transports aircraft are single point refueled I am not sure why all the discussion about burning fuel out of one tank. If bad fuel was pumped it\x92s in all the tanks. Even on the A330 while each engine is fed from its respective inner tank the center tank fuel is pushed to both inner tanks. Contamination of the center tank would put contaminated fuel in both inner tanks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  \x93Fuel from the center tank is transferred to the inner tanks to keep the inner tanks near full. The FCMC automatically controls the flow from the center to the inner tanks by operating the inner tank inlet valves. The center tank pumps run continuously when there is fuel in the center tank and provide fuel to the fueling manifold. When the inner tanks are full, the inner tank inlet valves are commanded closed until the inner tank fuel is burned down to approximately 4400 lbs below full. At that point, the inner tank inlet valves reopen to allow the inner tanks to fill, and repeat. \x93

  The data recorder has all the information most are questioning. They already know if the fuel control switches were selected to cutoff and they know if this happened before or after the loss of thrust. Perhaps the sequence of events will be more clear tomorrow. I can tell you that from aircraft rotation to loss of thrust was a very short time period. Perhaps 8 seconds. I simply won&rsquo;t believe in that time period the crew were taking any non deliberate actions that would have shut the motors down.

  There is a lot of grasping at straws in this thread. It seems pretty simple to me and only one explanation that fits the evidence. About three seconds after takeoff the Captain noted the FO turn of the fuel cutoff switches. He immediately questioned that for obvious reasons and the FO replied he did not again for reasons that seem obvious to me. He did not want it on the tape and he wanted to delay the Captain in trying to switch them back on. Had the fuel cutoff switches been restored immediately before the engines unspooled the accident would have been avoided. In addition the timing of the cutoff switches movement is exactly what you would expect if the copilot was using one hand trying to be discreet in his actions.

     So, under this scenario an 8,000+ hour PIC on type watches the FO select the Fuel Cut-off switches to Cut-off a couple of hundred feet off the ground, and rather than immediately resetting the switches to Run, he has a short Q&amp;A with the FO, and waits a full 10 seconds before taking any remedial action.

  I would suspect that if intentional the pilot who shut the engines down would guard the switches until he was sure the desired result was obtained. There would also be an extreme startle factor in this case. If I saw the PM hands in that area I also would not have immediately questioned that until I observed the engines spooling down.

     Where on Earth do you guys get the understanding the FO moved the switches? The FO is PF. His hands are on the yoke. Likely both of them.

       As per the EAFR data both engines N2 values passed below minimum idle speed, and the

     <br/>
     <br/>
     It suggests to me that the RAT deployment was initiated while the engines were still above idle and generating electrical power. Obviously one of the pilots could have done it via depressing the switch, as it's a "dual engine failure/stall" memory item (see
     <a href="https://www.pprune.org/accidents-close-calls/666581-air-india-ahmedabad-accident-12th-june-2025-part-2-a-70.html#post11918946" target="_blank">

     Is there a way for the RAT to deploy while the engines are still above idle?
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Loss of hydraulics or electrics will auto deploy the rat. The timing to me however seems to match up with when the engines were selected off.

     10 seconds to respond is a long long time if you&rsquo;ve just made a silly mistake, you&rsquo;d have those switches back on in a second. The startle factor isn&rsquo;t really a factor here, because you

     What is also unusual to me is the 4 second gap between moving Eng 1 fuel switch from cutoff to run, and moving Eng 2 fuel switch from cutoff to run.
