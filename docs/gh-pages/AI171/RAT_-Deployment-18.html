     This is my latest attempt to square the circle using all the data points and minimal assumptions. The main shortcoming of the analysis is not knowing the maximum L/D and the speed for maximum LD with the gear down, flaps 5, and the RAT extended. However, if I use a reasonable number in my opinion for the L/D in that configuration and assume that the airplane is being flown at the speed for it, it will not get to the crash site. The distance from the runway of the crash site is from a previous graphic (1.55 km); the rotation point from fdr, permalink 314; 200 feet max height above the runway being generally accepted; crash site 50 feet below the runway elevation cited previously. An average speed of 180 knots is consistent with the dimensions given and 30 seconds flight time. A flare at 50 feet will briefly increase the L/D to 20, maybe even 30 (500 feet more than shown) but still not enough to make up the shortfall, In fact, with a head wind the L/D will be lower than assumed as well as if the speed being flown is higher or lower than required for maximum L/D in that configuration. In other words, there must have been some thrust available.
     <img alt="" class="post_inline_image" src="https://cimg2.ibsrv.net/gimg/pprune.org-vbulletin/2000x1124/air_india_flight_profile_fa1d78e4f076a231f172af8888045ba46ee0fdd1.jpeg"/>

  There is easily-correctable available data with the aircraft's altitude at pretty much the end of the runway and it is not at 200 feet (it's around 100\xb112.5 feet).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As the aircraft visibly continues to climb past that height (and for a longer period than ADS-B data covers, if the camera's perspective casts doubt on that), it seems rather clear to me that it reached its peak height past the end of the runway.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In light of this I find the fact that people keep calculating a glide
  <i>
   from the runway
  </i>
  to the crash site to be a bit strange. Wouldn't the first step of any math be to try to determine
  <i>
   where
  </i>
  it started descending?

  - fuel cut offs were found in the RUN position

  - on take off roll both engines lost power as the fuel cut offs went from RUN to cutoff

  <br/>

  This should also dispel a lot of the comments about AAIB-India, Indian culture in general and general competence. For a preliminary report this is far more thorough and extensive than what would normally be expected and they\x92ve kept Boeing, GE, FAA and investigators from US, UK, Canada and Portugal in the loop from the start
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They have also clarified why it took so long to do the EAFR download- because of the extensive damage they had to source specialist equipment from the NTSB that only arrived on the 23rd of June (they downloaded on the 24th) so all that talk of a \x91coverup\x92 is pretty embarrassing now
  <br/>
  <br/>
  of course the big question is why/how those switches were commanded into cutoff in the first place  the exact sequence at Vr is the most critical, there hasn\x92t been much scrutiny at all that I can see in the Indian/international media of the personal
  <br/>
  background of the flight deck crew which has happened in other suspected pilot initiated disasters in the past, I guess this is an avenue investigators will have been doing themselves

    The aircraft achieved the maximum recorded airspeed of 180 Knots IAS at about 08:08:42
    <br/>
    UTC and immediately thereafter, the Engine 1 and Engine 2 fuel cutoff switches transitioned
    <br/>
    from RUN to CUTOFF position one after another with a time gap of 01 sec. The Engine N1
    <br/>
    and N2 began to decrease from their take-off values as the fuel supply to the engines was cut
    <br/>
    off.
    <br/>
    In the cockpit voice recording, one of the pilots is heard asking the other why did he cutoff.
    <br/>
    The other pilot responded that he did not do so.
    <br/>
    The CCTV footage obtained from the airport showed Ram Air Turbine (RAT) getting deployed
    <br/>
    during the initial climb immediately after lift-off (fig. 15). No significant bird activity is observed
    <br/>
    in the vicinity of the flight path. The aircraft started to lose altitude before crossing the airport
    <br/>
    perimeter wall.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As per the EAFR, the Engine 1 fuel cutoff switch transitioned from CUTOFF to RUN at about
    <br/>
    08:08:52 UTC. The APU Inlet Door began opening at about 08:08:54 UTC, consistent with
    <br/>
    the APU Auto Start logic. Thereafter at 08:08:56 UTC the Engine 2 fuel cutoff switch also
    <br/>
    transitions from CUTOFF to RUN. When fuel control switches are moved from CUTOFF to
    <br/>
    RUN while the aircraft is inflight, each engines full authority dual engine control (FADEC)
    <br/>
    automatically manages a relight and thrust recovery sequence of ignition and fuel introduction.
    <br/>
    The EGT was observed to be rising for both engines indicating relight. Engine 1&rsquo;s core
    <br/>
    deceleration stopped, reversed and started to progress to recovery. Engine 2 was able to
    <br/>
    relight but could not arrest core speed deceleration and re-introduced fuel repeatedly to
    <br/>
    increase core speed acceleration and recovery. The EAFR recording stopped at 08:09:11
    <br/>
    UTC
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As per the EAFR data both engines N2 values passed below minimum idle speed, and the

  That was with 10 seconds delay vs. 13 seconds for engine 2.

  Time was spent with the verbal exchange, and then perhaps each pilot expected the other to put the switch back?
  <br/>

  Anyway, the preliminary report also establishes that the aircraft had only 3-4 seconds of powered flight. (Would the gear lever be operated that early?) Everyone who saw that from the CCTV video, pat yourselves on the back.

  Mayday call, dual engine failure, RAT deployment all confirmed.
  <br/>
  TCMA was a red herring, the aircraft was firmly in air mode as the accident unfolded, and the thrust levers were at takeoff thrust the whole time.

      I have read most of the thread (old and new). As a lawyer working in forensic investigations, I am constantly involved in problem-solving. My field of work also includes complex investigations related to insolvencies, which almost always require an analysis of the causes behind a specific, established outcome. In doing so, I naturally also have to deal with probabilities. However, it often turns out that the most likely or plausible explanation does not reflect what actually happened.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Many of the considerations I\x92ve read fail because the simultaneous failure of both engines is extremely unlikely, leading to a constant search for higher-order causes. It was suggested that an incorrect altitude setting led to an early thrust reduction. However, this would not explain the deployment of the RAT (Ram Air Turbine), especially since the thrust could have been readjusted. FADEC and TCAM are highly redundant systems, and TCAM failure is unlikely due to WOW (Weight on Wheels) logic, making a simultaneous engine failure after VR equally improbable.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      With that said, and with regard to my question concerning the AD that relates to the fuel control switches (FCS), my thought\x97and it was nothing more than that\x97was that their activation becomes more probable if it can occur accidentally. That\x92s how I came across SAIB: NM-18-33.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Another user then brought up an iPhone. That notion would, of course, be dramatic\x97but how unlikely is it really that after approximately 10,000 actuations between December 2013 and June 2025, the two FCS no longer lock perfectly? Considering all of this, I find it quite conceivable that the A/T slightly reduced thrust in the first seconds after VR (e.g., if an incorrect target altitude had been entered) and that an object lying between the thrust levers and the FCS could have pushed the FCS into the \x93Off\x94 position. Due to the buttons on top of the switches, which provide some resistance, it\x92s even possible that the object both pulled and pushed them.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      But all of this is speculation. The investigation report will bring clarity.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Even if my theory is not confirmed, I still believe that the positioning and mechanism of the FCS are suboptimal. Switches of such critical importance should be better protected, and movements in the area in front of the switches (like reducing thrust) should not follow the same direction as shutting off the fuel supply. A different switching direction alone would provide more safety\x97especially considering that the FCS are protected laterally by metal plates.
     </div>
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  ﻿
  <br/>
  I wouldn't put too much significance in the "01 second" since this still is close enough for an unintentional cause.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No matter what: The design and position of the fuel cut off switches is potentially prone for mishaps.

    There is mention of fire damage or thermal damage to the centre pedestal, perhaps enough to identify the position of the switches but not to be able to determine their internal physical state relating to the detent mechanisms.
   </div>
  </div>
  The photo of the engine switches in the report shows the toggle of both switches pretty clearly, with the caps burned off (to be expected, has zero effect on function, nor detent locking). The fact that the toggles and lower mechanism of each switch appears in the photo is pretty conclusive (a) to the position of the switches at the time of crash, and (b) that the locking detent function of the switch was functional as intended. I've worked with these switches for decades, and they are very robust. Their lesser cousin design, which also has a center detent lock position (double throw) are less robust that these (single throw) switches, and they last well too. Though I have seen them worn, I have never seen the locking function worn to the point of not functioning as a lock. And these switches would be too new to have experienced wear/damage to that point.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For myself, I have total confidence that the switches functioned as intended. Obviously they commanded the fuel valve as intended, and can be seen intact (other than the plastic caps), and in the run position, so it is safe to conclude that a mechanical/electrical fault of both independent switches at the same moment is unlikely in the extreme. The FDR data states that they were moved to "off" position, which caused the engine shutdown, then returned to "run", so they obviously were mechanically and electrically functional.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The automatic deployment of the RAT is an indicator of the airplane systems sensing an engine shutdown, as is the APU autostart. Pax 11A mentioned the green cabin lights, which, if I understand correctly is an indication of a complete electrical generation failure.The time of all these events can be plotted from recorded data, which I expect we'll see in a full report later. In the mean time, it all makes unfortunate sense.

     Such a fault in a multi pole switch would be odd. And in two switches at roughly the same time?
     <br/>
     Typically you'd have a fault in one set of poles, giving you conflicting data.
     <br/>
     Such as the EAFR registers a fuel switch in cutoff, but the fuel did not actually cut off.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Don't forget that the RAT deployed instantly, shortly after liftoff, agreeing that both switches were in CUTOFF.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Yes - conflicting data issuing a warning when the system being controlled has no fault. That's a problem at considerable expense for a rare occurrence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Literally covering all the bases with a video would not only show what the switch status was but also how it got there, if it has an immediate effect, which a second line would not do.

     From the report, there is no indicated time stamp identifying the point when one pilot asked the other "why did you cut off"
     <br/>
     This could explain the the assumption that it took ten seconds to reverse the switch positions.
     <br/>
     Cut off could have been noticed at any point later than 08:08:42 but before 08:08:52.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  From my reading of the AAIB report, the delay in noticing the cut off switch position could not have been any later than 08:08:47 because the reference to the verbal exchange was written before the reference to the RAT deployment and I assume the written narrative follows the chronological sequence of events.  The delay in resetting those fuel switches might therefore have been no more than 5 seconds.  It is a pity that the pilot making the challenge didn't simply reset the switches to run instead of challenging the other pilot.  I frequently tell people who blow their horns at pedestrians or other motorists that blowing the horn isn't going to help them avoid an accident and that what they really need to do in the limited time available to them is concentrate on applying the brakes and turning the steering wheel.

  It suggests to me that the RAT deployment was initiated while the engines were still above idle and generating electrical power. Obviously one of the pilots could have done it via depressing the switch, as it's a "dual engine failure/stall" memory item (see

  Is there a way for the RAT to deploy while the engines are still above idle?

     The accident aircraft was written up for a status message of &rdquo;STAB POS XDCR&rdquo; on the previous flight, which is a message relating to implausible data from the stab trim switches. It was released from maintenance (according to the preliminary report) at 06:40UTC ahead of an 07:40UTC departure (the crash flight) with &rdquo;no fault found&rdquo;.
     <br>
      <br>
       On the 787-8, as all modern planes, switches are not cabled as dry closing contacts all the way from the switch poles to the affected end devices (FADECs in the case of fuel cutoff switches), but rather connect locally to an analogue/digital converter to encode the switch position data onto the digital comms bus ARINC629 which allows all aircraft systems to talk to one another.
       <br>
        <br>
         Are the fuel cutoff switches, which are positioned adjacent to the stab trim switches, connected to the same ADC module which produced the error message on the previous flight, which maintenance was unable to resolve before the accident flight took off? I do not know, but it must be worthy of being looked into.
        </br>
       </br>
      </br>
     </br>
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I believe the fuel cutoff switches are one of the exceptions to this. They are direct wired. Stab trim may well be too.
  <br>
   <br>
    I think they're called remote data concentrators - in many cases it is a conversion from a direct digital input to a bus signal; electronics would not call it an 'analog' input unless it was actually measuring a quantitative value.

        It suggests to me that the RAT deployment was initiated while the engines were still above idle and generating electrical power. Obviously one of the pilots could have done it via depressing the switch, as it's a "dual engine failure/stall" memory item (see

     I think I have seen a previous reference that the generators are disconnected when you select the switches to cutoff (or very shortly afterwards), not when the engine actually drops below idle. That could account for a few seconds of spool down time.

        What is unusual to me is the 4 second gap between moving Eng 1 fuel switch from cutoff to run, and moving Eng 2 fuel switch from cutoff to run.
        <br/>
        One would imagine that in this situation, speed of response would have been critical.

     That is a very good question IMHO.

     the RAT can be deployed manually, and I believe a pilot did that here before power was lost.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I don't think this answers my question? Evidently there is an interruption in power, the (quite stable, at that point) ADS-B stream cuts out and doesn't return for the final twenty seconds of flight. And there are other indications that non-essential loads were shed, like the survivor remembering what must have been emergency exit lighting in the cabin. Though I would have liked explicit confirmation of AC power loss happening or not in the report.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The timing of data loss seemingly lining up with the first cutoff switch being flipped back to RUN seems a little too coincidental to me, but again hopefully someone with relevant knowledge has a mundane explanation for this.

     10 seconds to respond is a long long time if you\x92ve just made a silly mistake, you\x92d have those switches back on in a second. The startle factor isn\x92t really a factor here, because you
     <b>
      know
     </b>
     what just happened.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Regardless of what actually happened in that cockpit, reasoning like this seems completely backwards to me. Since when do humans reliably, instantly recognise that they've just made a mistake? If they were
  <i>
   that
  </i>
  attuned to their actions they're almost certainly attuned enough to
  <i>
   not
  </i>
  make the mistake in the first place, especially if we're talking about an action slip. I've e.g. absentmindedly added salt to my tea instead of sugar and I certainly didn't immediately realise that I'd done that - in fact it took a good few seconds even after sipping and spitting it out for my brain to catch up to what must have happened. Even if an observer had pointed out to me before drinking it that my tea had salt in it, I would just have been confused because
  <i>
   obviously
  </i>
  I wouldn't do something that silly (spoiler alert: I did).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On top of that I feel like people are overestimating how long ten seconds actually is, especially considering some of those seconds are reported to have been taken up by confused dialogue (that isn't even reported in its entirety). I thought it was common wisdom that accidents are never down to one thing; it would be light-years from being the first time that suboptimal crew response turned a maybe-recoverable error into a definite disaster without an ounce of malice in the mix.

  Loss of hydraulics or electrics will auto deploy the rat. The timing to me however seems to match up with when the engines were selected off.
