      I have read most of the thread (old and new). As a lawyer working in forensic investigations, I am constantly involved in problem-solving. My field of work also includes complex investigations related to insolvencies, which almost always require an analysis of the causes behind a specific, established outcome. In doing so, I naturally also have to deal with probabilities. However, it often turns out that the most likely or plausible explanation does not reflect what actually happened.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Many of the considerations I\x92ve read fail because the simultaneous failure of both engines is extremely unlikely, leading to a constant search for higher-order causes. It was suggested that an incorrect altitude setting led to an early thrust reduction. However, this would not explain the deployment of the RAT (Ram Air Turbine), especially since the thrust could have been readjusted. FADEC and TCAM are highly redundant systems, and TCAM failure is unlikely due to WOW (Weight on Wheels) logic, making a simultaneous engine failure after VR equally improbable.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      With that said, and with regard to my question concerning the AD that relates to the fuel control switches (FCS), my thought\x97and it was nothing more than that\x97was that their activation becomes more probable if it can occur accidentally. That\x92s how I came across SAIB: NM-18-33.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Another user then brought up an iPhone. That notion would, of course, be dramatic\x97but how unlikely is it really that after approximately 10,000 actuations between December 2013 and June 2025, the two FCS no longer lock perfectly? Considering all of this, I find it quite conceivable that the A/T slightly reduced thrust in the first seconds after VR (e.g., if an incorrect target altitude had been entered) and that an object lying between the thrust levers and the FCS could have pushed the FCS into the \x93Off\x94 position. Due to the buttons on top of the switches, which provide some resistance, it\x92s even possible that the object both pulled and pushed them.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      But all of this is speculation. The investigation report will bring clarity.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Even if my theory is not confirmed, I still believe that the positioning and mechanism of the FCS are suboptimal. Switches of such critical importance should be better protected, and movements in the area in front of the switches (like reducing thrust) should not follow the same direction as shutting off the fuel supply. A different switching direction alone would provide more safety\x97especially considering that the FCS are protected laterally by metal plates.

  <br/>
  I wouldn't put too much significance in the "01 second" since this still is close enough for an unintentional cause.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No matter what: The design and position of the fuel cut off switches is potentially prone for mishaps.

  Folks, it appears that the message isn't getting through.

  <br/>
  There were two professional pilots on that flight deck.

  It is not acceptable to effectively accuse
  <u>
   <b>
    both

  of a criminal act, because there is no evidence to identify which hand -
  <u>
   <b>

  Unless and until any such evidence is published by the relevant authorities, kindly desist from doing so out of respect for your professional colleagues.

  There are two options. The fuel cut off was accidental or it was deliberate. The question from one of the pilots is why did you do that? The other pilot denied it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fuel was cut off but restored too late.

  For those sky gods who confidently state they would reset the cutoff switches immediately I would say that 10 seconds is not a particularly unusual time for startle effect to impair cognition, especially for something as monumental and unexpected as a dual engine failure at rotation. One reference amongst many:
  <a href="https://www.icao.int/Meetings/LOCI/Presentations/Managing%20Startle%20Individual%20Crew%20and%20Organizational%20Strategies.pdf" target="_blank">
   https://www.icao.int/Meetings/LOCI/P...Strategies.pdf
  </a>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And for those who scoff at the possibility of the PM inadvertently operating the cutoff switches (which is done as frequently as operating the gear lever), I\x92d remind you that more than one Airbus has landed with its parking brake on after the PM inadvertently set it rather than arming the spoilers.

  From the report, there is no indicated time stamp identifying the point when one pilot asked the other "why did you cut off"
  <br/>
  This could explain the the assumption that it took ten seconds to reverse the switch positions.
  <br/>
  Cut off could have been noticed at any point later than 08:08:42 but before 08:08:52.

     Background
     <br>
      The Boeing Company (Boeing) received reports from operators of Model 737 airplanes that the fuel control switches were installed with the locking feature disengaged. The fuel control switches (or engine start switches) are installed on the control stand in the flight deck and used by the pilot to supply or cutoff fuel to the engines. The fuel control switch has a locking feature to prevent inadvertent operation that could result in unintended switch movement between the fuel supply and fuel cutoff positions.
      <b>
       In order to move the switch from one position to the other under the condition where the locking feature is engaged, it is necessary for the pilot to lift the switch up while transitioning the switch position. If the locking feature is disengaged, the switch can be moved between the two positions without lifting the switch during transition, and the switch would be exposed to the potential of inadvertent operation.
      </b>
      Inadvertent operation of the switch could result in an unintended consequence, such as an in-flight engine shutdown.

        ...The table below identifies the affected airplane models and related part numbers (P/Ns) of the fuel control switch, which is manufactured by Honeywell.

  That isn't the human factors question.  All it does is tell us that one of the flight deck crew was unaware of the issue as it was initiated. It doesn't tell us which, and it doesn't tell us why.

     Agreed, it's most unfortunate that that the preliminary report hasn\x92t closed off speculation, it's simply created opportunity for more.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     It confirms that both fuel cutoff switches were moved to OFF at Vr, within a one second interval which is as extreme and inexplicable as it gets. Then it gives us a CVR quote that\x92s so neutered, "Why did you cut off?\x94 / \x93I didn\x92t\x94, that it raises more questions than it answers. If the goal was to reassure or clarify, it\x92s had the opposite effect.

  Action slip

  Intentional.

     The report mentions that the immediate prior flight crew had written up a "STAB POS XDCR" status message, and that troubleshooting was carried out.
     <br/>
     Is it possible that the troubleshooting/diagnostics left the stab cutout switches on the pedestal in the cutoff position, which went unnoticed until liftoff (i.e. upon noticing that the trim wasn't operable), resulting in a reach towards those switches, which are situated right next to the engine cutoff switches?
    </div>
   </div>

  Like this? Actually, the middle switches should look like the port side ones IMHO. Properly guarded.

  Anyone who has flown the 777/787 (imagine the 737 is similar) probably recognises that the movement of those switches has a very easily identifiable audio signature.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Given the sensitivity of the CVRs, I would imagine it would be a very simple task in the full report to compare that to the unlikely scenario of the switches being in some halfway house and slipping to cut-off to to rotation or g-forces etc

     Well, it\x92s narrowed it down to 3 possibilities:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Action slip

     SAIB NM-18-33

     Intentional.

  I would add a fourth, however unlikely it might be: some kind of electrical short which caused the "cutoff" signals to be sent without the physical switch moving.

     And for those who scoff at the possibility of the PM inadvertently operating the cutoff switches (which is done as frequently as operating the gear lever), I\x92d remind you that more than one Airbus has landed with its parking brake on after the PM inadvertently set it rather than arming the spoilers.

  Those switches are lift to move. They were lifted to shut off and thrown back to start in the report. No CVR or FDR trace is going to explain why two switches were throw by error or by intention. Only a video would. PnF would have had his eyes outside or on instruments for the calls. As mentioned, other manufacturers put such switches out of harms way for  general use. QRH is the only reason to go to them.

     A douple-pole switch.

  It looks to me like they already are. If you look at the photo of such a switch in isolation near the end of the last thread, you'll see that there are many wires shown - like in a ribbon cable - leaving the switch. But electrically, what you suggest doesn't really do it.
  <br>
   <br>
    It's possible that a contact could "open" due to oxidation, vibration etc without any real switch movement (but extremely unlikely in aviation-grade equipment - apart from liquid spillages that occurred some time previously...). However, if it was a double-throw switch - which it may be - you'll have the chance to see one side open and depending on whether it's make-before break or the opposite (break-before-make seems more likely, but as I found out, when it doesn't behave consistently, the consequences can be dire), the other set of contacts will close, either before or after the first side opens. That's MUCH more difficult to have happen due to contact faults. I'd say impossible, except never say never!
    <br>
     <br>
      Designing stuff like this is so difficult - do you eliminate one risky possibility only to create another?
      <br>
       <br/>
       For example, do you say, OK, to shutdown the engine, the Run contact
       <b>
        <i>
         must
        </i>
       </b>
       be Open and the Cutoff contact
       <b>
        <i>
         must
        </i>
       </b>
       be Closed before you can shut the engine down? Then, if someone tipped coffee into the switch a year ago, and the Cutoff contact is now insulated by a nice thick layer of dried, milky, sugary coffee and can't make contact, then the engine won't shut down. What do you do?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       That said, I think the positions of those two, adjacent, low down Cutoff switches are simply accidents waiting to happen. (As has been said many times. When is the manufacturer going to act?)

  Anyone willing to make an estimate of how long would be required to reach take-off thrust given the known movement of the cut-off switches? With engine 1 spooling up and engine 2 having relit but failing to accelerate, it sounds like they came oh so close to recovery.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I imagine that what happened with engine 2 ("able to relight but could not arrest core speed deceleration and re-introduced fuel repeatedly to increase core speed acceleration and recovery") will be a major part of the investigation.

  it would have to be small enough to fit between the idle throttle position and guards on each side of the switches and weigh enough to push the switches over the detent, unless the SAIB cones into play.
