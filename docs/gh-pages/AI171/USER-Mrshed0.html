  Sometimes I think asking the simple questions is the best approach.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Regardless of flap state, RAT state, etc...
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Is there any scenario at all that would give the apparent flight path *other than* a lack of thrust? Personally struggling to see one although as a lowly SLF I'm interested in whether this is overly simplistic - thrust but lack of lift would (presumably) result in the same outcome, but further out. Appreciating that the data we have so far on actual flight path is patchy past a certain point.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The very fact that this was so fast (and therefore relative lack of pilot correction possible or possible to take effect) means that the flight path itself should tell a story?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Then of course, if true, one can speculate to death about *why* a lack of thrust.

     I suggest to read this blog by Flightradar24. It does show the receiver(s) picked up signal after rotation of the aircraft.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  The image here of the comparison flight paths is interesting as (with the caveat of this data being low resolution etc) it would show two things:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  1) that the data stopped around about time of peak AGL - we knew this already.
  <br/>
  2) that the flight path was much shallower *before* whatever event caused the data to stop (note that this data should be accurate in comparison even if not in absolute).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The second point would presumably imply whatever the issue was, it wasn't solely something that happened instantaneously once the decline began, but rather at least two events (presumably not independent) - one that impaired flight, and one that stopped the data transmission (and also likely impaired flight further).

     Hello posters,
     <br>
      <br>
       We mods are working away on this thread. To be honest, I cannot recall a recent thread with more discussion - which is what we're we for! Good!
       <br>
        <br>
         That said, I, and several other mods, have asked that posters "familiarize themselves" with the contents of the thread. Maybe read all of it, maybe read back a few days before posting. Has what you're thining to post as "new" information, already been presented and discussed (and perhaps dispositioned)? We mods have read most of the posts, so we're trying to stay on top of it, to give readers less to no nonsense to have to read through. We have asked some respects for the crew, particularly in regard of postulated intentional acts - just don't.... unless firm, credible (future) evidence opens this theme. We mods are clearing out such posts with no mercy, but it's still work, and other decent thoughts may get lost in the dustbin as a result (we very, very rarely edit out only a part of a post).
         <br>
          <br>
           And yes, report posts which you really feel are not worthy here, we mods do consider every report. That said, how about
           <i>
            not making
           </i>
           report worthy posts! My [our] inboxes have been filled with report emails this time around.
           <br>
            <br/>
            We eagerly promote good compliant [to PPRuNe rules] discussion, keeping posts within the guidelines makes it more enjoyable for everyone, and less work for your mod team - we really are trying to keep this place the professional pilot discussion you're looking for!
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Thanks, Pilot DAR
            <br/>
            <br/>
            P.S. Please don't post AI generated crap, okay? (thanks for reminding me Tu.114)
           </br>
          </br>
         </br>
        </br>
       </br>
      </br>
     </br>
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Thank you for your efforts mods - don't envy your task on this thread (from a simple long time lurker first time poster in this thread SLF!).

     The phrase in the report is "switches transitioned from RUN to CUTOFF position".
     <br>
      Does the FDR actually have some input of the physical position of the switches or is it just measuring the output signal voltage
      <br>
       which might be changed by a momentary short from liquid or swarf.
       <br>
        Both signals go to cutoff within 1 second but then one recovers four seconds after the other.
        <br>
         Surely a pilot discovering a turned off switch would have both back on in less than four seconds.
        </br>

      </br>

    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  The fact that one of the pilots verbally asked why they were off, presumably from visually observing this (?), would seem to rule out a short?

     In the case of (2) or (3), would the expected response be "Why did you cutoff"?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I would have thought a pilot would notice the engines spooling down, and comment on that. To immediately jump to the cutoff switches as the cause rather implies something drew attention to the switches.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Then there is a 10+ second gap before the switches are set to run again. I can't think of any good reason why the PNF would have taken so long to correct an accidental or deliberate manipulation of the switches.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Exactly right.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  You need to take the audio together with the switch data, not in isolation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two combined would appear to rule out a lot of options that the data alone would leave possible.

  As a non pilot, I find this statement in the report interesting (in it's inclusion if nothing else), but I assume that this reference to the replacement module in 2023 (the module including the fuel cutoff switches?)  we view as pretty irrelevant to cause?

    The scrutiny of maintenance records
    <br/>
    revealed that the throttle control module was replaced on VT-ANB in 2019 and 2023.
    <br/>
    However, the reason for the replacement was not linked to the fuel control switch. There has
    <br/>
    been no defect reported pertaining to the fuel control switch since 2023 on VT-ANB.
