     Can we focus on theories explaining the facts? Specifically:
     <ul>
      <li>
       Aircraft used almost the whole runway (3500m)
      </li>
      <li>
       Flaps found on the ground in setting 5
      </li>
      <li>
       RAT deployed
      </li>
      <li>
       Mayday that they lost power
      </li>
     </ul>
     this rules out flap up instead of gear up , selecting wrong autopilot setting, gear up causing electrical faults (as problems started earlier - using up all runway). Something must have happened on the runway (after v1?) that led to loss of electrics (and dual engine failure, maybe later?)
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Define facts! Reported by an eyewitness, reported by Indian media? The ' mayday that they lost power.' is not a fact but invented by a journalist. The " aircraft used the whole runway" is not officially reported by the investigators but noted by an Indian newspaper. In the same article of today this newspaper wrote about the fake mayday call.

  Given the evidence now in the public domain of RAT auto-deployment and simultaneous roll back, with no bird strikes, the most plausible primary trigger is a simultaneous, fuel-related thrust failure on both GEnx-1B engines. Simultaneous FADEC failure seems less likely, at least without tampering.

  1. The reduction of thrust is not limited to a fuel failure
  <br/>
  <br/>
  2. Without any recordings, TOI is not a reliable source
  <br/>
  <br/>
  2a. The long runway roll in the tagline has not been proven, as seen many times in this thread
  <br/>
  <br/>
  3. The last words of a panicked captain may not be an accurate description of the situation
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Your theory may be true, but it is speculation built on assumptions

  It's nearly 1000 posts ago I doubted the mayday call was genuine, and that ToI report helps to reinforce my doubts, it looks like they read this thread and created their report from that, it is just more speculation, some already disproven, certainly no more facts.

     The Mayday specified loss of control and engine failure.

   </div>
  </div>
  This has been reported but not naming any verified or even specified source. I have also recently read in this thread at least 2 different versions, the most recent one before yours, upthread, being even more specific than the one that went around at first. Despite what is being quoted by yourself and others, with no verified source, the Indian Aviation minister reported at the most recent press conference that the mayday message was as follows :- "mayday, mayday". ATC replied asking for further info, but got no reply. Despite a lot of searching online, that is ALL that is currently verified, so far, re the mayday call.

  A little bit tangential here, thinking about this Mayday call (the exact contents of which haven't been verified, but have been variously reported as "no power", or "lost power" ) , if in front of you on the PFD, in large red letters, you have the words ENG FAIL, why would you say, "no power"? Seems a bit strange. Why not say "engine failure" or "no thrust"?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Could it be that "No power" may have meant the whole cockpit went dark? ie. A total electrical failure or huge short (survivor's bang) initiating RAT deployment and apu autostart. Doesn't explain loss of thrust explicitly but if there was a massive electrical issue, and critical data was lost (thinking air/ground switch position and other fundamentals), would dual engine shutdown be a possibility? Simultaneous FADEC failure? Exceptionally remote possibility perhaps, but by definition these accidents are exceptionally remote. If the RAT deployed we know there was definitely an electrical issue - how bad was it, though? Thinking about the possibility of an electrical failure causing an engine (and instrumentation) failure rather than the other way around. Over to the experts on this.

  Per the Mayday call, the only direct quote I can find relating to it is in a Guardian report on June 14, where
  <span style="color:#121212">
   Samir Kumar Sinha, a secretary for India\x92s aviation ministry, is quoted as saying that the call was "Mayday, mayday".
  </span>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <span style="color:#121212">
   That from a briefing by India\x92s aviation authorities on Saturday, which confirmed that Captain Sumeet Sabharwal, who was piloting the flight, sent the distress call, and that there was no response to ATC calls to the aircraft.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   If that quote is accurate, there was no reference to power loss or any other factors in the Mayday call that was received.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   (Edit to correct 'June 15 to June 14 when the briefing took place - apologies for the typo)

  Seen multiple versions of the content of the "Mayday" call now and all subtly different. Anyone seen any mention of whether it was in English or, under high pressure, the poor guy had fallen back to Hindi or whatever his native language was? Semantics important here (is "Power" electrical power, for example).

  I have read somewhere that the Captain was the pilot flying.
  <br>
   At the same time he was also the one calling mayday. Could this be an indication for the power loss and that only the captain side radios been powered by the emergency electricity system and that\x91s why he was doing the radio call instead of the pilot monitoring (FO)

     I have read somewhere that the Captain was the pilot flying.
     <br/>
     At the same time he was also the one calling mayday. Could this be an indication for the power loss and that only the captain side radios been powered by the emergency electricity system and that\x91s why he was doing the radio call instead of the pilot monitoring (FO)

  Not a pilot so nothing to add to what caused the crash but a firefighter. Since some here seem to believe that a mayday call would have been useless in the given situation: If you think you\xb4re going to crash, please do a mayday call if possible (not wanting to take part in the discussion whether or not such a call took place). It saves precious time to figure out what happened, where, how to get there and with which equipment. Not every engine can reach every destination. plus we need to know whether we need to put on breathing protec

Knowing that that loud sound in the distance is probably from an impact into some building gives us a head start. This probably wouldn\xb4t have helped or didn\xb4t help here but generally  there\xb4s nothing more frustrating for us than being unable to save lives because we\xb4re too late, knowing that not being on time was preventable.

  If there was water in the E&amp;E bay, the pitch angle change at rotation would cause said water to move (backwards, upwards, slop, splash) and that is exactly when then problems on this flight started, and apparently the point where the surviving passenger heard a bang (elect short?) and the cabin lights flickered (change of elec source).
  <br/>
  Captain's mayday says "no power", he means no electric power, engines have rolled back due some internal system failure for sure, because no external factors have caused them to fail. And all internal systems are.... Electric

     Where are the details of the mayday call? Maybe I have just missed it.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I only saw the words quoted in one post, and I'm not sure that post looked factual.

     Quite surprised there have been no recordings posted anywhere (even allowing for different lifestyles and hobbies)

     It looks to me like it lost all thrust at some point in the rotation.

  This seems the most likely. Loss of thrust in both engines.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mayday call included \x93no thrust, losing power\x94.

  Not a great day out for a professional pilot. RIP.

      True. But possibly the pilot realised the gravity of their situation and decided that one last message of "what's happening" may help any following investigation.
     </div>
    </div>
   </div>
   Assuming the reported Mayday message is correct then a final message indicating a hopeless situation has to be a possibility.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Possibly the Captain did correctly perceive the information on the status of the aircraft
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Possibly he did correctly comprehend the situation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Possibly he did project the situation into the future
