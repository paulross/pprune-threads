     Can anyone suggest a good reason why the captain should issue a Mayday call at that point? The crew should have been extremely busy with the situation. Aviate, Navigate, Communicate is a mantra we are all familiar with. So why communicate?

     Having discussed the accident with experienced pilot colleagues, we have all considered that the Egyptair 990 case offered similarities. Yet this is almost a taboo subject.
     <br/>

     And one's suspicions are raised by the fact that Air India/Tata are keeping ICAO out of the post-crash investigation.

     Incidentally, I sincerely hope that we are wrong about the possibility of a deliberate dual engine shutdown shortly after rotation.

  Being as this is a professional pilot's site, we will extend the benefit of the doubt to our pilot colleagues, and be respectful to them. As the facts of the event become publicly available from reputable sources, we will of course discuss them as factual entry points to a discussion, rather than speculation. Patience.....

  As per my training, don't let communicate interfere with aviate. If you can do both simultaneously, go ahead. For me, "communicate" could be taking your mind away from task to formulate and interact in discussion. So yes, we don't allow a complex discussion to preempt flying the plane. For me, pressing a mic switch and calling Mayday is more instinctive and muscle memory, than distracting. If a pilot got a Mayday out, good for them! I can't see it helping much for the doomed flight, other than being a valuable "very soon after the event" indicator that the pilots knew that something very bad was happening. I've known pilots to wrestle control for seconds/minutes in an effort to regain control, before issuing a Mayday. Okay, tasks in priority. But in this case, it appears that a pilot issued a Mayday even before control was actually lost - a valuable timestamp on the order of events for investigation.

  I got the idea that with no (or very little) thrust, and with the aircraft falling, the pilot (may have) realized that he was in
  <i>
   out of control flight
  </i>
  , and falling.
  <br/>
  In a pedantic sense: if you make control inputs, and the aircraft won't or can't respond to them, you are in
  <i>
   out of control flight
  </i>
  .
  <br/>
  The whole event happened pretty quickly. How far into "we are doomed" that his senses told him they were can have informed his decision to say something about it. (the human mind is an interesting thing).
  <br/>
  There's also the matter of temporal distortion which can happen during stress or high adrenalin events. (I experienced that during the course of an aircraft accident: not on topic for this thread).
  <br/>
  As to conformance with ICAO, not all investigations make good on that.

    On 21 March 2025 (the third anniversary of the accident), the CAAC did not release an annual investigation progress report or a final investigation report,
    <b>
     as required by the Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation and CAAC's own coded regulations

    .
    <br/>
    <br/>
    On 19 May 2025, in response to an open government information request, the CAAC said that it decided not to release the interim investigation report to the public because releasing the report might "endanger national security and societal stability".

  I've been in a similar situation once when the
  <a href="https://asn.flightsafety.org/wikibase/325796" target="_blank">
   Twin Otter I was flying was hit by a surface-to-air missile
  </a>
  . I put out an initial Mayday call as soon as I had the heading &amp; altitude under control (that took about 5 seconds) but before taking any other actions. I didn't have any intention of entering into a long conversation when I made the call, I just wanted dispatch to know that we had a serious problem - in case we didn't come out of it alive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fortunately, we did come out of it alive, and after completing all the appropriate checklists, picking a nearby airport to land at, and lighting up a cigarette, I called dispatch back and explained the situation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To me, it is understandable that the pilot made a Mayday call.

     The data recorder has all the information most are questioning. They already know if the fuel control switches were selected to cutoff and they know if this happened before or after the loss of thrust. Perhaps the sequence of events will be more clear tomorrow. I can tell you that from aircraft rotation to loss of thrust was a very short time period. Perhaps 8 seconds. I simply won&rsquo;t believe in that time period the crew were taking any non deliberate actions that would have shut the motors down.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Assuming the 2nd/3rd-hand 'leaked' info about fuel switches is even accurate the scenarios of what they know (investigators / leaker) would be:
  <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
   <li>
    They know exactly 1 fuel switch was cut off, perhaps implying single engine failure + wrong engine shutdown
   </li>
   <li>
    They know 1 or both switches were cycled off then on, implying a last-ditch attempt at some sort reset at any point up to say ~30s
   </li>
   <li>
    They know both fuel switches were cut off, and remained off, implying sabotage
   </li>
  </ol>
  Working logically through these:
  <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
   <li>
    If the cut off happened within 20s of leaving the ground perhaps it could explain why CCTV shows the initial climb then level for ~10s before descent. It could also explain the RAT and gear trucks perhaps if gear up was delayed? However, in this scenario they must know that the engine failed, that information would be clearly recorded and surely the leak would lead with that info? Also 'switches' is plural implying both, the radio call didn't mention single engine failure and like you say its quite hasty, even within 20s.
   </li>
   <li>
    Again assuming switches plural, this implies either of the prevailing theories of dual engine failure leading to loss of AC or loss of AC leading to reduced thrust or engine failure. However, it also seems strange to lead with that info rather than the state of the engines or electrical systems in any flight data, unless someone can explain how the data would be impacted?
   </li>
   <li>
    If this was the case then it would imply that there is no voice or engine data to explain the cut off, nothing was said and the engines were normal up until that point
   </li>
  </ol>

  With the recent (albeit unofficial) indications that both engine fuel control switches were found in the CUTOFF position, I wonder if it's time to reassess the tone and meaning of Captain Sabharwal's final transmission (perhaps translated from Hindi) &ldquo;Thrust not achieved&hellip; falling&hellip; Mayday!

  - fuel cut offs were found in the RUN position
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - on take off roll both engines lost power as the fuel cut offs went from RUN to cutoff
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - CVR recorded one pilot asking why they had gone to CUTOFF
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - within 10 seconds the fuel cutoff was moved back to RUN
  <br/>
  <br/>
  -RAT was deployed, APU had begun auto start
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - 32 seconds after Vr the MAYDAY was called
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This should also dispel a lot of the comments about AAIB-India, Indian culture in general and general competence. For a preliminary report this is far more thorough and extensive than what would normally be expected and they\x92ve kept Boeing, GE, FAA and investigators from US, UK, Canada and Portugal in the loop from the start
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They have also clarified why it took so long to do the EAFR download- because of the extensive damage they had to source specialist equipment from the NTSB that only arrived on the 23rd of June (they downloaded on the 24th) so all that talk of a \x91coverup\x92 is pretty embarrassing now
  <br/>
  <br/>
  of course the big question is why/how those switches were commanded into cutoff in the first place  the exact sequence at Vr is the most critical, there hasn\x92t been much scrutiny at all that I can see in the Indian/international media of the personal
  <br/>
  background of the flight deck crew which has happened in other suspected pilot initiated disasters in the past, I guess this is an avenue investigators will have been doing themselves

    The aircraft achieved the maximum recorded airspeed of 180 Knots IAS at about 08:08:42
    <br/>
    UTC and immediately thereafter, the Engine 1 and Engine 2 fuel cutoff switches transitioned
    <br/>
    from RUN to CUTOFF position one after another with a time gap of 01 sec. The Engine N1
    <br/>
    and N2 began to decrease from their take-off values as the fuel supply to the engines was cut
    <br/>
    off.
    <br/>
    In the cockpit voice recording, one of the pilots is heard asking the other why did he cutoff.
    <br/>
    The other pilot responded that he did not do so.
    <br/>
    The CCTV footage obtained from the airport showed Ram Air Turbine (RAT) getting deployed
    <br/>
    during the initial climb immediately after lift-off (fig. 15). No significant bird activity is observed
    <br/>
    in the vicinity of the flight path. The aircraft started to lose altitude before crossing the airport
    <br/>
    perimeter wall.
    <br/>

  It seems to me that there must have been further dialogue after the bland "I didn't". To have nothing reported after that two-line exchange, until the MAYDAY at 08:09:05, is a highly suspect omission from the interim report. In a two-crew cockpit, facing a sudden dual engine rollback just after rotation, I find it very hard to believe that this two-line exchange was the only interaction captured.

  That was with 10 seconds delay vs. 13 seconds for engine 2.

  <br/>
  Time was spent with the verbal exchange, and then perhaps each pilot expected the other to put the switch back?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anyway, the preliminary report also establishes that the aircraft had only 3-4 seconds of powered flight. (Would the gear lever be operated that early?) Everyone who saw that from the CCTV video, pat yourselves on the back.

  Mayday call, dual engine failure, RAT deployment all confirmed.
  <br/>
  TCMA was a red herring, the aircraft was firmly in air mode as the accident unfolded, and the thrust levers were at takeoff thrust the whole time.

  If I recall correctly, the Mayday call was wording to the effect "thrust not achieved". That sounds like a phrase which could be expected from a pilot who had just frantically tried to restart an engine, and realized that it was not a success, and there would not be an opportunity for another attempt. The pilot aviated, (forget navigation), then communicated - over a period of 13 seconds.

  I believe the 'thrust not achieved' was that one made up by a journalist - happy to be corrected.

  Sounds like #1 was restarting successfully but they just didn't have enough time for it to get back to high thrust.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  #2 may or may not have eventually started successfully; the extra two seconds of no fuel meant it would be a much harder start for the FADEC.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It doesn't sound like the crew have any input on the relight process; if the switch is on, the FADECs will try anything they can to get the engines lit and accelerating ASAP. Repeatedly switching between off and on will not help this process and there are basically no other controls the crew have, especially with no other power to run the engine starters.

  I don&rsquo;t know if the FDR measures the switch position or the electrical signal. The latter is probably more likely, although there has been much discussion around potential scenarios involving accidental switch movement as well as possible causes of electrical glitches. Let&rsquo;s assume that the switches were actually moved, and ignoring the &ldquo;bad faith&rdquo; scenario, we need a situation that encompasses the switches being moved to Cutoff by one pilot, this action being queried by the other pilot and denied by the pilot who moved the switches.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For consideration, here is a possible scenario that hasn&rsquo;t been mentioned yet and encompasses the frailty of human performance. The report mentions that the flight crew on the immediately prior flight had written up a "STAB POS XDCR" status message, and that troubleshooting was carried out.  I wonder if the scenario could be that the accident crew received a Stabiliser EICAS message on or around take-off and the Capt (who was PM) decided to action the first checklist item immediately from memory, by intending to move the Stab switches to Cutoff but moving the fuel switches instead. As in all modern Boeings, the Stabiliser Cutoff switches are immediately next to the Fuel Cutoff switches and operate in the same sense (i.e. down for Cutoff).  They are guarded and never normally moved but, with an intent to move the stab switches, &ldquo;muscle memory&rdquo; (cerebellum activation if you prefer) may have taken the Captain&rsquo;s hand to the Fuel switches, which are operated on every flight. The FO (who is PF) is manually flying at this stage sees and queries it. The Capt denies it, as he doesn&rsquo;t realise what he has done (confirmation bias perhaps). After a few seconds, the terrible mistake is realised, and the fuel switches are moved back to run, but sadly too late and the Capt makes a Mayday call.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Perhaps a bit of a stretch but not as much of a stretch as many of the other scenarios in this thread. I think it is a real possibility. Sadly, the only other explanation that I can see is the deliberate &ldquo;bad faith&rdquo; scenario, which we would all hope is incorrect.

  This is pure speculation but I can envision the following sequence of events that would match the timeline and the little we know from the CVR and sequence of events.
  <br/>
  - While PF is concentrated on flying the airplane, PNF moves the switches from RUN to CUTOFF in quick succession (for whatever reason).
  <br/>
  - PF doesn't notice that the switches have been moved (again, he is concentrated on flying) but soon perceives the loss of thrust and sees a message on EICAS.
  <br/>
  - PF looks down to check throttle position. It takes him a couple seconds to realize that the switches are in CUTOFF position.
  <br/>
  - PF asks PNF (and his superior) "Why did you cut off the engines?" (or something similar). PNF anwers that he didn't (a lie, but we don't know if deliberate or just confusion / mental breakdown)
  <br/>
  - PF realizes that PNF is in a wrong mental state, and attempts to restart the engines. It takes him a couple of seconds to move both switches because his other hand is on the yoke trying to stabilize the airplane.
  <br/>
  - By then the airplane has lost too much energy for a successful recovery. One of the pilots calls MAYDAY because he knows that they are about to crash.
  <br/>
  This sequence would match the timeline between the initial fuel cutoff, and when the switches were moved back to run position, and would actually indicate great presence of mind and quick decision from the PF.
  <br/>
  Again, this is pure speculation but it would match well with the little information we have.

     I don\x92t know if the FDR measures the switch position or the electrical signal. The latter is probably more likely, although there has been much discussion around potential scenarios involving accidental switch movement as well as possible causes of electrical glitches. Let\x92s assume that the switches were actually moved, and ignoring the \x93bad faith\x94 scenario, we need a situation that encompasses the switches being moved to Cutoff by one pilot, this action being queried by the other pilot and denied by the pilot who moved the switches. For consideration, here is a possible scenario that hasn\x92t been mentioned yet and encompasses the frailty of human performance. The report mentions that the flight crew on the immediately prior flight had written up a "STAB POS XDCR" status message, and that troubleshooting was carried out.
     <b>
      I wonder if the scenario could be that the accident crew received a Stabiliser EICAS message on or around take-off
     </b>
     and the Capt (who was PM) decided to action the first checklist item immediately from memory, by intending to move the Stab switches to Cutoff but moving the fuel switches instead. As in all modern Boeings, the Stabiliser Cutoff switches are immediately next to the Fuel Cutoff switches and operate in the same sense (i.e. down for Cutoff). They are guarded and never normally moved but, with an intent to move the stab switches, \x93muscle memory\x94 (cerebellum activation if you prefer) may have taken the Captain\x92s hand to the Fuel switches, which are operated on every flight. The FO (who is PF) is manually flying at this stage sees and queries it. The Capt denies it, as he doesn\x92t realise what he has done (confirmation bias perhaps). After a few seconds, the terrible mistake is realised, and the fuel switches are moved back to run, but sadly too late and the Capt makes a Mayday...

  A plausible theory, however, if that were indeed the case wouldn't supporting FDR data be available/have been included in the initial report?
