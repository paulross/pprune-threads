  If tower is not looking a radio call would advise someone there is about to be a big issue and getting services notified asap giving best chance ? In this case it may of made little difference ?

  Brakes would be hot at that ground temp . Long taxi , back track and turn , turnaround time may have been short enough to have residue heat in brakes ? Do they have brake fans , or portable brake fans . If no terrain issue then maybe gear down was planned to let brakes cool ?
  <br/>
  Any change to normal flow and having to remember things are different can cause issues . ie triggered to put something up after take off ?

     Are you thinking of the EK A340 that departed with a 100 ton descepancy entered in the box resulting in incorrect thrust derate and under cooked V speeds? That aircraft was saved by the flight crew that fire walled the thrust leavers with about 600M remaining. Tail strike and destroyed the LOC antenta, but was able to get Airbourne then return for landing at YMML. Is this a possibility? 100 ton gross error, resulting in incorrect thrust, speeds and flap setting? Pilot mistakes lack of thrust for partial engine failure? The confusion and startle factor as the aircraft is rotating with a surprising lack of thrust and the runway end fast approaching may account for the gear not being selected up. If there were a gross error in the weight entered in the FMC, no takeoff config warning. 40 degrees C, flaps 5 instead of flaps 15 or similar? Hopefully some initial data from the FDR may be a pretty good indication.

  Hard to imagine if that mistake was made he\x92d get on the radio saying engines losing power with out pushing levers up first ? What ever happened had  guy in left seat stunned ? My opinion only , if he was a training Capt he , like most guys in the left keep a good watch on where hands go . If an incorrect weight, chances are he\x92d know on runway and thrust to TOGA , those engines appear to be along way off producing thrust . If flap was raised by mistake , flap can be lowered just as quick . He\x92d not be on radio saying thrust decreasing while looking at flap up . If miss set alt hold he\x92d be calling modes and selecting higher altitude and changing  climb mode thinking he\x92s got to remember to write a report on arrival . If engines turned off deliberately!! Big If , no need for radio calls , turn engines back on and protect them and try isolating flight controls, if possible .
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If RAT out ??? That tells a lot .
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Not long to wait now ?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  condolences to family\x92s and loved ones !

     There have been conflicting reports about the call to ATC. Original reports quoted the Captain saying "Mayday...no thrust, losing power, cannot lift". But I've seen reports today stating the call was simply "Mayday, Mayday" and then no further response.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Difficult to confirm so I wouldn't put too much weight behind it until something more official is released.

  2 separate calls ? Last one just mayday mayday ? In this context reporting of power failure is engines not electrical , an electrical failure at that point would be of little interest compared to engines providing no thrust . My thoughts only but if he knew what had caused engines to stop producing thrust he\x92d not be on the radio . I think he\x92d be trying to reverse the cause ? Unlikely an experienced LTC would not see two handles / switches off ?

    If the take off weight was wrong he&rsquo;d have pushed the levers up.

   <li>
    If the flaps were retracted he&rsquo;d have firewalled the levers.

    If engine failed he&rsquo;d have pushed levers up and if incorrect engine shut down he&rsquo;d not be talking on radio .

    Rat out , apu opening and gear not coming up, the aircraft knew there was no power.

    Those engines stopped, and he never knew why?
