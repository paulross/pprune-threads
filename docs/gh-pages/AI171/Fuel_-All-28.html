   Was the RAT deployed manually?

  <br>
   The report says,
   <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
    <i>
     As per the EAFR data both engines N2 values passed below minimum idle speed, and the
    </i>
    <i>

   This was 5 seconds after the fuel was cut off.
   <br>
    <br>
     It suggests to me that the RAT deployment was initiated while the engines were still above idle and generating electrical power. Obviously one of the pilots could have done it via depressing the switch, as it's a "dual engine failure/stall" memory item (see
     <a href="https://www.pprune.org/accidents-close-calls/666581-air-india-ahmedabad-accident-12th-june-2025-part-2-a-70.html#post11918946" target="_blank">

     ) that won't hurt anything.
     <br>
      <br>
       Is there a way for the RAT to deploy while the engines are still above idle?

  <br/>
  <br/>
  This extract from the datasheet of the Honeywell switch installed in the B787 for switching between Cut Off and Run shows the various gates that can be incorporated in such a switch.  I suspect that it is Configuration D which allows the switch to be in one or other of only 2 positions.  But the centre gate has a relatively wide flat table on which the switch can rest if it is not moved correctly to either the Run or Cut Off position.  I therefore think that it is not beyond the realm of possibility that both switches may have initially been resting on the gate and then slipped into the cut off position during take off.  However, what militates against this theory are the words of the challenge, "Why did you do that?" suggesting that one pilot had seen the other pilot actually flip the switches.

     When I was a young F/O, some of the captains I flew with had the (annoying) habit of resting their hands just behind the thrust levers on their PM (PNF) sectors to 'be ready' to reject the takeoff. This would put the hands in the vicinity of the Fuel Cutoffs, which would, in turn, increase the chances of an unintended action on these switches. Is this a possibility, or am I way off?

  Good question as the report says FAA advisory NM-18-33 (check for potential fuel cut-off switches fault) was not implemented by Air India.

     The report mentions that the immediate prior flight crew had written up a "STAB POS XDCR" status message, and that troubleshooting was carried out.
     <br/>
     Is it possible that the troubleshooting/diagnostics left the stab cutout switches on the pedestal in the cutoff position, which went unnoticed until liftoff (i.e. upon noticing that the trim wasn't operable), resulting in a reach towards those switches, which are situated right next to the engine cutoff switches?
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  That seems to me to be a very feasible possibility. Noticing, then accidentally hittting the wrong thing in a quick reaction, especially during a possibly bumpy take-off, then only realsing as power starts to die away... A very simple human error possibility - and the switch location makes it horribly easy, especially ofthe switch locking is dubious. Ergonomics and human factors in design? In a very different environment many years ago I was involved in investigating somethimg rather similar (though not deadly). Taught me a lot about operational human factors and our design assumptions...
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's possible, damn it. How dreadful if correct.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That is also a worrying place to put vital switches. Handy place to rest your arm. I have one person I fly with who tends to rest his hand right on the flap lever (light aircraft) if he is not handling the aircraft. I really don't like that. It's bit like my current car, which has the handbrake 'switch'(!) on the central console, behind the gear lever. Just right for accidental operation - and it has been done.

  Well, speaking of fuel-cut switches, I read
  <a href="https://ad.easa.europa.eu/blob/NM-18-33.pdf/SIB_NM-18-33_1" target="_blank">
   NM-18-33 SAIB
  </a>
  with attention, and as a not-that-fluent english speaker, I stumbled on this sentence (my bold):
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <div style="margin:1rem; margin-top:0.3rem;">
   <div>
    <label>
     Quote:
    </label>
   </div>
   <div class="panel alt2" style="border:1px inset">
    If the locking feature is
    <b>
     disengaged
    </b>
    , the switch can be moved between the two positions without lifting the switch during transition, and the switch would be exposed to the potential of inadvertent operation.
   </div>
  </div>
  I could hardly figure what the "disengaged" word meant in this context, so I did a Google search for the switch part numbers (especially "766AT614-3D") to figure the difference between them, and
  <a href="https://www.xuefeiji.org/bbs/show-294.html" target="_blank">
   a page from this chinese web site
  </a>
  was part of the results.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And while I was painfully crawling the thread, I noticed the following picture about an "undesirable condition":
  <br/>
  <img alt="Incorrect tab lock position on fuel cut-off switch" class="post_inline_image" src="https://cimg5.ibsrv.net/gimg/pprune.org-vbulletin/1080x608/incorrect_tab_lock_position_9906fd39e1804a4a1111e4d245fc5f4f5001be0c.jpeg"/>
  <br/>
  <i>
   Incorrect lock tab position on fuel cut-off switch
  </i>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If this incorrect mounting is actually possible, it would possibly remain unnoticed from the pilots (normal "pull-up then move" action is unaffected), but it would cancel the protective function of the so-called "locking tab", and even limit the travel of the switch handle in both directions, making it more vulnerable to an undesired change of state.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The photos above seem convincing enough, but I'd be very grateful for an informed opinion on this assembly mistake. Even if this is possible, the probability of
  <b>
   both
  </b>
  switches being unexpectedly snapped seems very remote to say the least, but not as remote as previously estimated.

  The only people proposing that something jammed or fell on the fuel shutoff switches, causing them to move to cutoff, are those that have never ever come close to physically touching these switches for real. Everyone who operates these switches every day, says it&rsquo;s almost an impossibly, and that the switches had to be manually moved to cutoff.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Given the fuel shutoff switches were moved back to run, and then subsequently survived the entire crash without moving position, I think the &ldquo;iPhone/credit card moved them&rdquo; theory can be put to bed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Maybe it&rsquo;s time some of those who lack the knowledge and experience of operating jet aircraft stop and listen to those that do. Even if they don&rsquo;t like what they hear.

  As a non pilot, I find this statement in the report interesting (in it's inclusion if nothing else), but I assume that this reference to the replacement module in 2023 (the module including the fuel cutoff switches?)  we view as pretty irrelevant to cause?

  I would say practically impossible. Assuming there was somebody on board who happened to want to take their own life in spectacular fashion in the first place, the door would still be closed and therefore locked, and an MEL procedure would be in place (on the Airbus it would be to physically look through the door viewer) before opening/unlocking.

     Helicopter pilot here - we don\x92t have flight deck doors, so please excuse\x85 I notice there was an MEL entry for the flight deck door surveillance system inop. Would a possible consequence of that be that the crew decided not to lock the door, and thus a cockpit intruder could have entered and moved the switches to cut-off, out of line of sight of the pilots?
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  No, that's an impossible scenario.
  <br/>
  But you do have a point here. If the Flight Deck Door Surveillance system was inoperative, perhaps Air India has a procedure requiring someone to be in the flight deck to check the spy hole before opening the door? Just a thought.

  I still think it should be possible to identify the voices from the CVR. During taxi out with P2 as pilot flying the exchanges between them should be obvious as to who is speaking. Thus the identity of the pilot asking about cut off would become clear.

     Well, speaking of fuel-cut switches, I read
     <a href="https://ad.easa.europa.eu/blob/NM-18-33.pdf/SIB_NM-18-33_1" target="_blank">
      NM-18-33 SAIB
     </a>
     with attention, and as a not-that-fluent english speaker, I stumbled on this sentence (my bold):
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I could hardly figure what the "disengaged" word meant in this context, so I did a Google search for the switch part numbers (especially "766AT614-3D") to figure the difference between them, and
     <a href="https://www.xuefeiji.org/bbs/show-294.html" target="_blank">
      a page from this chinese web site
     </a>
     was part of the results.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     And while I was painfully crawling the thread, I noticed the following picture about an "undesirable condition":
     <br/>
     <img alt="Incorrect tab lock position on fuel cut-off switch" class="post_inline_image" src="https://cimg5.ibsrv.net/gimg/pprune.org-vbulletin/1080x608/incorrect_tab_lock_position_9906fd39e1804a4a1111e4d245fc5f4f5001be0c.jpeg"/>
     <br/>
     <i>
      Incorrect lock tab position on fuel cut-off switch
     </i>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     If this incorrect mounting is actually possible, it would possibly remain unnoticed from the pilots (normal "pull-up then move" action is unaffected), but it would cancel the protective function of the so-called "locking tab", and even limit the travel of the switch handle in both directions, making it more vulnerable to an undesired change of state.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The photos above seem convincing enough, but I'd be very grateful for an informed opinion on this assembly mistake. Even if this is possible, the probability of
     <b>
      both
     </b>
     switches being unexpectedly snapped seems very remote to say the least, but not as remote as previously estimated.
    </div>

  <a href="https://ad.easa.europa.eu/blob/NM-18-33.pdf/SIB_NM-18-33_1" target="_blank">
   NM-18-33 SAIB
  </a>
  left me wondering the same thing.  It give a procedure for detecting the defect but omits to explain the cause.  I was thinking that the wrong switches had been supplied/fitted.  Assuming the image from the Chinese web site is correct, it is disappointing that the actuator can get into that state.  I did not see anything that said whether that was how the switch arrived from Honeywell or if there was a defect that allowed the actuator to turn.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One other useful thing from that web site is a partial schematic which shows the connection of the 4 poles in the switch.  I believe this is from a 737NG but it should be the same idea.
  <br/>

  SLF.  But I've read in full both original threads and this thread.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Preliminary Report is written in excellent English, so I think one should pay close attention to what it says.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One thing I noticed is that at the bottom of P4 NTSB are stated as "..participated in the investigation".  However UK AAIB are only stated as "visited the site".  My reading is that UK AAIB are not participating?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another is that some items on the timescale are v precise, others much more vague.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A question :
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If the fuel switches were moved to cutoff, for whatever reason, what exactly would each pilot see as an EICAS warning.  I'm still unclear why one pilot asked the other why he cut off - actual observation of the action, or message.

  SLF: I have a small observation but I'm not sure what it means or if it has any relevance to the accident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Previously I had assumed that the ADS-B data cut out at the same time as power was lost, so I imagined that whatever caused the fairly clear loss of thrust would have happened not too long before. But this report throws a bit of a wrench in my understanding of that.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the report, the fuel cutoff switches transition from RUN to CUTOFF at or very shortly after 08:08:42 UTC. Both engines' N2 values pass below minimum idle speed and the RAT begins supplying hydraulic power at about 08:08:47. Does this not imply that the generators have already been lost? With the APU also being off (the APU inlet door is noted to start opening at 08:08:54), I would have expected ADS-B data to cut out at or before 08:08:47. But curiously FlightRadar24 at least claims to have received data frames from the aircraft until 08:08:51.640970, almost five seconds later and almost ten seconds after the transition to CUTOFF (though the last frame containing coordinates comes at 08:08:50.871005).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Could anyone with relevant experience confirm how long it would take for AC power to be lost in this situation? Also, is it usual/unusual for a preliminary report like this to mention if/when the flight recorder switched to its independent power supply? I imagine it would definitely be in the final report, but I'd hoped it would be easily observable enough to be in this one.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beyond idle curiosity I'm asking because the report
  <i>
   also
  </i>
  says the no. 1 engine's cutoff switch transitioned from CUTOFF to RUN at "about 08:08:52", which oddly coincides with the last ADS-B data frame at 08:08:51.640970, and that seems important somehow. Or more likely I'm just ignorant of some quirk of the 787's electrical system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For reference FR24's CSV containing all ADS-B frames supposedly received from the aircraft can be found in their post here:

  There is a lot of grasping at straws in this thread. It seems pretty simple to me and only one explanation that fits the evidence. About three seconds after takeoff the Captain noted the FO turn of the fuel cutoff switches. He immediately questioned that for obvious reasons and the FO replied he did not again for reasons that seem obvious to me. He did not want it on the tape and he wanted to delay the Captain in trying to switch them back on. Had the fuel cutoff switches been restored immediately before the engines unspooled the accident would have been avoided. In addition the timing of the cutoff switches movement is exactly what you would expect if the copilot was using one hand trying to be discreet in his actions.

   This might have been discussed but as has been suggested upthread; a possible scenario is that at some point, PIC took their hands off the thrust levers and/or placed them in a guarding position behind the thrust levers at their base - but by doing so unfortunately nudged the Fuel cut-off switches to 'Off' - perhaps 'helped' by there either being incorrectly fitted locking mechanisms or worn locking mechanisms ?

  3 possibilities come to mind:
  <br>
   <br/>
   1. Pilot who moved fuel switches to off did not do so intentionally to cause the outcome, but for some reason unknown (extreme fatigue, medical condition, medication/drug) somehow confused the action of retracting gear with shutdown procedure at end of flight.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   2. Unthinkably, but very possibly, pilot who moved fuel switches did so intentionally, likely planned ahead of time to catch out other pilot at a moment where focus was intently on flying &amp; recovery most unlikely. Mental illness, drug use, personal circumstances behind it.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   3. Something extraordinary which was never encountered before which caused or allowed fuel switches to move on their own.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   When both pilots flying &amp; personal history is investigated, more is likely to emerge, maybe something to support possibility 1 above, where a pilot had on some previous occasions got sequences confused, or suffered brief episodes of  seizures whee he took strange actions.
