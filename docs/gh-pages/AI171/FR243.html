  FR24 has the GPS lat long position at each time - ground speed is then simply distance travelled over the time interval. The METAR quoted 25007KT and that should increase with height hence the nominal decrease in ground speed over the later ADS-B values - and probably the slight drift off the centre line once airborne.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An earlier poster defined the 787 ADS-B transmits with a height granularity of 25' - which explains the FR24 figures and I might posit that it was just about to transmit a 25' height increase when the electrical failure occurred.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rooftop video records a nominal
  <b>
   14s
  </b>
  flight time with RAT out throughout.
  <br/>
  The CCTV video records a nominal
  <b>
   32s
  </b>
  (from rotation) and subjectively the aircraft stops climbing
  <b>
   14s
  </b>
  after rotation - meaning
  <b>
   18s
  </b>
  of descent of which
  <b>
   14s
  </b>
  are captured in the rooftop video.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If we accept the RAT is out then it must have been deployed about
  <b>
   12-16s
  </b>
  after rotation, presumably immediately after the 4s of ADS-B data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another post referenced the RAT only supplying electrical power after 10s - I find that hard to believe, not instant obviously because there has to be some stabilisation time and startup/boot time but it would imply the LH flight instruments would only be active very late. Hopefully the RAT hydraulics would be effective quicker than that.

     Which media sources? (Article source and date would be helpful).
     <br/>
     Any number of posts in both threads have offered the estimation that the flight would have not had additional fuel, and thus a "fill all the way up with fuel" assumption wasn't warranted.
     <br/>
     If the reports you mention are credible (rather than mere speculation and rumor) that would be of interest.
     <br/>
     The actual fuel load will, in time, be known once the FDR info is processes in full.

  Yes PLEASE! I'm a Journalist and a (Private) Pilot and find it incredibly frustrating when people post quotes from "sources" without revealing the source of the quote with a link to the original article. No link? I ignore the post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There is way too much misinformation floating around nowadays and I don't want to read it on this forum. PPRUNE has been a fantastic source of knowledge for me personally - especially leading up to my PPL exams in 2006.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Back then I could trust much of what I read on here. Thankfully the mods do a fantastic job and manage to weed out most of the nonsense but it takes time and I think it puts off many of the legit professional flyers from posting here.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  What also winds me up is the amount of posters including YouTube links to dubious channels invariably presented by old blokes wearing epaulettes and claiming to be professional pilots. I wish these links could be banned. YouTube is not a source of news. It's a public website where anyone can post any old rubbish and pretend that it's real when it isn't. It worries me that so many people assume that "because it's on YouTube it must be correct"!
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And FR24. It's a commercial website for aircraft spotters. It is not an accurate source of information for professional flyers. If I see a poster linking to it I ignore them as well.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It really is quite difficult now to "sort the wheat from the chaff" particularly on threads devoted to aircraft accidents. Thank you MODS for making it slightly more bearable!

  FR24 has, at the last count, 3 fundamental issues with the way it reports and displays data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All are readily worked around, after which what's left is the same data that underpins many of today's ATC systems.
