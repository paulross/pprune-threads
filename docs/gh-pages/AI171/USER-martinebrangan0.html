     I am seeing a discussion of what occurred after the aircraft left the runway rather what may have occurred before the aircraft left the runway.

  trouble is we have no evidence of anything at all about the start-up, taxi, roll etc. No pax videos inside or outside the windows to disclose unusual noises, announcements or anything. Not yet.,

     Which aircraft are you referring to where this has happened in the past?
     <br/>
     Is there an incident (or your experience in a sim session?) that you can refer to?

  Butting in here in here with a link that suggests previous issues with 787 seats:

     Engine failure due to water contamination is surely a different investigation to biocide contamination? I expect they're looking into both, but they're not that closely linked.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Surprising that you can do nearly a minute of takeoff+climbout then fail cleanly and silently within seconds of each other.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I would, of course, presume, that take-off roll performance was within expected limits, otherwise they would have aborted by V1. They reached VR before running totally out of runway, and achieved a short-lasting climb. What one single point of failure occurred very shortly after aircraft went nose-up and would it be possible that the fuel feed in some way affected by virtue of that angle in the context of some failure?

  3 possibilities come to mind:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  1. Pilot who moved fuel switches to off did not do so intentionally to cause the outcome, but for some reason unknown (extreme fatigue, medical condition, medication/drug) somehow confused the action of retracting gear with shutdown procedure at end of flight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  2. Unthinkably, but very possibly, pilot who moved fuel switches did so intentionally, likely planned ahead of time to catch out other pilot at a moment where focus was intently on flying &amp; recovery most unlikely. Mental illness, drug use, personal circumstances behind it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  3. Something extraordinary which was never encountered before which caused or allowed fuel switches to move on their own.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When both pilots flying &amp; personal history is investigated, more is likely to emerge, maybe something to support possibility 1 above, where a pilot had on some previous occasions got sequences confused, or suffered brief episodes of  seizures whee he took strange actions.

     It's established fact both fuel control switches moved to CUTOFF 4 seconds after Vr, a deliberate guarded action, not easily done accidentally.
     <br/>
     The CVR records one pilot asking \x93Why did you cut off?\x94, the other replies \x93I didn\x92t\x94. Then a bland Mayday attributed to the Captain \x93engine failure, returning\x94 in the middle of the crisis.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The language, if reported correctly, feels strangely detached. No confusion, no urgency, no clear troubleshooting. Not drawing conclusions, but does anyone else see signs of performative behaviour, that is saying the right things outwardly, while being at odds with the underlying cause?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I appreciate that both crew members lost their lives, however if we avoid discussing uncomfortable patterns, we miss the point of investigation and learning.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  in that fraught moment of engines not functioning very close to the ground, the last thing to do at this critical moment when you don\x92t really known what has happened is communicate a MayDay. With the buildings looming up fast, the action required is to attempt to restart, as seems to have been done by a pilot putting the fuel switch to \x93run\x94, but too late to rescue aircraft. I think the timing of the MayDay call is strange given that the scenario called for Aviate, Navigate\x85 then Communicate.
