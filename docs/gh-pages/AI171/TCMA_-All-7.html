     Pretty sure that the (RR) after that TCMA entry means it is only applicable to Rolls Royce engines. I believe the accident aircraft had GE engines?

     I'm honestly mystified by the obsession with TCMA. The FADECs control almost every aspect of the engines, so there must be numerous ways they could cause a failure or uncommanded shutdown. So, even if we assume that the engines failed due to faults in the FADECs, why assume that TCMA would be involved? Surely it's more logical to simply posit that some unspecified bug in the FADEC software caused the failure. That bug
     <i>
      could
     </i>
     be related to TCMA, but it could just as easily involve any one of the dozens of other subroutines that likely exist.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Various posters seem to assume that all it takes is an incorrect air/ground signal, and the engines would shut down. But in fact it would also require the FADECs to read the thrust levers as being at or near idle... AND the engines failing to respond to closure of the fuel metering valve. I've read the entirety of both threads, and I haven't seen anyone even attempt to explain how a malfunction within the airframe could cause both of those things to occur on both engines (or even one engine!).
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  There is at least one thing common to the TCMA on each engine: The TCMA software.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  My recollection may be inaccurate, but wasn't there something in the software for 787 generator control units that would cause generator shut down if the aircraft was 'powered up' for a continuous 248 days? Same software, so all 4 generators would shut down. Is my recollection inaccurate?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  What we do know, for sure, is that the TCMAs have the same 'authority' and effect as the fuel cut-off switches. The difference is that the crew control the latter.

  We have two donks individual fuel supply cut simultaneous in split seconds. There is no rudder activity visible for any thrust asymmetry during this timeframe. TCMA is implemented via the FADECs which are independent for each engine with their own power source from each engine. TCMA is designed to shut down its engine if its power lever is in retard position and the engine is still powering with too much thrust. In addition the airplanes ground sensors must indicate that it is on the ground. For each thrust leaver there are two independent position sensors. It is similar redundant designed as in modern car acceleration pedals. A dual redundancy in each thrust leaver. For TCMA to shut down two fuel supplies within split seconds we have to assume that 4 thrust leaver sensors malfunctioned and the ground sensing logic failed at the same time. The probability that this happens is nil (may be 1 in every 10exp15 hours) which would be about 10 times the age of our universe.
  <br/>
  Unless there is a software error in the FADEC TCMA system which only came to light on this flight. But there seem to be nothing special on this flight until rotation. If there is a software error I expect, that we get false single engine shut downs first. And that would already made the news if it happened during rotation.

     Thanks tdracer and EXDAC for the info re the throttle position resolvers (and I'm aware of what is "
     <span style="color:#000000">
      well understood by those who specify, design, test, and certify critical aircraft systems", EXDAC). But do the separate resolver outputs involve physically separated wiring through separate looms and connectors and, if there are any earths or power connections involved, are they at separate points and, in the case of power connections, on separate busses? Duplicated, supposedly completely independent, "designed, tested and certified critical aircraft systems" occasionally have a common, single point of failure, not as a consequence of bad theoretical design but, rather, physical implementation.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      And what of the weight on wheel sensor inputs to the 4 TCMA channels (2 per engine)? 4 separate sensors with 4 separated sets of wiring in different looms through different connectors?
     </span>
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  The wiring between the two (per engine) FADEC channels is separate and isolated from each other.  In the areas potentially subject to cross engine rotor burst damage, that wiring is physically separated by a considerable distance.  About the only place where the Channel A and B thrust lever resolver wiring is close proximity is in the thrust lever quadrant.  We've been designing FADEC aircraft for 40 years - and the requirements for isolation are detailed and well understood.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I've
  <i>
   repeatedly
  </i>
  posted I don't know the details of the 787/GEnx-1B FADEC air/ground logic - and I know even less about the 787 air/ground system architecture.  That being said, I think the whole air/ground is a bit of a red herring - even with a false air/ground indication, it's going to take a very major flaw in the FADEC logic for TCMA to activate without several other things happening (such as the thrust levers being moved to idle - which all by itself is going to make for a bad day if it's done at rotation).

  I'm pretty sure the software is written independently. Same as Airbus, you don't want the same software error on duplicate critical systems.

  I'm not sure I've understood what you're saying, TURIN. Are you saying that the software that controls the TCMA A and B channel relays on one engine is written by someone different from whoever writes the software that controls the TCMA A and B channel relays on the other engine? If so, I've learned something very important today.

  And so the wheel starts again. That was covered by tdracer in the earlier thread: Both channels of FADEC and thus TCMA run the same software from the one and only source code.

     Perhaps the safer solution should be an additional circuitry micro-switch feed of all three "up and locked"? (that agrees with the gear-handle).
     <br/>
     Also waiting to hear what the 787-8 RADALT status is? Was it ever 5G emanations-proofed?
     <br/>
     Is there any software provision for the TCMA to know for sure that the gear is neither up nor down? I would doubt it. Does that uncertainty affect the thrust-lever's positional input?
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  If the 787 is not different to all other aircaft, the WoW senses and putouts only one parameter that is always 1 or 0. There is no netherlands in between. The physical motion the switch is sensing migh have not reach it other end at the time the switch changes its output, but it is irrevelant. If there is a requirement to know that the motion has reaches it\x92s other end, another switch (or other type of sensor) is needed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Using up and locked as signal to prevent TCMA activation is obviously more dangerous as it allows TCMA to function while the aircraft is in the air.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Even in the same aircraft there might be different logics to determin if the aicraft is on the ground or in the air, depending what is the priority. Is the priority to know that the aircraft is in the air or on the ground or even NOT in the air. Some of those logics could use up-and-locked sensors and the gear handle position.

  Not an avionics specialist, but electronics / software engineer here, with extensive experience in hardware fault tracking, protocol monitoring and software debugging in embedded systems : mods, feel free to delete this post if I am completely out of track (and thank you for the huge amount of work you've done trying to keep this discussion clean).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After I have read the whole thread, I think most of the community agrees about a lack of engine thrust being the cause of the crash. Searching in that direction, I'm trying to "think out of the box", discarding the usual suspects (birds ingestion, TCMA, human mistake...), and to find a plausible single point of failure among the various subsystems involved. I was thinking of reversing the causality of the event, i.e. exploring a case where the engines would have behaved unexpectedly because of a major electrical failure, instead of the already explored case where both powerplants went AWOL first.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Therefore, I have a couple questions for tdracer / fdr / other informed contributors (BTW, fantastic contribution guys, please keep the good info coming):
  <br/>
  <br/>
  1. From the scarce info available, is it reasonable to conclude that the engines were totally shut down? Could they have just been set to idle or reduced thrust instead?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  2. In the second case, if (and that's a big IF) a major electrical failure happened first (which could have triggered RAT deployment), and considering this plane is a FBW aircraft, could there exist a case where the FADECs would command idle thrust -- or significant thrust reduction -- because they receive invalid input data from the throttle controls? Kind of a garbage in-garbage out case?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The associated scenario would be: major electrical fault (with subsequent RAT deployment) -&gt; major protocol disturbance on ARINC/AFDX buses -&gt; FADECs detect invalid data from the controls -&gt; FADECS enter some kinf of safe mode and command reduced or idle thrust.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Does it make sense or is it pure fantasy?

     <br/>
     After I have read the whole thread, I think most of the community agrees about a lack of engine thrust being the cause of the crash. Searching in that direction, I'm trying to "think out of the box", discarding the usual suspects (birds ingestion, TCMA, human mistake...), and to find a plausible single point of failure among the various subsystems involved. I was thinking of reversing the causality of the event, i.e. exploring a case where the engines would have behaved unexpectedly because of a major electrical failure, instead of the already explored case where both powerplants went AWOL first.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Therefore, I have a couple questions for tdracer / fdr / other informed contributors (BTW, fantastic contribution guys, please keep the good info coming):
     <br/>
     <br/>
     1. From the scarce info available, is it reasonable to conclude that the engines were totally shut down? Could they have just been set to idle or reduced thrust instead?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     2. In the second case, if (and that's a big IF) a major electrical failure happened first (which could have triggered RAT deployment), and considering this plane is a FBW aircraft, could there exist a case where the FADECs would command idle thrust -- or significant thrust reduction -- because they receive invalid input data from the throttle controls? Kind of a garbage in-garbage out case?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The associated scenario would be: major electrical fault (with subsequent RAT deployment) -&gt; major protocol disturbance on ARINC/AFDX buses -&gt; FADECs detect invalid data from the controls -&gt; FADECS enter some kinf of safe mode and command reduced or idle thrust.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Does it make sense or is it pure fantasy?
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  No. The throttle position sensors (dual per engine) are part of the FADEC. The throttle position data is not transmitted through the ARINC busses of the aircraft.

  In that report, the factual conclusion is:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <i>
   4. PROBABLE CAUSES
   <br/>
   In this serious incident, it is highly probable that, when the Aircraft was descending for
   <br/>
   landing, there occurred oscillation in rpm of each engine causing both engines to temporarily fall
   <br/>
   below idle
   <b>
    at separate times
   </b>
   because Residue primarily composed of magnesium salts accumulated
   <br/>
   in spools impeded movement of spools that involved in fuel metering of both engines.
  </i>
  (emphasis added)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  and the narrative taken from the pilots is that while they happened in short order, the engine issues were not simultaneous. Not to say they
  <i>
   couldn't
  </i>
  be simultaneous, but they weren't. Also, the problems arose in the descent, as the engines were throttled back. Again, not to say it
  <i>
   couldn't
  </i>
  happen in the take-off, under full power.

     I was in this business long enough to know that you 'never say never', it would take a pretty gross error in the TCMA logic for it to have activated without a large thrust lever movement.

     I'm honestly mystified by the obsession with TCMA. The FADECs control almost every aspect of the engines, so there must be numerous ways they could cause a failure or uncommanded shutdown. So, even if we assume that the engines failed due to faults in the FADECs, why assume that TCMA would be involved?
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I think you may be inferring something that isn't actually true. It certainly isn't true in my case. Wanting to explore the details of a function known to be designed to shut down engines, in a case where unexplained shutdown of engines appears to be a likely cause or contributing factor, doesn't suggest that we are assuming TCMA is involved. It's just exploring the details of a a function that is designed to do that and doesn't put on a light, smoke and sound show, or produce obvious debris and residue, when it does.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I think those of us who are persistently trying to learn the details of the sensor inputs to and logic of TCMA (I prefer that characterization to "obsessed with") understand quite well the points you make here &mdash; at least those of us whose interest survives in this new thread. However, I at least, and I believe others as well, have also come to the tentative conclusions that (a) the accident aircraft had engines providing little to no useful thrust from nearly the first moments after rotation, and (b) the only possible reasons for that which have been considered here so far involve the sudden and approximately simultaneous shutdown of those engines, most likely by interruption of fuel flow (because that's one of the very few things we know that can do that without producing big bangs, flames and smoke, etc.).

    Surely it's more logical to simply posit that some unspecified bug in the FADEC software caused the failure. That bug
    <i>
     could

    be related to TCMA, but it could just as easily involve any one of the dozens of other subroutines that likely exist.
   </div>
  </div>
  I don't agree that it's more logical to posit that something we don't know about has shut down the engines rather than something that we do know about that is intended to shut down engines. Do you know of other routines/subroutines in the FADEC that shut down fuel supply?

    But in fact it would also require the FADECs to read the thrust levers as being at or near idle... AND the engines failing to respond to closure of the fuel metering valve.

  Right, and you won't see a serious attempt to do that until we know, at least, what specific sensor inputs the TCMA function uses to determine the air/ground state of the aircraft and the logic that uses those to make the determination.

  I agree with the post above (edited for brevity) - and fear the thread is getting repetitive in the absence of new information.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The only thing I would add is the limited
  <a href="https://www.flightradar24.com/blog/flight-tracking-news/major-incident/air-india-171-crashes-shortly-after-take-off-from-ahmedabad/" target="_blank">
   ADS-B data
  </a>
  I have seen shows the a/c decelerating rapidly from the first data point onwards. It is possible the shutdown occurred when the a/c was on the ground (e.g. after V1). This may seem unlikely given the distance flown, but you can do the maths - a fast a/c has a lot of stored kinetic energy.

  SLF. As usual feel free to ignore.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Being mere SLF, the knowledge that a mandatory system called TCMA even exists worries me a little. A system with authority to shut down (all) engines without any interference from one of the pilots should IMHO not exist in an airplane.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As described multiple times in the previous thread, TCMA uses data from multiple WoW sensors, ground radar and throttle imput. It is also described that TCMA will determine WoW status if ONE OR MORE of the WoW sensors senses WoW. Therefore it will only need one malfunctioning WoW sensor to determine WoW.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since, as I read in the previous thread, it also uses ground radar: what is its hysteresis in measuring ground proximity? In other words from what height after rotation does TCMA deem the airplane is not at ground level anymore? This feels like an important parameter to me.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If, during this accident, something happened during its takeoff roll (unexpected throttle movement for instance), could that have triggered TCMA to shut down (both) engines?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I hope not.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By the way, what is the time delay between TCMA detecting an abnormality and it switching off an engine?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  (If TCMA is somehow involved in this accident, a future change might be to disable TCMA after the airplane reaches a certain speed.)

  Having read this, and the earlier thread pretty much from beginning to end, my understanding is that several conditions need to be met for TCMA to intervene. WoW is just one of those conditions.

  Question to avionics specialists again. Below is the main drawing of the TCMA subsystem, included in
  <a href="https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/11/c0/6b/6dcf993795046a/US6704630.pdf" target="_blank">
   the patent document
  </a>
  . I can't stop scratching my head about the link I have circled in
  <b>
   <span style="color:#c0392b">
    red
   </span>
  </b>
  in the center of the image. AFAICS, this link shunts the internal RUN path of TCMA entirely : the RUN signal is supplied by the RUN contact of relay assembly 52, then goes through the common and RUN contacts of relay 22, then goes through the common and RUN contacts of relay 28, then exits TCMA subsystem 18 by wire 124, and... we're back to square 1, because of the link. So TCMA subsystem 18 doesn't actually control the OPEN relay 118 of the HPSOV, only the CLOSED relay 100, and in the case where relay 22 and/or 28 are activated, both coils of HPSOV could even be energized at the same time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Obviously enough, this isn't a real circuit diagram, but shouldn't this link be removed from the patent drawing?

  B787 Skipper.... No longer able to sit on my hands!
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The joker that published one or other of the fictional accident reports before the dead are even identified needs stringing up by the thumbs.... Well done mods.  OK, some of  these theories, just bearing in mind the the flight recorder (there is only one FDR + CVR combined) was in the intact section of the undamaged tail and has been with the authorities for almost five days......
  <br/>
  <br/>
  -  All you guys who are rushing down the TCMA rabbit hole:  If it was established that a software error drove both engines to idle without warning, after rotate.... Don't you think the worldwide fleet of B787s would have been grounded by now?  Such a glaring failure would be absolutely inescapable on the FDR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Whatever was wrong with this aircraft was present at rotate, unbeknown to the crew.  The fact that no ADs or notices to operators have been issued usually means that the cause is known and the aircraft was serviceable.  The statement from a prominent Indian Captain about the skill and tenacity of the crew, right up to the last minute is absolutely laudable.  However, the cynic in me says that the way is being paved for some bad news and by that I mean news that will do Air India reputational damage.  Expect more management of expectation in the coming days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I'm still going with
  <br/>
  a) Incorrect derate + low Vspeeds or
  <br/>
  b) Low altitude capture
