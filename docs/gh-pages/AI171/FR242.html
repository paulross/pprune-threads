     They had reached the maximum of 625 ft pressure altitude i.e 436 ft AGL. Must had been super quick in accomplishing the memory items. Just saying.ðŸ˜‡

  No, they did not climb that high. Latest FR24 ADS-B report was indeed 625 ft, but that is based on 1013 (STD). With the local QNH being 1000, that 625ft becomes roughly 300ft MSL. Corrected for airport elevation, this is just above 100ft. The last recorded altitude of the aircraft was roughly 100ft AGL, which does not mean it didn\x92t climb a bit higher, but the aircraft reaching 400ft is pure speculation.

     Based on the video taken from the left of the flight path, can we determine at what point of the runway rotation occurred? Is there positive confirmation that the takeoff roll started at the beginning of the runway ? Are the two indicative of trouble before rotation, as the Times states ?

  IMO, I don't know if that is trustworthy - the FR24 ADSB data seems to show that the aircraft was at 21ft AGL between the 1500ft and 2000ft markers from the end of the runway.

  I don't know if I'm allowed to post pictures - my last post with a picture didn't show up, so I'll try adding it separately from this one. It's basically an overlay of the FR24 blogpost map on a google maps satellite view of VAAH.

  The 787 in particular has a system that is fully automated for takeoff calculation. That includes Takeoff Distance, all relevant airspeeds, etc and uses combined sensor data to make pilot error in calculations exceedingly unlikely.

  <br/>
  In addition the valid settings for takeoff flaps simply begin at 5\xb0, so anything less isn't even offered. The corresponding alarms will thus always trigger if you don't have at least 5\xb0 flaps set upon setting takeoff thrust, possibly requiring a higher setting depending on the calculated takeoff configuration. As mentioned before in this thread the loading of the accident aircraft should have been far below its maximums, so a 5\xb0 flaps takeoff is quite ordinary, and the aircraft left the runway well short of its end.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also the aircraft used the entire runway after backtracking along it since there are no taxiways going that far. This information has been corrected by FR24 a while ago and stems from the incomplete GPS positional data that is inherent in ADS-B tracking, especially on the ground.

  Looking at the detailed ADS-B data released by FR24 and the June 10 AI171 data, I noticed that the two flights show the following data at similar points in the takeoff phase
  <br/>
  Height :575ft
  <br/>
  Speed :182kts
  <br/>
  Even though it is impossible that the takeoff weight and outside air conditions are the same on the two flights, we guess that there was nothing wrong at this moment.

  How does the 787 "manage thrust" after takeoff? The jet has only just left the ground; surely the throttles would be at maximum power and pitch would be used to attain and maintain V2 until the end of the second segment.

  Are you saying the pilot(
  <b>

  ) just sat there while the ATS reduced the thrust (because is all it could have done, as it was at maximum for the actual takeoff).

  Fixed on what? Or did it "decay" because the PF pulled the throttles back?

  There is no evidence the jet climbed too steeply; I assume you saw the granular FR24 plot (from FR24 itself) which showed the initial flight path of this one was in the middle of the range, and the video clearly shows a normal initial climb and deck angle before "the @#$% dropped out of it".

  So BOTH pilots just sat there, didn't pull the gear up, did nothing else and crashed it (pretty well, I might add, with superb pitch control right to the last second).

  Interesting but totally irrelevant as the jet never got above 200ft.

  You're clearly implying a complete ballsup by the crew, making multiple serious mistakes or errors of omission.

  In the CSV data set that can be downloaded from that link the first point with altitude data is 1630 ft short of the departure threshold. That point is 575. The highest alt recorded in the data set is 625. All the points with altitude data overlay the departure runway. I do not understand how anyone is using this data set to determine the maximum altitude which was way past the departure end.

  Edit to add -  I have made no attempt to correct the raw ADS-B altitude data.   There is no need to make any correction to see altitude gain.

     Regarding the momentum: As the first few seconds of the climb were normal compared to previous T/Os of the same flight (speed &amp; altitude, confirmed by comparison of the RAW ADS-B data) I don't believe the engine failure happened before or on lift-off.

  FR24 did do that raw ADS-B data comparison. Remember the GPS position and barometric altitude are sent by the aircraft itself. The altitude is sent in 25 ft intervals, so a shallow curve that is smooth in reality looks janky in the data, due to the rounding of the numbers. From

     We&rsquo;ve taken data from AI171 departures for the month prior to the accident flight&mdash;including two previous operations by VT-ANB&mdash;and overlaid their departure paths on the data from AI171 on 12 June. The accident flight is in red, while all other flights are the blue paths. The data shown here is the uncalibrated barometric altitude, so the data is not above ground level, but it is consistent to itself.

  The red line is the accident flight, and it covers approximately 4.3 seconds.
  <br/>
  Obviously the altitudes are all uncorrected for barometric pressure, which would've varied with the weather on that day; you kind of have to mentally shift the lines vertically downward. Now I looked for, but couldn't find, the post in the old thread where the rotation was triangulated\xb9, but I remember that it was near the turnoff to the high-speed taxiway, so a few seconds ahead of this ADS-B capture. We only have the video to show us what occurred then.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That means the ADS-B data doesn't really tell us whether the first few seconds of the climb were normal or not.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When we compare the red line to the blue lines, the data tells us the climb rate had already decayed significantly before the accident aircraft passed over the end of the runway, because the red flight path is much more shallow than the blue flight paths.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Please correct me if I'm wrong: to my eye, the data alone does not show that the engines must have failed after rotation, because the data does not demonstrate a normal climb rate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But likewise, the engines can't have failed much before rotation:

     This aircraft has got airborne well within the requirements of FAR 25 under which it was certified. It has over 1250m ahead of it passing around 35' based on the video from behind, so the FMC data was not incorrect, the thrust up until after TO was not incorrect, and the CG is not out of range, the time to rotate is within expected range, and the attitude at liftoff is not excessive, the plane is not heavier than expected.
    </div>
   </div>

  For completeness' sake: you can look at the CCTV video, consider the 787's wingspan a flying 200 ft yardstick, and hopefully agree that the aircraft did not get much higher than 200 ft AAL, if that.

     You can triangulate the camera location using the aircraft holding short for takeoff and the road sign. Then draw a line from there just to the right of the instrumentation building and you'll find the aircraft rotated with about 4000 feet of runway remaining (11000+ runway length).

  There seems to be an assumption that, if corrected for local altimeter, the lines all move down toward the runway as a set.

  Wouldn't that only be true if the altimeter setting was the same on all the days those flights were made?  Isn't that improbable?

  I'd like to stick my neck out and say what I think I know. And I do mean "know", not what I think "likely" or "possible".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  1. The aircraft reached an altitude AGL rather more than one wingspan. This can be clearly seen in the still from the CCTV video posted by Cape Bloggs on 2025-06-18 at 0401. The 787-8 wingspan is 197+ ft. So it got at least 200 feet up in the air. (Info from CCTV screen shot.)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  2. (a) Ground effect on lift essentially disappears on TO when the wheels are at screen height. (Info from an eminent colleague who performed the analysis.) I believe it follows that (b) he didn't get up to 200 ft by performing a zoom climb on unstick. It further follows that (c) there must have been some initially adequate lift out of GE to establish for a few seconds positive RoC.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  3. The FR24 graphic posted by Musician shows that the aircraft became initially airborne "as usual", compared with other TO profiles. (Info from FR24.)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  4. The aircraft lacked adequate thrust even to maintain altitude shortly after unstick.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  5. Flaps 5 is minimal for TO. If you don't set it, you are told very clearly that you are misconfigured, well before TO roll. (Info from others.)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  6. At Flaps 5 and likely loading (fuel, PAX, token sum for baggage) and in the atmospheric conditions pertaining, there is more than enough nominal thrust available to establish positive RoC. That obviously also holds for Flaps-more-than-5. (Info from others.)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I am not
  <i>
   au fait
  </i>
  with audio spectral analysis so, unlike some others here, including some whose views and experience I value highly, I am agnostic at this point about the RAT. (This is neither to deprecate those who performed this analysis, nor the views of those who know more about practical spectral analysis than I do and are convinced by it.)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Now for my personal inference so far from this.
  <br/>
  Items 2 and 3 above suggest to me that the aircraft was adequately configured to conduct a normal TO and initially establish positive RoC for a second or two.
  <br/>
  For me, the big question is: why wasn't there adequate thrust to maintain that? (We've been talking about those possibilities for some days now - I won't attempt to summarise.)

  I am not convinced that the FR24 graphic shows that.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The FR24 data shows that, for the accident flight, the first data point received on takeoff was one that included altitude. We know where the aircraft was and we know the uncorrected baro altitude at that point.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  We do not know how the altitude of that first point compares to the altitude of the reference flights unless all flights have their altitude adjusted by the
  <u>
   prevailing
  </u>
  altimeter correction.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Each trace starts in about the same place over the runway but this may not be useful data. I don't think this is the ADS-B ground/air transition. I think it is the point at which reception of ADS-B data becomes possible because of transmission "line of sight". We don't know if data starts being received as a result of increased altitude or because of passing by whatever was blocking the signal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I'm sure someone could research the altimeter setting for each of the reference flight and produce a corrected data set. That would be interesting and useful data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That's just my interpretation of the data I have seen. It is not presented as fact.

  I have to agree with you
  <a href="https://www.pprune.org/members/20793-pbl" rel="nofollow">

  </a>
  . It is amazing that people are still arguing about the height the aircraft reached during the first 11s of the flight. It is almost measurable to the metre from the aircraft wingspan on the video. Do not mistake the power required to reach Vr within in the TORA with the power required to maintain a stable climb at V2 to V2+10 in the second and third segments. They are very different numbers, that's why Perf A is one of the dark arts of aviation!  It is quite probable that this aircraft rotated below a suitable Vr speed for the weight and ambient conditions and was unable to establish a stable climb due lack of applied power.  Big engines take time to spool up, your immediate future depends on how late you recognise the situation and go for TOGA.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But you ask..... How can an aircraft possibly get airborne with a stalled wing? Look at
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%A9gional_Flight_7775" target="_blank">
   Air France 7775
  </a>
  . At rotate the wing was already stalled (albeit for different reasons) but the airborne profile of the aircraft was rather similar to Air India.

  slf/ppl here - with a respectable amount of experience in software delivery for real-time/embedded/safety critical systems. Software development in this area really is an engineering discipline and bears no resemblance to common practice in other areas. Couple that with the requirements for function duplication/triplication, harness separation et al then IMHO the chances of FADEC etc software errors are effectively zero.

  I'm commenting to make that point but also to link the videos and the FR-24 dataset - (below with my deltas for height/time added)

  As noted in both threads to date everything was normal until it wasn't - the two values for fpm above are subject to FR24 variance of +/- 25' so even these suggest a normal climb at this stage of flight ca 2,000fpm. FR24 Lat/Longs all follow the centre line.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On this data the climb stops at around 70' AGL and electrical failure around 2s later. Again, as noted in the threads, this aligns with when gear up might have been expected. If the climb stopped because of fuel shutoff then 2s for spool down to electrical failure isn't out of the question.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Looking at the two videos.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CCTV video indicates a total flight time, from rotation, of about 32s, subjectively levelling off ~14s after rotation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rooftop video has a flight time ~14s suggesting the video starts ~18s after rotation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rooftop video evidences the RAT as deployed from the beginning - meaning it must have been deployed by at least 16s after rotation - which aligns with the ADS-B indicated electrical failure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If the forward flight recorder really is being sent to the US for recovery then it's reasonable to assume that the rear recorder contains nothing after the electrical failure and they are hoping the forward recorder captured something from the cockpit in the final 16s.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I don't have any experience of flight deck CRM but I don't see how those timings allow problem identification/misidentification and subsequent action - ie it wasn't down to the crew.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The maximum aircraft height in the CCTV video, as judged by wingspan, appears higher than 71' - though it is certainly less than a wingspan height at the beginning of the rooftop video.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I haven't seen, in the threads, any statement of what happens on the flight deck with a total electrical failure - is it a 4s blackout whilst the RAT deploys and systems restart? - or are there batteries that keep something alive?

  This incident is very perplexing to me. This is my first post on here and I am not a pilot. I have over a decade of experience in the RAAF as an engine fitter on Mirage and Hornet aircraft. Albeit a bit of time ago.
  <br/>
  I have watched the video's and looked at the FR-24 data a hundred times. To me it looks like a normal rotation and at WoW everything starts to go wrong.
  <br/>
  Airspeed starts dropping off immediately going by the FR-24 data. If reports are correct the pilot makes his Mayday call. FR-24 data stops.
  <br/>
  In the video from the balcony I agree the RAT is out and operating but I can also hear the engines at idle or just above (maybe flight idle).
  <br/>
  If the captain manually deployed the RAT this makes sense to me. In both video's I don't see any aircraft behavior that would suggest they are not flying the aircraft.
  <br/>
  Is there an electrical fault at WoW that renders the cockpit dark and therefore manually deploying the RAT (possibly initiating APU start, inlet door is open at crash site) would make sense to restore cockpit power.
  <br/>
  I can't understand any pilot shutting down both engines at 200ft AGL. He would surely know that his fight is over at that point.
  <br/>
  I am not ruling out pilot error (configuration or otherwise) but my hat goes off to two pilots that I believe were trying to fly this aircraft until it hit the ground.
  <br/>
  Sorry if my wording is a bit off but mine is military background not commercial.

  I'd agree, without expert knowledge there would have to be big assumptions, but I expect that Aircraft Flight Engineers could do it. Probably already have.

    The ADS-B datagrams sent by the aircraft show a much diminished climb rate with decaying speed, betraying insufficient thrust in that phase of the flight. That somewhat contradicts your assertions.

  Sure, actual data is usually more accurate than eyeballed stuff. But not always. In fact, it's often the eye that determines that something measured or calculated is "Off".

    I also do not have faith in anyone's ability to watch the cctv video and confidently determine through mere eyeballing that the climb rate did not decay by 15% within the first 100 feet or so.

  Sure, the CCTV footage I've seen is very poor, a video, moved about and zoomed, of the CCTV screen. Not easy to judge, but still useful and could be analysed frame-by-frame to compensate for all the extraneous input. Anyway, it's obvious to me that the rate of climb dropped abruptly just before the flight attained its apex, as if thrust was suddenly cut off. Knowing the momentum to altitude conversion, it might be possible to estimate whether that's true or not. The evident RAT deployment supports engine shutdown, not just engines to Idle, doesn't it? In that case, it would be useful to know at what altitude the engine shutdown took place.

  Just curious to get an idea of how much in this case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To be honest, i believe that taking a lot of the evidence into consideration, it is possible to arrive at a limited number of scenarios for what is most likely to have happened.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One fact that alters things substantially is whether the survivor's impression is correct that possibly the engines started to spool up again just before impact. If that's the case then what does that do to the possibility or otherwise that the TMCA system caused a dual engine shutdown?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To me, since the world seems to be watching this forum, and we are getting no feedback from the authorities, what is posted here might be useful in helping the investigators look at things they might not have considered. Besides, as Icarus2001 has kindof suggested, it's probably a very good thing that there are clearly lots of keen eyes on this.

  Right. ADS-B is transmitted via radio, so reception can be patchy, or obstructed by someone else transmitting on the same frequency (e.g. other aircraft), so not every datagram that the aircraft sends gets received. When that happens, the live display of FR24 assumes the aircraft kept doing what it did, and when another datagram eventually comes in, it corrects the position. It also connects the locations of these datagrams, regardless of whether the aircraft actually went there. For example, in the AI171 there's a 4-minute gap between a datagram sent on the taxiway, and the next datagram sent when the aircraft was off the ground towards the departure end of the taxiway. FR24 then connected these points via the shortest route; but we know that the aircraft actually used the intervening 4 minutes to taxi to the approach end of the runway, where it then started its take-off run. So that was false. (Another source of errors is when different FR24 receivers don't have synchronised clocks, so a mixture of data from these can have weird artifacts as a result.)
  <br/>
  However, the datagrams that FR24 actually received were correct. They contain the GPS position of AI171 and its unadjusted barometric altitude, as determined by its onboard instruments. This data is as reliable as the instruments themselves are. (An example here is that the NTSB wasn't sure that the altimeter on the Blackhawk that crashed at Washington-Reagan was accurate; if that is the case, the ADS-B data would also be affected.)

  It's uncertain because the 787 rounds all altitudes it sends to the nearest multiple of 25. The altitudes sent were from 575 ft to 625 ft., but that's MSL and not adjusted for the weather: low air pressure makes that number higher than the actual altitude. FR24 adjusted this to 21ft climbing to 71 ft, but it could've been 30 to 60 or maybe 10 to 80, as it's rounded. I think it's fairly close to 50 feet of climb, though.

  1) people taking the MSL altitude literally (625 ft)
  <br/>
  2) people adjusting for airport elevation (189 ft), but not for pressure: 437 ft
  <br/>
  3) people adjusting for pressure, some adjusting for temperature, get 71 to ~100 feet for the last recorded altitude.
  <br/>
  But while ADS-B reception was lost then (or the transmitter lost power), the aircraft continued climbing; examine the cctv video, knowing the wingspan is ~200 feet, we see that the aircraft reached 200 feet but not much more.

  The survivor likened the sound to a car engine revving up. If you've listened to a good version of the phone video, you'll have noticed the "vroom" sound at the start that some likened to a motorcycle. That sound is the RAT in action, and you can imagine what that would sound like when it rapidly spins up: like a driver stepping on the throttle with their car engine in neutral.

  The RAT deploying is a consequence of a dual engine shutdown. It says nothing about whether the TMCA was involved.

  Yes, got it, but wasn't what I was meaning to ask, sorry. My bad. I'm about over this TMCA stuff because it sounds like it's Trade Secret so a lot of guesswork, but the question I was intending was:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If the TMCA did activate and shut off the fuel for whatever reason, what causes the TMCA/FADEC Hardware (and Software) to Reset, since it's independently powered off the engine-driven PMG after engine start? There is so much here that is just so unclear. I haven't seen anything about a Reset input anywhere, and since it's supposed to work only when on the ground, that's not really necessary, as the engine will eventually spool down. At some point before that, the PMG output voltage will go to low enough that the FADEC/TMCA
  <b>

  be forced into a Hardware Reset. That's all fine on the ground, but in the air, the engine will windmill, potentially until.... Is the PMG output fed through a switch/relay that cuts the FADEC/TMCA supply at low (i.e. windmill) RPM, so that a Pilot-activated Engine Off/On cycle can reconnect the Aircraft FADEC Supply link, thus Rebooting the FADEC so that it reopens the Fuel Shutoff valve(s)?  It all seems so "awkward". And potentially fatal.  Is this a scenario that the designers considered? (Who can answer that one?

  )
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Just now, I realise that if this is roughly what happens, then maybe the engines did commence a restart just before impact, due to the plane being deliberately mushed/stalled to the ground as softly as possible, thereby reducing the windmill RPM. And maybe the engines restarting interfered with that planned landing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Or maybe I've got this all wrong. I'm hoping someone will tell us all.

  The figures being bandied around for the speed profile during the airborne segment of the TOD look a bit odd.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Firstly, because there isn't actually any speed data in the FlightRadar24 download (and even if there were, the aircraft doesn't send Airborne Velocity packets at the same time as Airborne Position ones). This is a longstanding issue with FR24, and it means that any graphic showing speed at a given position isn't necessarily 100% accurate:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <img alt="" class="post_inline_image" src="https://cimg1.ibsrv.net/gimg/pprune.org-vbulletin/303x291/fr24_speeds_5e4cbac527e5aa09423b91eb9509605727beadcf.png"/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Secondly, and assuming that FR24 has calculated GS as a second-order parameter, rather than a transmitted value, the instantaneous values still don't quite match the data in the download.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's easy to see that by correlating how far the aircraft has progressed against the data timestamps. Charting the remaining distance to the end of the runway against an arbitrary timescale starting from the first of the 8 data points looks like this:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <img alt="" class="post_inline_image" src="https://cimg3.ibsrv.net/gimg/pprune.org-vbulletin/1033x575/distance_graph_cropped_a094a8011b6c9fb16c2b300d75c833c05075b8d5.png"/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Obviously the slope/gradient of the blue line represents the average GS between successive points. The yellow reference line corresponds to a GS of 180 kts (ignore the offset, just use the slope for comparison).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yes, the aircraft had clearly slowed down after rotation, but the final two data points appear to show that it had stopped decelerating by the time the transponder stopped sending.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One wonders how FR24 arrived at its groundspeed values?
