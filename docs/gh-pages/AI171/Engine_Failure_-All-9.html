     No evidence of RAT deployment - but you're specifically restricting "the evidence" to a blurry amateur video. That alone is not great evidence, but why does that video exist at all? When they lift the relevant section of fuselage, RAT deployment or not is going to be fairly apparent. And Circumstantial evidence is still evidence, no?

  <br/>

  If the aircraft had flaps deployed (the crash site photos look like it), flight controls working (no indications they weren't), and the thrust levers pushed full forwards, there is very very little that will cause it to sink other than lack of thrust.

     Do not discount the mistaken early flap retraction scenario too easily. Mull on this:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     PF commanded gear up on attaining positive rate of climb, fixating on the HUD.
     <br/>
     PM mistakenly raise flap lever from 5 to Flap 1 gate. Thrust reduced to Climb Thrust. Landing gear remained deployed. Massive loss of lift misidentified as loss of thrust. If any one pilot just had a dual engine failure scenario on a recent sim ride, brain and muscle memory would jump to loss of thrust in dual engine, prompting them to accomplish the recall memory items which called for both engine fuel switches to OFF and then RUN, and physically deployed the RAT.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     There would be immediate loss of thrust with the engine taking time to recover , if at all, at such low airspeed!
     <br/>
     The rest is left for Ppruners&rsquo; imagination.ðŸ˜–ðŸ¥´ðŸ˜¬
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  If the photo of the flaps deployed at the accident site is actually F1 not F5 or if the flaps were pushed out during impact, then this is certainly plausible. I will look for the photo but it's in the thread somewhere. Others are stating they see a gap between the wing and the flap as an argument for the flaps deployed at F5. This was after the decent started..
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, I think their reaction would likely be to apply more power. I know mine would be. But anything is possible!

  Brilliant, now what is your point? Are you suggesting a double engine failure, a roll back to idle thrust or an incorrectly set AAI causing VNAV level off and a thrust reduction. You can only choose one.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the team pointing to the RAT out as a failure indicator, it could have been deployed by the crew after the initial reduction in climb performance. I am not convinced it is deployed but it really does not make a convincing argument for any type of failure.

  - Not true. No engine noise on video where you would expect TO or TOGA power to be in use. Mayday call stating No Power
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <i>
   No evidence of RAT deployment from a poor image
  </i>
  . - You can argue Not from the Image but...: 2 independent audio analysis of the video audio shows the sound comes from a deployed RAT plus JB's video. Plus the guys who live in SEA having heard 100's of RATs deployed during test flight have stated that the sound is a RAT.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <i>
   No evidence of electrical failure
  </i>
  . - Not true. Reported cabin emergency lights going off, FR24 feed stopped just as in the 737 South Korea incident in December. APU intake door partially open at crash scene, suggesting an APU autostart.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Now you can call into question the above evidence but to state there is none, is simply not true.

  Yes indeed. I strongly leant toward the incorrectly set AAI and VNAV capture and level off as the a/c reportedly reached max alt of 625ft or about 450ft AGL. Even with startle factor, recovery should have been quite possible. The video I have seen (not the video of the video) clearly shows the RAT deployed and you can hear the whine of the turbine and virtually no engine noise . This complicates it for me as there is no logical reason to deploy the RAT in the VNAV/level off scenario.

  In reply to you, I am solely stating that it's a thrust-side problem. I think I somewhat misinterpreted your post as it looks like you might have been saying that anyway.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In general, I think it's looking like dual engine failure/shutdown cutting electrics. I agree that
  <i>
   why
  </i>
  it occurred is very unclear. Outside chance of total electrical failure causing dual engine failure rather than the other way around, but that would perhaps be even more concerning a design failure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Similar to Jeju, we also have what is looking increasingly like a loss of ADS-B data at the moment things went wrong, not just a loss of coverage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That gives:
  <ul>
   <li>
    Sound of RAT
   </li>
   <li>
    Visible RAT
   </li>
   <li>
    (edit: APU door open implies APU autostart)
   </li>
   <li>
    Loss of ADS-B out
   </li>
   <li>
    Near-total loss of thrust.
   </li>
  </ul>
  The alternate theories seem to be a) flaps (basically discounted), b) suction feed failed after total electrical failure, or c):
  <ul>
   <li>
    A/T rolled engines back
   </li>
   <li>
    Crew interpreted this as dual engine failure
   </li>
   <li>
    Crew didn't push throttles forward
   </li>
   <li>
    Crew did switch each engine off &amp; on again and maybe deployed RAT manually as well.
   </li>
  </ul>

     Assuming GE receive data from these engines in flight, a massive failure would prompt a swift communication from GE. Or a massive electrical issue could put Boeing on edge and also prompt urgent inspections on their aircraft.

  (Sorry, Airbus here and not familiar with Boeing) Flap 5 to 1 reduction on the Boeing triggers autothrust reduction, is that correct? If so, are there any other conditions that need to be met for this to happen like being in some kind of takeoff mode? Just thinking whether this would have potential otherwise in other regimes to cause issues, discontinued approach perhaps.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Am slightly puzzled as to why if flap reduction triggering climb thrust is part of the standard logic (and presumably clean-up technique) then partial dual thrust loss wouldn\x92t be immediately recognised as the classic symptom of gear / flap retraction handling error? I presume Boeing pilots / air India are just as aware of this it as everyone else, strikes me as odd that one would immediately go into full dual EF mode. My instinctive reaction without knowing the Boeing would be to firewall both TLs, would this have worked in the early flap retraction logic scenario? Many thanks all

  So one thing to keep in mind, the RAT can be deployed manually, but also comes automatically when certain conditions arise, everybody here is assuming it\x92s only on dual engine failure but there are 4 more conditions that trigger the RAT,
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - all three hydraulic system pressures are low
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - loss of all electrical power to the captain and first officers flight instruments
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - loss of all four EMP\x92s (electro motor driven pump) and faults in the flight controls system occur during arrival
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - loss of all four EMP\x92s and an engine fails during take off.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This all comes directly from B787 FCOM,
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If we assume that what our survivor saw is correct, maybe it was an electrical failure, the aircraft had electrical issues in Delhi during departure and I checked the crash video again, I don\x92t see the strobe lights (neither wing or tail) and also no Anti collision light either. this might also explain the self starting APU on loss of the electrics (engine driven generators). That could also result in a loss of situational awareness with the speed, because of no indication, even the HUD would not work. The mayday call would still be doable because the radios work from the battery.

  I saw earlier someone post about this and wondered how the drill would run and how/who performed memory items. On a past 4 jet type a double engine failure drill was done in the sim regularly and both had immediate actions as well as a number of confirmations but at least we still had two runningðŸ˜Ž. In this scenario of a twin jet where perhaps the PF noticed a major loss of thrust and called \x93Double engine failure drill\x94 would PNF confirm it then do the 2 switches and hit the guarded RAT button without identification and confirmation or is it whoever gets there first? Seems a free for all scramble would be a poor way to do it since latched and guarded switches could be operated incorrectly in a panic without deliberate and controlled movement backed up by confirmation of diagnosis and then the memory items?

  Define facts! Reported by an eyewitness, reported by Indian media? The ' mayday that they lost power.' is not a fact but invented by a journalist. The " aircraft used the whole runway" is not officially reported by the investigators but noted by an Indian newspaper. In the same article of today this newspaper wrote about the fake mayday call.

  Well I&rsquo;m a triple driver so can&rsquo;t be sure for the 78, but during the preflight we can programme thrust reduction either at and altitude or at flap 5 or 1. The company I&rsquo;m with at the moment it&rsquo;s an altitude, the one I was at before was usually at a flap setting. I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s got anything to do with this accident though. I guess you could enter 150ft instead of 1500ft in the FMC for the thrust reduction which would be alarming when it happened for sure but doesn&rsquo;t explain the RAT or the gear observations&hellip;.. unless someone did something like the memory items in response to what they perceived to be a double engine failure, but at that altitude, with no confirmation of any failure? I wouldn&rsquo;t have thought so but never say never.

     The issue is what maintenance error could cause simultaneous dual engine failure, or other hypothesized causes? But would not result in an immediate alarm (e.g. missing FADEC alternator) on engine startup/high-thrust?"

  That would require deep dive in the maintenance records of that bird, and it's ludicrous to think we'll be able to figure it out. To cause dual engine failure at "gear up" callout (everybody's nightmare, unrecoverable) - that needs to be either drastic, super weird, or malevolent. And that hole goes too deep for us to guess.

  In less than a month we'll have a preliminary report.

     The Mayday specified loss of control and engine failure.

  This has been reported but not naming any verified or even specified source. I have also recently read in this thread at least 2 different versions, the most recent one before yours, upthread, being even more specific than the one that went around at first. Despite what is being quoted by yourself and others, with no verified source, the Indian Aviation minister reported at the most recent press conference that the mayday message was as follows :- "mayday, mayday". ATC replied asking for further info, but got no reply. Despite a lot of searching online, that is ALL that is currently verified, so far, re the mayday call.

  I cannot get my head around any of the likely scenarios as there seems to be a lot to go wrong to get to the end result. One of the things that has confused is that it looks like they go off the end of the runway. ie no more runway left and the look of soil being blown up into the air.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I kept looking at that video where it disappears behind the shed and I could be seeing things but as it rotates it "looks" like it starts to yaw left and change direction. I have spent a fair few years as a TRE and I have seen plenty of times in the sim where insufficient rudder after an engine failure will lead to a slightly undignified slide over the side of the runway after they get airborne. I wonder if that dust is actually from the side of the runway rather than the argued end of the runway. I temper that thought with the fact of the change of zoom might create that illusion.

     It could do it, assuming fuses/contactors didn't vapourise first.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I expect the VFSG shafts would be designed to fuse/slip long before the main radial shaft feeding the gearbox, as noted.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     But if it occurred, it would knock out not just your FADEC alternator but also the high pressure fuel pumps. Engine would stop dead near instantly.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     It would partly be a question of how much interlocking is present. I guess bypassing/mis-adjusting mechanical interlocks is something poor maintenance could &amp; would do.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I have been really wondering what single point of failure could take out both engines simultaneously as seems to be the case here. One single main bus contactor closing in error seems to possibly be such a single point fault.
  <br/>
  Online/running generators connected together by accident/fault will cause a HUGE load on everything, electric connections, generator itself and the shafts and gears driving the generators. Heck, I wouldnt be surprised if the generator could disintegrate due to such an electromagnetic shock load.
  <br/>
  So, the question is if there is something between the generators that could limit the electric current. A VFD possibly would as the VFD maybe would not be able to pass the current required for shearing the drive shaft for example. But then again, electronic switches like IGBT/MOSFET and such are able to pass an incredibly large over current for some milliseconds before exploding. Possibly 50 to 100 times the nominal current. So I am not sure if a VFD really would save the rest of the system in a situation with two generators connected together in error.
  <br/>
  So, where is the VFD part installed, directly on each generator or somewhere else in the system? Are there physical interlocks on the contactors or only electric interlocks?

     A TCMA bug just doesn't bear thinking about, I really hope that doesn't turn out to be the case.

  What if the PF called stop just before V1and closed the thrust levers but either changed his mind or was overridden by the other pilot, who rapidly pushed the thrust levers back up. Could this trigger a TCMA intervention and subsequent dual engine shutdown as it was still on the runway at this point? Hopefully not.

      What if the PF called stop just before V1 and closed the thrust levers but either changed his mind or was overridden by the other pilot, who rapidly pushed the thrust levers back up. Could this trigger a TCMA intervention and subsequent dual engine shutdown as it was still on the runway at this point? Hopefully not.

  This is the best theory of TCMA activation so far, but it\x92s still very remote. In this theory there is no need for a TCMA anomaly, it needs only(!) two simultaneous engine anonalies (and sn improper crew action) that would trigger the TCMA as designed. If there are safeguards preventing this happening, they are not mentioned in this thread.

  It also doesn\x92t explaine the ADS-B data showing acceleration after lift off.
