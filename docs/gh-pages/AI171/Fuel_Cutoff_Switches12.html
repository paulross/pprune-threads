  The Fuel Cut Off switches on a 787 have to be pulled up (out of \x91run\x92) and whilst held up, they are then moved backwards to the  \x91cut off\x92 position. They are designed this way so loose objects

     I doubt you\x92d have got such immediate positive intervention from most line crews faced with the same circumstances and time

   </div>
  </div>
  I think most line pilots, upon noticing that the fuel levers were in cutoff right after rotation, would immediately turn them back on.  I don't think it would take 10 seconds--or even 5--to get that handled as I imagine most professional pilots would quickly grasp the seriousness of the problem.  The only explanation I can think of for even that short delay--one that may have made a big difference--is the authority gradient between Captain and FO.  But the preliminary report doesn't give us the level of detail we'd all like to have so it probably isn't possible to 100% support any specific conclusion just yet.

  It confirms that both fuel cutoff switches were moved to OFF at Vr, within a one second interval which is as extreme and inexplicable as it gets.

  Actually, why are switches that are only really required on the ground or in an engine shut down event where they are? Embraer's have the switches out of the way on an overhead panel and as well as detent locked, have a protective guard, one has to physically lift. If the PF had to physically carry out the engine shut down on an Embraer, he would have to raise his arm. Would be obvious to the PnF.

     So, yes, switches.
     <br/>
     either
     <br/>
     1/deliberately cut off by someone in the cockpit, or
     <br/>
     2/placed in an intermediate gate position possible due to wear or wrong installation, happens during engine start, and then vibrates or bumps to cut-off during the take off roll or
     <br/>
     3/some kind of liquid or other contamination in the LRU shorting both and cycling them after 8 seconds brought them electrically back to RUN.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Anyone got other ideas?
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  In the case of (2) or (3), would the expected response be "Why did you cutoff"?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I would have thought a pilot would notice the engines spooling down, and comment on that. To immediately jump to the cutoff switches as the cause rather implies something drew attention to the switches.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Then there is a 10+ second gap before the switches are set to run again. I can't think of any good reason why the PNF would have taken so long to correct an accidental or deliberate manipulation of the switches.

     One item in the report is the position of the LG Lever - Down.
     <br/>
     Given the lack of a full transcript, and in trying to defend the crewmembers
     <i>
      intentions
     </i>
     , Is it possible that at the point of "Positive Rate - Gear Up" - PM Brain farted, and performed a different muscle memory action? Thus they would deny moving the Switches - and take a few seconds to compute what they just did?
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  The landing gear lever is forward and up on the centre instrument panel, adjacent to the PFD. The two fuel control switches are aft and low, on the thrust pedestal. There's no reasonable way to confuse one for the other in terms of position, hand movement or 'muscle memory'.

  It can only know their electrical, not mechanical positions. Think about it, how would that work?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Would love to see some kind of accelerometer reading of the moment the switches went to cut off. Or even cockpit area audio.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They will figure it out.

  Neither pilot was likely speaking in order to be recorded for posterity, so that 'conversation' makes perfect sense in a situation where there is high stress and a great deal of confusion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As to the report not closing off speculation, that isn't it's purpose. It is there to report the facts as they are found. It must also be said that speculation is not in any place but the eye of the beholder.

  No there is not. Further investigation will likely see if the locking detents were in a decent state or not. TBQH, such a switch should be properly guarded. Like a Embraer is, like other types that one sees with switches one has to lift a guard to operate and is locked on with the guard in position. Boeing designers found out again in not making processes fool proof?

     Actually, why are switches that are only really required on the ground or in an engine shut down event where they are? Embraer's have the switches out of the way on an overhead panel and as well as detent locked, have a protective guard, one has to physically lift. If the PF had to physically carry out the engine shut down on an Embraer, he would have to raise his arm. Would be obvious to the PnF.

  I raised this on one of the other threads, they are supposed to be isolated systems, and I am sure they are according to electromechanical tradition, but for both human factors and electromechanical reasons, should\x92nt they be off to each side of the cockpit to be considered isolated?

     The landing gear lever is forward and up on the centre instrument panel, adjacent to the PFD. The two fuel control switches are aft and low, on the thrust pedestal. There's no reasonable way to confuse one for the other in terms of position, hand movement or 'muscle memory'.

  Understood - Absolutely no way of 'confusing' the two very different items in very different places. I'm suggesting more of a 'why did I just put my car keys in the fridge? issue.

     In the case of (2) or (3), would the expected response be "Why did you cutoff"?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I would have thought a pilot would notice the engines spooling down, and comment on that. To immediately jump to the cutoff switches as the cause rather implies something drew attention to the switches.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Then there is a 10+ second gap before the switches are set to run again. I can't think of any good reason why the PNF would have taken so long to correct an accidental or deliberate manipulation of the switches.

   </div>
  </div>
  Exactly right.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  You need to take the audio together with the switch data, not in isolation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two combined would appear to rule out a lot of options that the data alone would leave possible.

  Out of interest, hypothetically if the captain was an instructor, is there a possibility that any kind of muscle memory from simulated failures in the simulator may have been triggered?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Let\x92s say that you are having to retrain another pilot on v1 cut handling whilst you occupy the P1 seat. Temptation may be to use the fuel cut off switches to save time rather than going back to the sim operator panel to reprogram the failure.

     Would love to see some kind of accelerometer reading of the moment the switches went to cut off. Or even cockpit area audio.

  The report mentions that the immediate prior flight crew had written up a "STAB POS XDCR" status message, and that troubleshooting was carried out.
  <br/>
  Is it possible that the troubleshooting/diagnostics left the stab cutout switches on the pedestal in the cutoff position, which went unnoticed until liftoff (i.e. upon noticing that the trim wasn't operable), resulting in a reach towards those switches, which are situated right next to the engine cutoff switches?

  I know it's not a popular opinion around here but it seems like a flight deck camera would be quite useful right about now to determine whether either pilot's hands strayed near the fuel cutoff switches at the recorded time.

    As per the EAFR, the Engine 1 fuel cutoff switch transitioned from CUTOFF to RUN at about
   </i>
   <i>
    08:08:52 UTC. The APU Inlet Door began opening at about 08:08:54 UTC, consistent with the APU Auto Start logic. Thereafter at 08:08:56 UTC the Engine 2 fuel cutoff switch also transitions from CUTOFF to RUN. When fuel control switches are moved from CUTOFF to RUN while the aircraft is inflight, each engines full authority dual engine control (FADEC) automatically manages a relight and thrust recovery sequence of ignition and fuel introduction. The EGT was observed to be rising for both engines indicating relight.
    <b>
     Engine 1's core deceleration stopped, reversed and started to progress to recovery.
    </b>
    Engine 2 was able to relight but could not arrest core speed deceleration and re-introduced fuel repeatedly to increase core speed acceleration and recovery. The EAFR recording stopped at 08:09:11 UTC.
   </i>
   <br/>
  </div>
  That was with 10 seconds delay vs. 13 seconds for engine 2.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Time was spent with the verbal exchange, and then perhaps each pilot expected the other to put the switch back?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anyway, the preliminary report also establishes that the aircraft had only 3-4 seconds of powered flight. (Would the gear lever be operated that early?) Everyone who saw that from the CCTV video, pat yourselves on the back.

  <br/>
  Mayday call, dual engine failure, RAT deployment all confirmed.
  <br/>
  TCMA was a red herring, the aircraft was firmly in air mode as the accident unfolded, and the thrust levers were at takeoff thrust the whole time.
