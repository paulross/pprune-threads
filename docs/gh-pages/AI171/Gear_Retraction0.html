  Exactly what I was thinking, landing gear still down at a height it would normally be retracted and the wing clean before normal acceleration altitude suggests just that. F/O with 1100 hours total time might make a mistake like that, although no one is immune.

  And PF's reaction being to pull back and stall into the ground rather than lower the nose, select TOGA and call for gear up (or do it himself)....

  Like most Boeings, on the 787 you are prevented from selecting the flaps/slats all the way up in one go by the gate at flap 1.  If this was a mis-selection by one of the pilots, they would have been prevented from selecting ALL the high lift devices up in one go by the flap 1 gate.  Even if you manage to get the lever to the Flaps Up position then below 225kts you should get Slat-Gap protection which maintains MOST of the lift.  I have never tried it personally but that's the operation as advertised by Boeing.  Would that provide enough lift to save them...... that is really a matter of debate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The aircraft may have suffered a power loss of one or both engines possibly by bird strike. I have to say that the B787 is the very easiest aircraft I have ever flown when handling an engine failure above V1. The flight path vector and the flight director in the head up display make finessing an engine failure absolute child's play.  Having said that the Boeing 787 performance is calculated right to the limits of legal requirement, so there is no scope for mis-handling.  If they failed to select the landing gear up, not due to a flap lever mis-selection, but some another distraction, like an engine failure, then the aircraft would struggle to accelerate to V2 to safely climb away.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The B787 derates are calculated to give an acceptable Vmca in the event of an engine failure.  That is to say, if you apply any more power asymmetricly the Vmca criteria of up to 5deg of bank towards the live engine will require more control input resulting in more control drag.  Our SOP was - If you need it - Use It!  Thankfully I never had to find out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By way of illustration, on the B747-400, leaving the gear down following an engine failure had the same effect as failing two of the four engines.

  Ok, nobody mentioned this or at least I can't see this.  If the brakes are very hot due to use during taxying the landing gear is often left down longer than usual to cool the brakes to a safe temperature before retraction (see Swissair 306) It was also very hot on the ground today

  Not a big or busy airport. Taxi time would've been minimal. Aircraft was on the ground for around 2 hours from the previous flight which is enough in most cases. It's every so slightly possible though.

  Extremely unlikely imho.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If pre-planned, it would apply a serious (commercially costly) weight penalty on take off. If not pre-planned it would invalidate all the normal take-off performance figures. I have no idea what the cause of this tragic accident is but I am sure the investigators will be at least considering the gear and flap positions and associated selections.

     Just for the record, there is no system on modern Boeing aircraft to prevent the accidental retraction of flaps when too low or slow when airborne. You wouldn't even get a warning on Boeing aircraft that is related to Flaps, you'd eventually get one related to Low Speed or Stall. The Airbus has a safety feature called "Alpha-Lock" which physically stops the Flaps from moving when the AoA or speed? is deemed too low. But that's not a safety net for all flap settings, just the lowest for takeoff. It will save the day in 95% of situations though Mr Boeing (hint hint)
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Takeoff config warnings and checklists may not have helped if the flap setting was not enough given the weight and conditions. A good handling pilot could recover from an incorrect flap setting (providing there's no obstacles to deal with), by gently lowering the nose allowing the airspeed to build up before resuming the climb. However, various human factors such as startle and over reliance on automation (my thrust setting must be good) will not help the situation.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     In order of likelihood:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     1.) Flaps moved instead of gear
     <br/>
     2.) Incorrect Flap settings and inability of crew to recover from that
     <br/>
     3.) Double engine failure
     <br/>
     4.) Some electrical event that distracted them
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Item 1) On the 787, is the gear lever on the main panel facing the flight crew, or on the centre console? I'd imagine they'd (flap and gear levers) need to be adjacent to each other for that to happen. All good points though.

  Main panel. And the handle is a rubber wheel. The flap lever is shaped like a flap. But that hasn\x92t stopped it happening multiple times in the past. The yellow and red lines on the speed tape will start to converge and should be an indication to PF. On all Boeing / Airbus that\x92s it\x92s happened on the pilots have recovered by re selcting flaps. Selecting F1 will save you. It\x92s a Boeing procedure written in the manual.

  doesn't have to be hot brakes, there are a number of 787 MELs which require gear down after takeoff, the most extreme I ever applied got us to FL150 before we could retract it.
  <br/>
  very doubtful this would be the cause of this accident however

  A mayday call will normally contain information about the nature of the emergency.
  <br/>
  The flaps instead of gear is based on the landing gear being down throughout the whole emergency. It\x92s just weird. I get that it may be overlooked in a stressful situation, but when they had time for a mayday call?

  So, someone said the 747 will have an early thrust reduction if you retract flaps too early, is this also the case with the 787?

     No idea what happens to a Dreamliner, but the A320 series can handle flaps instead of gear retraction

     Deep breath... I wasn't convinced before, I am now. The RAT is definitely out guys. We are now potentially looking at a problem with the aircraft. Possibly a big one!

  something I\x92m not sure has been discussed till now- doesn\x92t the 787 have an \x91early door\x92 function where the gear doors automatically open to improve performance? Even pprune has discussed this:

  in the video/images seen it doesn\x92t appear that the gear doors are down, does this further indicate an AC power loss?

     A mayday call will normally contain information about the nature of the emergency.
     <br/>
     The flaps instead of gear is based on the landing gear being down throughout the whole emergency. It\x92s just weird. I get that it may be overlooked in a stressful situation, but when they had time for a mayday call?

  This was my thought.  tf were they doing making a radio call in that situation.

     The theories concerning inadvertent flap retraction are not consistent with the apparent transcript from the mayday call made or rat deployment. In the first video that circulated, the engines can\x92t really be heard (certainly not producing any significant amount of thrust). If the aircraft was climbing out misconfigured, those engines would be screaming. Instead, all you can hear is the rat.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Similarly - a bird strike, knocking out two engines simultaneously is a noisy/messy event and I would expect to see evidence of this occurring in both videos, and in the area at the point of ingestion. The engines don\x92t just roll back with a bird strike - they surge, smoke, bang and splutter. It would be very apparent.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     At this time, I think everything is pointing towards both engines simultaneously having their fuel feeds interrupted between V1 and Vr. CVR/FDR will be interesting.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  The issue I have with the \x91mis-selected flaps up\x92 theory is that if PM had accidentally retracted flaps, I\x92d expect the PF to lower the nose, apply max thrust to try and accelerate by flying level or in a minimal descent. In this accident, the nose never seems to get lowered to decrease the AoA, in fact pitch increases just before it seems to stall. I\x92d also expect similar for an overweight takeoff, thrust or loadsheet error.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fact none of the above happened, coupled with the lack of landing gear coming up, makes me think they didn\x92t have thrust to play with.

  Just to say that I have always seen BA fly the 787 at approx. circuit height at LHR with landing gear always down. It is not raised until later into the departure. It does look really strange but I assume is part of the 787-specific SOP's, perhaps someone could confirm........
