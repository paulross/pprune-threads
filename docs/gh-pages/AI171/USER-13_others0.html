     This is one of the reasons for the valid
     <i>
      theoretical

     points about probabilities not necessarily being valid as a matter of practicality. It's entirely reasonable to argue that, for example, the probabilities of a weight on wheels sensor failing at the same time as a throttle position sensor are vanishingly remote. But try predicting what will happen if a cup of coffee is spilt over a control console, or a piece of loose swarf in a connector shorts unrelated system wires or...

     The scenarios are nearly infinite and it is impossible to predict the consequences of all of them.

     The statistics that apply to such a situation are Bayesian statistics.

   </div>

  Baysian statistics play no role here, for the reason Lead Balloon identified: there are too many variables at play. Worse,
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox" target="_blank">
   Simpson's paradox
  </a>
  identifies that, even in the circumstance where you
  <i>
   know
  </i>
  the
  <i>

  </i>
  variables at play, you've still got to think clearly through what is going on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  You did stipulate that more causality factors can be calculated using Baysian means, but so what? Back to LB's first point: calculating all of them is not practical.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While the general public (i.e. The Simpsons) can be impressed with statements like "A billion flight hours without a mishap" what matters is the precise combination of factors that caused the earlier mishap, and how similar current circumstances are to that mishap. Viewed with such insight, mishaps are almost ordinarily common (aviation example being 178 seconds to live for a VFR pilot going VMC into IMC).

     What if it takes something to be worn/used after many years to get that kind of failure? The AI 787 was 11 years old. We have been discussing the fuel switches, but there are thousands of other parts that might contribute to such a failure in connection with some other problem.

  Before this accident occurred, Boeing whistleblowers were in fact reporting that planes were leaving the line, entering service with defects (including swarf) that would cause accidents many years later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The TWA 800 airframe was 25 years old at the time of the accident, where arced wiring was implicated in that crash. In the aftermath, industry-wide sampling of aircraft found cracked insulation on wiring, non-factory swarf added by follow-on maintenance, instances where wiring had been re-routed or manipulated in a manner that placed increased strain on looms, etc. Of course the problem with wiring-related problems is that they can produce faults that no engineer could have foreseen or have developed countermeasures for.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Not to be an alarmist, but much has been written about wiring issues on the aging fleet. I tend to believe that maintenance people in earlier generations were more conscientious about their work, where now more than ever corners are cut (beginning at the factory).

  Perhaps a result of being too dense, in these threads I have not understood whatsoever the discussions on L/D, best glide, AOA, stall speed, angles, whatever, as being relevant to this flight. I assume that the pilot flying was flying, i.e. stick and rudder. I give him/her the benefit of the doubt on account of being a pilot. Professional or not.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the accident observed, the lessons learned in a Piper Cub, or lessor, apply. If you sense that you're going to smack the ground, then by God smack the ground with that part of you best engineered to take the relevant forces involved. Even pigeons understand this. This is a function of intuition. It's pointless to waste ink/electrons on the subject. In simple terms, the bottom-side of the aircraft most compressible without tender flesh involved is where a pilot should be expected to pitch to. These pilots, from a far away perspective, did it right. Proof being that someone walked away.

     Background
     <br>
      The Boeing Company (Boeing) received reports from operators of Model 737 airplanes that the fuel control switches were installed with the locking feature disengaged. The fuel control switches (or engine start switches) are installed on the control stand in the flight deck and used by the pilot to supply or cutoff fuel to the engines. The fuel control switch has a locking feature to prevent inadvertent operation that could result in unintended switch movement between the fuel supply and fuel cutoff positions.
      <b>
       In order to move the switch from one position to the other under the condition where the locking feature is engaged, it is necessary for the pilot to lift the switch up while transitioning the switch position. If the locking feature is disengaged, the switch can be moved between the two positions without lifting the switch during transition, and the switch would be exposed to the potential of inadvertent operation.
      </b>
      Inadvertent operation of the switch could result in an unintended consequence, such as an in-flight engine shutdown.
      <br>
       <br>
        ...The table below identifies the affected airplane models and related part numbers (P/Ns) of the fuel control switch, which is manufactured by Honeywell.

     I'm bewildered by the descriptions of the toggle switches. 'Lifting' is not the terminology I've lived with. The knob is pulled out so that the detents in the inner end of the knob can move over the sharp ridges on the switch body. A minor point, but what is not so minor is the inference that these detents and ridges are a safety design that is sometimes not installed. Surely, they must be talking about some further mechanism, or am I in the twilight zone? I cannot believe there's an aircraft with simple smooth action between off and on, an over-centre toggle . . . that will stop the engines!
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  The Service Bulletin (link below) referenced on page 6 of the preliminary report describes just that...fuel control switches without detents or what the bulletin describes as a "locking feature" that can be "disengaged" and still allow the switch to function. It's somewhat of a glaring omission that the report did not state the status (detent or not) of the switches on this aircraft. Presumably if no-detent switches were found then an emergency AD would already have been issued.

     ...The report mentions that the flight crew on the immediately prior flight had written up a "STAB POS XDCR" status message, and that troubleshooting was carried out. I wonder if the scenario could be that the accident crew received a Stabiliser EICAS message on or around take-off and the Capt (who was PM) decided to action the first checklist item immediately from memory, by intending to move the Stab switches to Cutoff but moving the fuel switches instead...

     I assume the 10 second pause is based on how long it took the two 787 event pilots to realize their error and return the switches to RUN.

  I assume the unusual alarm cacophony that erupted after cutting the engines would have been overwhelming. Agree an error in good faith. If bad faith were involved, the switches wouldn't have returned to the run position, or at least they wouldn't have been allowed to remain there.

     I just looked at a picture of the 787 throttle area and I don't see how one would ever confuse the stabilizer cutout switches with the engine fuel cutoff switches. They are completely different in look and feel and operation........Also, what is the supposed startling event here?

  Um, the flap and gear levers are a totally different design and they look, feel, operate differently. They are not even co-located, and occasionally people confuse them, withstanding decades of design efforts.

  The fact that EICAS messages were recorded does not mean that they were provided in the preliminary report.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The notion is that around liftoff EICAS reported an error related to an error logged on the previous flight, that the PM felt it prudent to remedy the problem by cutting the stab cutoff switches, inadvertently cutting fuel. Action-slip, as mentioned countless times in these threads.
