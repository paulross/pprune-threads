     It does not follow that MCAS malfunction is a software malfunction.
     <br/>
     As far as I know, the software functioned exactly as it was specified/required to function. The problem did not lie in the quality of the software, as you suggest. It lay in the functional requirements for the function, and the hazard analysis of those requirements, and those are manufacturer tasks.
    </div>
   </div>

  I thought this was a very good point. There are some detailed posts discussing the TCMA patent
  <a href="https://www.pprune.org/accidents-close-calls/666581-air-india-ahmedabad-accident-12th-june-2025-part-2-a-6.html#post11903859" target="_blank">
   including this post
  </a>
  . Is it possible the TCMA software functioned exactly as specified, and the issue is input data into TCMA?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a total electrical failure, when the system switches to emergency battery power, how are input variables like rad alt and wow switches processed? (these were inputs someone mentioned on the 747-8, have the TCMA inputs been identified yet?)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I speculate the gear truck forward tilt is a symptom of a C hydraulic failure caused by a total electrical failure around the time of VR. Once they got 10 deg nose up on the rotation, with a total electrical failure, could the FADEC receive erroneous rad alt or wow inputs, and how would TCMA handle these inputs in the transition from ground to air logic?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  What is baffling is the simultaneous nature of the suspected dual engine shutdown. There is no obvious asymmetry, with the flight path or rudder movements. If the engine fuel control switches had been manually cut one at a time, there should have been some visible flightpath change or flight control response. Something happened to both engines at exactly the same time.

   DISCLAIMER: Poster (a) is one of the (apparently quite numerous) lawyers following this thread; (b) a long-time forum lurker and aviation enthusiast who loves studying FCOMs for fun (to each his own, I guess); (c) has followed and read this thread from the start.

  <br/>
  <br/>
  What I cannot do is add new theories or uncover any new facts the actual experts have not already thought of. However, since summarizing and structuring information is one thing lawyers tend to regularly do (and sometimes even do well), here is my attempt at a useful contribution to this thread: an attempt to summarize the main theories discussed here since day one (which I think hasn't been done for quite some time) in the hope that a birds-eye view will be helpful to those who have not read everything since the beginning or might even trigger some new flash of inspiration for someone more knowledgable than me. I have focused on the cons since there does not seem to be enough evidence to come to any positive conclusion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I shall try to be concise and to refrain from personal evaluations of my own. Of course, no disrespect whatsoever is intended towards all those who have contributed to this thread and to the individual theories, one or combinations of which may turn out to have led to this tragic outcome. That arguments can be made against every single theory that has been propagated seems to be the result of the highly improbable and unusual nature of this deplorable event and certainly not due to any lack of knowledge or reasoning skills in this forum.

  Anyway, here goes:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <b>
   <u>
    <span style="color:black">
     A. Misconfiguration or wrong takeoff data
    </span>
   </u>
  </b>
  <br/>
  <span style="color:black">
   Widely refuted, since
  </span>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <span style="color:black">
     rotation, takeoff and initial climb seem normal;
    </span>
   </li>
   <li>
    likely extreme errors would have been required to have such tragic effect (the fuel tanks should have been only about half full, so not close to MTOW);
   </li>
   <li>
    there is strong evidence that at least some flaps were extended for takeoff (post-crash photo, perhaps also visible in video from behind)
   </li>
  </ul>
  <b>
   <u>
    <span style="color:black">
     B. Flaps retracted post-takeoff instead of gear
    </span>
   </u>
  </b>
  <br/>
  <span style="color:black">
   Still brought up from time to time. However, widely disregarded due to
  </span>
  <ul>
   <li>
    the fact that with two working engines an inadvertent flap retraction should easily be recoverable, even with gear down;
   </li>
   <li>
    strong indications that hydraulic and electric power were lost (audible/visible indications of RAT extension, survivor statement, lack of engine noise, position of MLG bogies).
   </li>
  </ul>
  <span style="color:black">
   For a while, the forward tilt of the bogies as first part of the retraction cycle was seen as additional evidence that the gear had been selected up. However, it has been pointed out that the forward tilt and the opening of the gear doors occur almost simultaneously so that it seems unlikely that hydraulic power was lost in the split second between bogie tilt and gear door actuation. It is now assumed the forward tilt of the bogies was merely a consequence of the hydraulic power loss.
  </span>
  <br/>
  <span style="color:black">
   It should be pointed out that the question of "RAT in or out" was for a while the most contentious in this thread.

     C. Low-altitude capture

  <span style="color:black">
   Still argued, even if refuted by many since
  </span>
  <ul>
   <li>
    inconsistent with apparent loss of hydraulic/electric power;
   </li>
   <li>
    PF would have been flying manually (however, A/T reaction would have been unexpected for the PF);
   </li>
   <li>
    should have been recoverable (unless one assumes that the crew (a) remained unaware of the changed FMA annunciations although alerted by the unexpected FD commands; and (b) was so startled that an A/T thrust reduction was not noticed and corrected, even though the PF was apparently sufficiently alert not to follow the FD commands).

  Great summary. I've already mentioned the first below, but I'd add another:
  <ul>
   <li>
    The existence (and timing) of the flyby video by a young lad who apparently lived where the footage was shot from. With planes flying past every few minutes, why would he choose to film this one, before he could even see it? The video starts with the plane still approaching, out of view, and his position suggests it was unplanned, before he could move to a better vantage point. I say he already knew it was extraordinary - from the sound.
   </li>
   <li>
    Eye witness account from the mother of the lad who filmed the flyby, apparently said that the plane was "shaking". I'll assume she didn't know how to describe it properly, and that maybe it sounded like it was shaking, from hearing the noise from the RAT.  Or it's a translation issue of a word/s with multiple meanings or used colloquially.
   </li>
  </ul>
  One question - are there two exterior doors to the APU compartment, one on top, one below, presumably inlet and outlet of cooling airflow? I've seen photos showing two open doors, but the lower one could be something else, and busted open during the crash.

     Just out of interest as the aircraft rotates and gets airborne won&rsquo;t the twin main biggest not already be in a noe down attitude and the first stage of raising the gear just ensures it&rsquo;s there and locked before retraction?
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  The 787-8 gear goes through the following movements on TO:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  1. During rotation all 4 main wheels on each gear truck stay on the runway, the gear acts as a pivot point for the rotation. Effectively the gear truck is in a forward tilt as it is no longer parallel to the fuselage.
  <br/>
  2.
  <strike>
   Once
  </strike>
  As the wheels lift off the runway, the trucks tilt rearward (this is the normal extended gear in air position, like on approach)
  <br/>
  3. When the pilot commands gear up, the gear retraction sequence begins, specific to the 787-8, the gear trucks tilt forwards first, instantly followed by the gear doors opening.

   See this post

  which discusses the forward tilt is either caused by process (1) or process (3). I suggest (1) is more likely than (3).

  I might have missed the thing, but as the gear up sequence did start we can be quite sure that the WoW logic had the aircraft \x94in air\x94 (not on ground).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This probably makes the theory of the TCMA halt a little? Gear up would be inhibited from not being in air.

     Therefore we cannot determine wow or air/ground logic from an assumed gear retraction.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Further to the (logical in my view) points you make in response to AAKEE's ostensibly logical conclusion that the commencement of undercarriage retraction (if it did commence) is conclusive of the aircraft being 'in the air' for aircraft systems purposes, including TCMA purposes, I make the following points:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  First, whilst it may be that every system that monitors and makes decisions about whether the aircraft is 'in the air' does so on the basis of exactly the same sensor inputs, that may not be true and I'd appreciate someone with the expert knowledge on the 78 to confirm or refute the correctness of the assumption, particularly in relation to, for example, FADEC functions compared with undercarriage control functions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Secondly and probably more importantly, what happens if one of the sensors being used to determine 'in air' versus 'on ground' gives an erroneous 'on ground' signal
  <i>
   after
  </i>
  - maybe just seconds after - every one of those sensors has given the 'in air' signal?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Reference was made earlier in this thread to a 'latched' in air FADEC condition that resulted in engine shut downs after the aircraft involved landed and was therefore actually on the ground. But what if some sensor failure had resulted in the aircraft systems believing that the aircraft was now on the ground when it was not? I also note that after the 2009 B737-800 incident at Schiphol &ndash; actually 1.5 kms away, where the aircraft crashed in a field during approach - the investigation ascertained that a RADALT system suddenly sent an erroneous minus 8&rsquo; height reading to the automatic throttle control system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The conceptual description of the TCMA says that the channels monitor the &ldquo;position of thrust lever&rdquo; &ndash; no surprises there &ndash; &ldquo;engine power level&rdquo; &ndash; no surprises there &ndash; and &ldquo;several other digital inputs via digital ARINC data buses&rdquo;.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  WoW should of course be one of those "digital inputs" and be a 1 or 0. But I haven't seen any authoritative post about whether the change in state on the 78 requires only one sensor to signal WoW or if, as is more likely, there are (at least) two sensors &ndash; one on each MLG leg &ndash; both of which have to be &lsquo;weight off&rsquo; before a weight off wheels state signal is sent. Maybe a sensor on each leg sends inputs to the ARINC data and the systems reading the data decide what to do about the different WoW signals, as between 00, 01, 10 and 11.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There is authoritative information to the effect that RADALT is also one of the &ldquo;digital inputs&rdquo; to the TCMA. The RADALTs presumably output height data (that is of course variable with height) and I don&rsquo;t know whether the RADALT hardware involved has a separate 1 or 0 output that says that, so far as the RADALT is concerned, the aircraft to which it is strapped is, in fact, &lsquo;in the air&rsquo; at &lsquo;some&rsquo; height, with the actual height being so high as to be irrelevant to the systems using that input (if that input is in fact generated and there are, in fact, systems that use that 1 or 0).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If we now consider the &lsquo;worst case scenario will be preferred&rsquo; concept that apparently applies to the TCMA design so as to achieve redundancy, the number of sensor inputs it&rsquo;s monitoring to decide whether, and can change its decision whether, the aircraft is on the ground, becomes a very important matter. The TCMA is only supposed to save the day on the ground, if the pilots select idle thrust on a rejected take off but one or both of the engines fail to respond. In the &lsquo;worst case&rsquo; (in my view) scenario, both TCMA channels on both engines will be monitoring/affected by
  <i>
   every
  </i>
  WoW sensor output and
  <i>
   every
  </i>
  RADALT output data and, if
  <i>
   any one of them
  </i>
  says &lsquo;on ground&rsquo;, that will result in
  <i>
   both
  </i>
  engines&rsquo; TCMAs being enabled to command fuel shut off, even though the aircraft may, in fact, be in the air.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Of course it&rsquo;s true that the TCMA&rsquo;s being enabled is not, of itself, sufficient to cause fuel cut off to an engine. That depends on a further glitch or failure in the system or software monitoring engine power and thrust lever position, or an actual &lsquo;too much thrust compared to thrust lever position&rsquo; situation. But I can&rsquo;t see why, on balance, it&rsquo;s prudent to increase the albeit extraordinarily remote risk of an &lsquo;in air&rsquo; TCMA commanded engine or double engine shut down due to multiple sensor failure &ndash; just one in-air / on-ground sensor and one of either the thrust lever sensor/s or engine power sensor/s &ndash; or, in the case of an actual in air &lsquo;too much thrust compared to thrust lever position situation&rsquo;, why that &lsquo;problem&rsquo; could not be handled by the crew shutting down the engine when the crew decides it&rsquo;s necessary. Once in the air, too much thrust than desired is a much better problem to have than no thrust. The latter is precisely what would happen if all &lsquo;on ground / in air&rsquo; sensors were functioning properly and some &lsquo;too much thrust&rsquo; condition occurred.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hopefully the design processes, and particularly the DO-178B/C software design processes done by people with much bigger brains than mine, have built in enough sanity checking and error checking into the system, followed by exhaustive testing, so as to render my thoughts on the subject academic.

  </div>
  I don't think &lsquo;worst case scenario will be preferred&rsquo; is the philosophy they use. The way tdracer explained it, there can't be any single failure that leads to uncommanded high thrust on the ground. Presumably, each FADEC channel is treated as a single 'fault isolation area.' That's why the inactive channel has to be able to effect a shutdown in case the active channel causes a runaway.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the sake of argument, imagine if
  <i>
   every
  </i>
  air/ground sensor had to say 'ground' to enable TCMA. That should still meet the 'no single failure' requirement since you'd need at least 2 failures to get a runaway engine: the original thrust control problem, and a faulty air/ground sensor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  IIRC, he said that the 747-8 looks at weight on wheels, gear truck tilt, and radio altimeters. At least one of each has to say 'ground' for TCMA to be enabled.

   some limited detail on the air/ground system here
  </a>
  . It shows two truck tilt and two strut compression sensors on each of the two MLGs, 8 sensors total. Truck tilt sensors give 'fast' A/G detection; truck tilt + struts gives 'slow' A/G detection. Two systems but no mention of exactly how voting works. No mention of radalt but that could be handled separately before being provided to the FADECs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I am also now thoroughly satisfied that the FADECs have their own alternators, and that these are separate to the flight control alternators integrated into each VFSG.

     . What is apparent is a (substantial) loss of thrust. That's what one can say with some certainty.
    </div>

  The available video and trajectory information are quite conclusive that both engines stopped producing thrust within 12 seconds of the main wheels leaving the ground. Had partial power of any level remained, the aircraft impact would have been further away from the departure end of the runway. The NE end camera shows by using transit sightings against identifiable structures, that the failure occurred while the aircraft was still within the airport boundary area. The energy state of the aircraft at that time trades off to impact at the correct time and place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On departure at these weights the aircraft would have some assumed temperature thrust reduction from max available on the GEnx -1B70, Unless they were carrying lead, they were around 30,000 or more below the limit weight for a flaps 5 TO. At that weight, around 440k lbs, they would have had a fair OEI climb gradient on one engine, certainly a positive gradient with the gear down, so they lost more than 50% of total thrust. There is no yaw or roll, or inputs to counter a yaw or roll moment so the aircraft was symmetrical at all times, that means losing absolutely no less than 50% of total available thrust at that point on each engine. At 50% reduction. the aircraft would have continued a positive gradient with the gear down and the flaps at the TO setting. It did not, it decelerated at around 1meter sec, or 0.1g deceleration for just maintaining level flight, but it also had to descend and that was worth around 0.05g as well. Instead of having any positive thrust margin, the guys were needing to descend to balance the decrement in thrust of around 0.15g, and that means it has negligible to no thrust from the engines. The full analysis takes more effort as the AOA has increased over the 15-20 seconds to impact, which is increasing the drag of the aircraft rapidly towards the end. For the first 5-10 seconds however, it is not such a great change, but it is still increasing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In level flight, the aircraft would accelerate level at around 0.3-0.4g gear down with both engines running at max chuff. Lose one, and you are back to 0.05-0.1g or so. These guys had far less than one engine remaining, gravity was all that they had going for them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To that end, there is no requirement to have the EAFR readout of the N1, N2, FF, or EGT, the video shows they had no puff going worth a darn. That is basic back of the envelope physics and anyone who does aircraft performance testing would be able to get that answer straight from the video without using a calculator, by the time they had watched the video a couple of times in replay.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I have no qualms on stating that the engines are not operating, the RAT, gear tilt are consistent with the dynamics of the aircraft. This is far simpler to determine the energy state than that of the B738W at Muan, the lack of early video required a couple of iterations of the kinetic energy of the aircraft at Muan to end up with a probable flight path, and most likely estimate of the thrust remaining for those most unfortunate souls.

     The gear tilt position is not definitive evidence crew had selected gear up. I've speculated another cause for this non-normal gear tilt is that C hydraulics failed around time of rotation. This would explain the gear remaining in the forward tilt position. There are reasons why the crew may have not selected gear up,

     Therefore we cannot determine wow or air/ground logic from an assumed gear retraction.

  Without knowing the 787-8 gear system, we know that is is supposed to be hydraulically moved from \x94nose up\x94 to nose down as the first step in the gear up sequence. But do we know that it would end up \x94nose down\x94 without hyd pressure?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another point pointing to that the aircraft did consider itself being \x94In Air\x94 is the ADS-B data sending Altitude from the first 575 feet at

   08:08:46.55 until at least 08:50.87\x85?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   I would think the sub systems like TCMA would use the same In Air / On Ground logic as the aircraft normally use?
   <br/>
   I come from an FBW aircraft with a Air/Ground logic that seems rather bullet proof and would
   <b>
    guess
   </b>
   the 787 wouldn\x92t use a less solid logic which probably, in doubt would consider it being \x94In Air\x94?
   <br/>
   It would be \x94logic\x94 for the TCMA to use this logic?
