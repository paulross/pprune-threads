     There are a few comments along the lines of "it is incredibly unlikely that..." this is selection bias in reverse. Something incredibly unlikely
     <b>
      has
     </b>
     happened, and it's contained in this sample set.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     To summarise some known facts about the TCMA system:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     1) TCMA will shut down an engine if:
     <ul>
      <li>
       It believes via multiple redundant sensors indicate the aircraft is on the ground
      </li>
      <li>
       It detects engine power in excess of that set by the thrust levers - subject to a margin to account for engine performance variation - that is determined to be a runaway condition
      </li>
     </ul>
     2) In 2019 an ANA pilot was able to confuse the TCMA by rapidly moving the thrust levers into reverse, to forward and back into reverse again. This caused both engines to shutdown.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     3) Since then the TCMA should have been updated/fixed (and indeed the software will have been updated by SB since the a/c was delivered, to detect a wider range of runaway conditions)
     <br/>
     <br/>
     And speculation:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     4) It may be possible - given the close timings - that a TCMA activation occurred as the a/c was leaving the ground, with kinetic energy and spool down time getting the a/c from the ground to its peak height
     <br/>
     <br/>
     In the recent BA LGW incident the PF reduced thrust to idle at V1, then added thrust back, then committed to a RTO. I wonder if something similar could have occurred:
     <ul>
      <li>
       In error, PF reduces power to idle at a speed approaching V1
      </li>
      <li>
       Engines begin reducing power, but n1 reduces more slowly than the TCMA system is expecting (perhaps because the TCMA margin is calculated when the a/c is stationary, but at 170kt a turbofan will spool down more slowly due to the ram air / windmill effect)
      </li>
      <li>
       TCMA detects a runaway condition - while a/c is on the ground - and cuts off fuel via the relay circuit
      </li>
      <li>
       PF decides to commit to takeoff and rotates, not knowing that TCMA has already activated
      </li>
      <li>
       10-15s after rotation, n1 has now dropped below minimums for electrical generation. Electrics fail, final transponder signal is sent, and RAT is deployed
      </li>
     </ul>
     Obviously this should not be possible, and there are other possibilities.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  If TCMA cut fuel flow while still on the runway the aircraft would have been decelerating from the moment it lifted off, which is not what the ADS-B data indicates. The kinetic energy in the rotating parts of the engine wouldn't add much speed to the aircraft as the engines run down with no more energy being added via fuel.

     They had reached the maximum of 625 ft pressure altitude i.e 436 ft AGL. Must had been super quick in accomplishing the memory items. Just saying.ðŸ˜‡

  </div>
  No, they did not climb that high. Latest FR24 ADS-B report was indeed 625 ft, but that is based on 1013 (STD). With the local QNH being 1000, that 625ft becomes roughly 300ft MSL. Corrected for airport elevation, this is just above 100ft. The last recorded altitude of the aircraft was roughly 100ft AGL, which does not mean it didn\x92t climb a bit higher, but the aircraft reaching 400ft is pure speculation.

      What if the PF called stop just before V1 and closed the thrust levers but either changed his mind or was overridden by the other pilot, who rapidly pushed the thrust levers back up. Could this trigger a TCMA intervention and subsequent dual engine shutdown as it was still on the runway at this point? Hopefully not.

  This is the best theory of TCMA activation so far, but it\x92s still very remote. In this theory there is no need for a TCMA anomaly, it needs only(!) two simultaneous engine anonalies (and sn improper crew action) that would trigger the TCMA as designed. If there are safeguards preventing this happening, they are not mentioned in this thread.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also doesn\x92t explaine the ADS-B data showing acceleration after lift off.

   I'm reading a lot of the comments, speculation is something we all like, but some things just do not add up, even with a RAT deployed

  <span style="color:#000000">
   if they had dual engine failure around 50 feet where you raise the gear, how can they still find the energy to climb, since they would be at VR/V2 speed (not V2+20 at that altitude, what VNAV would command after take off, especially with a take off weight of around 205/210 tons, the 787 wings are amazing but not miracles
  </span>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <span style="color:#000000">
   if they had a normal departure, why did they not raise the gear, they had a positive rate since they were climbing and the speed according to ADS-B was a constant. if they were single engine ! this would have saved them with this weight and weather, one of the first things you learn when EFATO with a 787, raise the gear, your climb performance increases dramatically
  </span>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <span style="color:#000000">
   Intersection take off can be ruled out:
  </span>
  <br/>
  <span style="color:#000000">
   if they did an intersection departure with they're genex 64-70K engines, they would have had a take off limited weight of around 172 tons, I estimate that they were close to 205/210 tons, (max zfw of around 161 tons and around 45/50 tons of fuel) even full length would have been a stress for the engines, with the prevailing weather conditions, they would have never made it, full length is already difficult.
  </span>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <span style="color:#000000">
   When we see the video, the airplane is still climbing / flying straight and level (not losing altitude), yet we hear what we think might be the RAT, I can't imagine that they had the kinetic energy to do this with no engines. if they had dual engine failure, they would have been a brick, Hot and High, no thrust, flaps 5, zero chance.

   flickering of lights etc. seen by the survivor and the loud bang heard, I would not trust pax observations, because of the things they had to go through, also and I've said this before, if it was a loud bang, where is the smoke and fire in the engines, or in the video, its not audible

     On Aviation Herald it is stated that "Government Officials reported the aircraft had a longer than normal takeoff run and used up almost all of the 3905 meters / 1499 feet runway". That would perhaps explain the dust on one of the videos as it passed across usually undisturbed areas. However it also would fit in with the theory in post #1433 that the thrust levers may have been pulled back and hence the aircraft had a period of deceleration before the levers were the quickly pushed forward and confused the TCMA.. It could be that the accident occurred due to what happened on the runway, not the overall config thereafter.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I would take that with a pinch of salt..  Did a 'government official' say that, or is it an official announcement by the government? Big difference..
  <br/>
  Additionally, ADS-B data and the triangulation of the video showing the takeoff would lead you to a different conclusion.

  If you wanted to an analyse this further:
  <br/>
  1. You might mathematically start at TE=0 at start of takeoff-roll, and treat drag as minimal until rotation.
  <br/>
  2. Typically rotation will be to say 15deg nose up, but flight path will be much less (5deg? for heavy hot 787). Once that rotation is complete, aircraft will stop accelerating. Therefore engine thrust (energy gain) equals gain in PE - drag x time.
  <br/>
  3. This might give a better insight into where energy gain/loss became unusual?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Looking at the raw data in your post, and given the speeds are likely IAS based i.e. can be affected by wind, I don't see the IAS loss as equating to dual engine failure i.e. zero thrust - but could be wrong. Once a heavy airliner gets to lift off the acceleration is reduced (drag) and the decays to zero as PE gain kicks in.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ditto a time / distance to the crash site might give some energy info? Looks like the crash site is 50' (?) below the airfield (Google Earth will give more).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I think you are doing an interesting study on the absence of other info

     That is exactly what I am saying - that the only cause that can be
     <i>
      positively
     </i>
     identified at this point is pilot action whether accidental or deliberate. It's the only thing that can be conclusively ruled either in or out by now. However the tone of several of the messages here is that everything else has conclusively been ruled out because it has been three days, which makes no logical sense to me.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ...

  What pilot action is positively ruled in and what pilot action is positively ruled out at this stage?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From the comfort of my couch, I would contend that this crew have had a condition that was extraordinary (in the full meaning of the word) and have acted in a timely and correct manner. There is nothing in the flight path other than the fact the aircraft isn't at a gate in London that indicates otherwise. The fact the aircraft is not sitting in London does not have any characteristic event in the available information to conclude other than through the general assumption that pilots always cause problems, and having done nearly half a century in flight safety investigation in the military and airlines, I would contend that on balance flight crew save aircraft far more often than they cause losses.

     That is exactly what I am saying - that the only cause that can be

     identified at this point is pilot action whether accidental or deliberate. It's the only thing that can be conclusively ruled either in or out by now. However the tone of several of the messages here is that everything else has conclusively been ruled out because it has been three days, which makes no logical sense to me.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     There is no evidence to support an assumption of unlawful interference, it can, and has happened in the past, other than that it is cognitively apathetic to assume that the event is due to such action. The EAFR data will clear that up without question, but at this stage, the RT call indicates otherwise. The flight path also indicates that the crew were commanding the aircraft in a manner consistent with any competent pilot attempting to deal with a catastrophic event.

     To put it another way: if pilot action isn't the root cause, then what exactly is the investigation supposed to say right now other than the utterly redundant "well this is a headscratcher, and we're going to take a while to figure it out"? Are they supposed to turn into Chicken Little screaming that the sky is falling with no evidence-based justification? To be fair, you could perhaps argue that they should come out and "clear" the pilots' names, but that implies an obligation to social media hucksters and mobs that I don't think should exist.

  Not at all, the system including the OEM and Regulator have duty of care obligations that they tend to take seriously, mores than the public gives them credit for normally. In this case, the investigators have data that will shortly be sufficient to determine the immediate actions that would be necessary to mitigate risks to the public. My own opinion is that action is shortly coming, it doesn't need the EAFR, and it will cause its own political fall out.

     Also we should be wary of treating it like an either/or; poor crew response to a manageable fault stemming from a design weakness or maintenance issue is also an option. See e.g. the Swirijaya crash that was initiated by a faulty autothrottle, but the resulting upset was quite preventable and also recoverable even after it had developed.
    </div>

  The B735 crash event was evident from the first access to the ADSB data. The kinematics told the story, which is usually the case. In this case, the flight path is sufficiently clear to be of concern. Specifically, this event from a human-in-the-loop is a binary outcome. There is zero grey areas in the involvement of the flight crew, and I contend that there is no reason to consider their actions as being anything other than exemplary. If the area mic shows otherwise, I will amend my position, but right now, I have greater concerns with the continued operation of the B787. This event is an either/or, a binary event, like Kev Sullivan's QF072, and I fear we are seeing a similar family of causation. Kev's a former squadron mate and friend from the airline, and the pax were fortunate to have him on board that day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The untidy truth related to this event is that either causation will have ramifications to the industry for the foreseeable future; there is nothing trivial about this event from a systems viewpoint, apart from the devastating loss to every person concerned in the tragedy. Not than many accidents are so consequential in their impact, this will be one of those.

     Flightradar24 (I know, I know) has a short blog on the (very minimal) ADS-B data available. There's only around 4s of useful data available from 21ft o 71ft altitude (last packet received 0.8s later), But: it's odd seeing the speed DROPPING shortly after takeoff. Even if you calculate total energy (kinetic + potential) it's falling, i.e. the engines aren't producing thrust. (In fairness reported speed doesn't match my calculated speeds, but even with mine I don't see power). Also: if you assumed no thrust from 71ft AGL @ 172kt you'd reach 250ft at 160kt. Isn't that roughly where they ended up? Noisy data, but this suggests the engines stopped producing power almost as soon as the wheels left the ground. (If someone could download a CSV of another similar flight and send to me I can do a compare and contrast of Total Energy)
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I think this is as interesting a line of inquiry as I've seen recently. The problem is getting the data and theory close enough to be meaningful.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For instance, what about induced drag (admittedly much complicated, I imagine, by varying ground effect) once rotation begins? A comparison with another 787-8 flight from the same runway and under similar conditions (meteorological, load, etc.) might be ideal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Are there not tools accessible to ordinary users for making detailed such simulations, rather than a back of the envelope calculation? I daresay Boeing has made such simulations already, and have a pretty good idea of whether and when thrust loss might have occurred.

     I think it was 650 feet above standard pressure of 1013.
     <br/>
     Correcting for QNH 1001? gives an altitude of 290 ft approx.
     <br/>
     Less 189 ft airfield elevation gives a height AGL of 100 feet.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     But that was based on last ADS-B return. From the video it looks like they reached closer to 200\x92 AGL using wingspan for scale.

  There is no reason to doubt the ADS-B data captured for this event.  It was failure to understand it that led to erroneous assumptions (for example that the aircraft had taken off from an intersection).

     Based on the video taken from the left of the flight path, can we determine at what point of the runway rotation occurred? Is there positive confirmation that the takeoff roll started at the beginning of the runway ? Are the two indicative of trouble before rotation, as the Times states ?

  IMO, I don't know if that is trustworthy - the FR24 ADSB data seems to show that the aircraft was at 21ft AGL between the 1500ft and 2000ft markers from the end of the runway.

     If TCMA cut fuel flow while still on the runway the aircraft would have been decelerating from the moment it lifted off, which is not what the ADS-B data indicates. The kinetic energy in the rotating parts of the engine wouldn't add much speed to the aircraft as the engines run down with no more energy being added via fuel.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I was not aware that we have granular ADS-B data from the a/c itself showing airspeed post rotation (rather than speed interpolated from GPS). Apologies if I have missed it. If it does show acceleration after takeoff I tend to agree with you.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In no particular order, here are some more thoughts on TCMA having caught up on the thread:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If you cut the fuel from two big engines at take-off power, there must be some delay before n2 decays below the threshold for generation (below idle n2), the generators disconnect and RAT deploys. GEnx have relatively long spool up/down times as the fan is so large (and would be exposed to 170+kts of ram air). Perhaps someone has a view on how long this would be, but I imagine it could easily be 10s or more between fuel cut off and RAT deployment. On AI171 the RAT appears to be already deployed at the beginning of the bystander video. That starts c. 13s before impact and around 17s after rotation. This does not prove anything except that the supposed shut down must have happened very close to rotation and
  <u>
   could
  </u>
  have happened just before rotation while the a/c was on the ground.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As a thought experiment, imagine if ANA985 in 2019 had decided to go around. The a/c rotates and is ~50 ft above the runway, suddenly both engines spooling down, very little runway left to land on and no reverse thrust available. I am struck by how similar this scenario is to AI171. This theory would require there to have been unexpected thrust lever movement in the moments before rotation - but plausibly one pilot moving to reject, followed by an overrule or change of heart - or even a simple human error such as the recent BA incident at LGW - could achieve this. This is perhaps more likely that any sensor fault that you would expect to only impact a single engine given the redundancy of systems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tdracer writes that a key requirement of TCMA is to identify an engine runaway in the event of an RTO, in order to allow the a/c to stop on the runway. This will have been tested extensively - it is a big leap to imagine a false activation could be triggered. It did happen on ANA985 but through a very unusual set of inputs including application of reverse (albeit this latter point may not be relevant if TCMA logic does not distinguish between the reverser being deployed or not).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Incidentally there is an assumption the TCMA software version in place on the ANA flight had already been patched and fixed on AI171. That probably is the case but I am not sure it is a known fact.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In summary I remain baffled by this tragic accident. I have not yet read anything that explicitly rules out TCMA activation and it remains a possibility due to the vanishingly small number of factors that could shut down two engines at apparently the exact same moment when they have fully redundant systems. Fuel contamination, for example, has typically impacted each engine a few minutes (at least) apart. I am also cautious (as others have pointed out) of a form of confirmation bias about Boeing software systems with four-letter acronyms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In my mind the cause could equally well be something completely different to anything suggested on this thread, that will only become clear with more evidence. All of the above also incorporates a number of theories, i.e. that there was an engine shutdown - that are not conclusively known.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thank you to the mods for an excellent job.

  Would moving the levers to idle during t/o not engage RTO? I.e. we would see spoilers deployed and maximum braking applied if that were the case?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Or are you suggesting the levers moved back but not exactly to idle for RTO to kick in?

     Im a layman who knows nothing and am just a PPL and am fascinated by the technicals.So does the computer store the recommended flap setting given all the information entered and then decide whether the actual setting used is appropriate and spits out a warning of checklist complete?what would happen if use of the full runway was entered into the computer, but actually they entered at an intersection, surely the info would be wrong ?...
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  The 787 in particular has a system that is fully automated for takeoff calculation. That includes Takeoff Distance, all relevant airspeeds, etc and uses combined sensor data to make pilot error in calculations exceedingly unlikely.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In addition the valid settings for takeoff flaps simply begin at 5\xb0, so anything less isn't even offered. The corresponding alarms will thus always trigger if you don't have at least 5\xb0 flaps set upon setting takeoff thrust, possibly requiring a higher setting depending on the calculated takeoff configuration. As mentioned before in this thread the loading of the accident aircraft should have been far below its maximums, so a 5\xb0 flaps takeoff is quite ordinary, and the aircraft left the runway well short of its end.

  Also the aircraft used the entire runway after backtracking along it since there are no taxiways going that far. This information has been corrected by FR24 a while ago and stems from the incomplete GPS positional data that is inherent in ADS-B tracking, especially on the ground.

     Would it be possible to determine from the video audio wheter the
     <b>
      edit: engine
     </b>
     fan noise (RPM) maches with a normal take off? I know that&rsquo;s a long shot and I&rsquo;m already very impressed by your work, thank you for sharing it.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  It's the elephant in the room regarding the audio, isn't it, but I am not prepared to say either way. There simply is too much city background noise/ambience to discern this from the engine noise from a landing 787.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Of course one taking off would have a different signature. If anyone can point point to one taking off with the rat out we could compare.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  What I find interesting is that I don&rsquo;t see any evidence in the audio of the engine spooling down, which would leave a recogniseable pattern in the audio one should think. So either it is down so much that the fan rpm is down to windmilling already, or it is simply low enough in volume to be already masked by the ambience.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  So taking this and moving into speculative territory for a moment, I think I read somewhere that the video with audio starts 17 seconds after the wheels left the ground.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Provided the engines were windmilling the video audio since I haven't been able to find any obvious spool down, can anyone say anything meaningful on how long it takes for the engines to spool down to windmilling rpm?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  we can then backtrack from the point the video starts. How does that timing then coincide with the ADS-B data ceasing to transmit, for instance?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putting back in the more strictly data-driven hat, I am not prepared to say so far anything about the engine working or not. You guys know more anout why the rat is out.

     If TCMA cut fuel flow while still on the runway the aircraft would have been decelerating from the moment it lifted off, which is not what the ADS-B data indicates. The kinetic energy in the rotating parts of the engine wouldn't add much speed to the aircraft as the engines run down with no more energy being added via fuel.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I was not aware that we have granular ADS-B data from the a/c itself showing airspeed post rotation (rather than speed interpolated from GPS). Apologies if I have missed it. If it does show acceleration after takeoff I tend to agree with you.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In no particular order, here are some more thoughts on TCMA having caught up on the thread:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If you cut the fuel from two big engines at take-off power, there must be some delay before n2 decays below the threshold for generation (below idle n2), the generators disconnect and RAT deploys. GEnx have relatively long spool up/down times as the fan is so large (and would be exposed to 170+kts of ram air). Perhaps someone has a view on how long this would be, but I imagine it could easily be 10s or more between fuel cut off and RAT deployment. On AI171 the RAT appears to be already deployed at the beginning of the bystander video. That starts c. 13s before impact and around 17s after rotation. This does not prove anything except that the supposed shut down must have happened very close to rotation and
  <u>
   could
  </u>
  have happened just before rotation while the a/c was on the ground.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As a thought experiment, imagine if ANA985 in 2019 had decided to go around. The a/c rotates and is ~50 ft above the runway, suddenly both engines spooling down, very little runway left to land on and no reverse thrust available. I am struck by how similar this scenario is to AI171. This theory would require there to have been unexpected thrust lever movement in the moments before rotation - but plausibly one pilot moving to reject, followed by an overrule or change of heart - or even a simple human error such as the recent BA incident at LGW - could achieve this. This is perhaps more likely that any sensor fault that you would expect to only impact a single engine given the redundancy of systems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tdracer writes that a key requirement of TCMA is to identify an engine runaway in the event of an RTO, in order to allow the a/c to stop on the runway. This will have been tested extensively - it is a big leap to imagine a false activation could be triggered. It did happen on ANA985 but through a very unusual set of inputs including application of reverse (albeit this latter point may not be relevant if TCMA logic does not distinguish between the reverser being deployed or not).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Incidentally there is an assumption the TCMA software version in place on the ANA flight had already been patched and fixed on AI171. That probably is the case but I am not sure it is a known fact.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In summary I remain baffled by this tragic accident. I have not yet read anything that explicitly rules out TCMA activation and it remains a possibility due to the vanishingly small number of factors that could shut down two engines at apparently the exact same moment when they have fully redundant systems. Fuel contamination, for example, has typically impacted each engine a few minutes (at least) apart. I am also cautious (as others have pointed out) of a form of confirmation bias about Boeing software systems with four-letter acronyms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In my mind the cause could equally well be something completely different to anything suggested on this thread, that will only become clear with more evidence. All of the above also incorporates a number of theories, i.e. that there was an engine shutdown - that are not conclusively known.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thank you to the mods for an excellent job.

     Im a layman who knows nothing and am just a PPL and am fascinated by the technicals.So does the computer store the recommended flap setting given all the information entered and then decide whether the actual setting used is appropriate and spits out a warning of checklist complete?what would happen if use of the full runway was entered into the computer, but actually they entered at an intersection, surely the info would be wrong ?...
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  The 787 in particular has a system that is fully automated for takeoff calculation. That includes Takeoff Distance, all relevant airspeeds, etc and uses combined sensor data to make pilot error in calculations exceedingly unlikely.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In addition the valid settings for takeoff flaps simply begin at 5\xb0, so anything less isn't even offered. The corresponding alarms will thus always trigger if you don't have at least 5\xb0 flaps set upon setting takeoff thrust, possibly requiring a higher setting depending on the calculated takeoff configuration. As mentioned before in this thread the loading of the accident aircraft should have been far below its maximums, so a 5\xb0 flaps takeoff is quite ordinary, and the aircraft left the runway well short of its end.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also the aircraft used the entire runway after backtracking along it since there are no taxiways going that far. This information has been corrected by FR24 a while ago and stems from the incomplete GPS positional data that is inherent in ADS-B tracking, especially on the ground.

  Looking at the detailed ADS-B data released by FR24 and the June 10 AI171 data, I noticed that the two flights show the following data at similar points in the takeoff phase
  <br/>
  Height :575ft
  <br/>
  Speed :182kts
  <br/>
  Even though it is impossible that the takeoff weight and outside air conditions are the same on the two flights, we guess that there was nothing wrong at this moment.

     It seems pretty unlikely that a bird strike that took out both of those

      very big

     engines simultaneously would not have been fairly obvious in ways that nearby observers (e.g., the crew, ATC, airport personnel?) would have noticed. Possible, of course, but I don't think we've seen any evidence that points in that direction.

   </div>

  Agreed.
  <br/>
  Also, I expect the airport would've sent a car out to check the runway for evidence. Since we agree that the engine failure occurred near rotation, and that rotation occured well inside the runway (

       The Indian authorities indicated that a bird strike has been ruled out.

    </div>
    A poster in the closed thread pointed out, properly I think, that the
    <i>
     Times
    </i>
    shouldn't be relied upon for presentation or interpretation of technical information. Like most general news organizations, their reporters and editors (mostly) just don't have the background to assess, filter and explain complex processes and technology. Unlike many, though, the
    <i>
     Times
    </i>
    can generally be relied upon to seek appropriate sources and report accurately what those sources say. I think it's very likely that Indian authorities
    <i>
     have
    </i>
    ruled out a bird strike, and I also think those authorities are competent to make that decision.
   </div>
  </div>
  The problem with these reports is that the Indian AAIB and DGCA websites ( aaib.gov.in
  <a href="http://www.dgca.gov.in" target="_blank">
   www.dgca.gov.in
  </a>
  ) are mute on the subject of this crash, so even the DGCA inspection mandate quoted above is shakily sourced. On Friday, AvHerald had already updated with "On Jun 13th 2025 the DGCA reported, that initial preliminary findings rule out a bird strike as no bird carcasses have been found." I searched for a source for this, and found an "exclusive" which read, "The initial probe report of the Ahmedabad Air India crash, accessed by CNN-News18, reveals key findings from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation\x92s assessment led by the director of security." Other media simply quoted News18. There are two reasons to be skeptical here:
  <br/>
  \x95 first, we have seen fake reports circulating;
  <br/>
  \x95 secondly, News18 rates badly on mediabiasfactcheck.com: "Launched in 2005, CNN-News18 (formerly CNN-IBN) is an English-language Indian news television channel based in India. We also rate them Questionable based on a poor fact-checking record with numerous false claims."
  <br/>
  That leads me to consider that this "exclusive" might be sloppy reporting based on a fake\x97I have no way to know whether it is legitimate or not.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At this point, I feel we can only rely on information being official if it's published through an official website, or if there's independent reporting or a video clip from an official press briefing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I do believe the accident was not caused by an animal strike, for many reasons.
  <br/>
  But I wouldn't believe it based on unsourced reporting alone.
