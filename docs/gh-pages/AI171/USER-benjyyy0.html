  The pilot is being quoted as saying to ATC:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Mayday...no thrust, losing power, unable to lift"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I don't think a pilot with over 8000 hours experience would mistakenly diagnose that. Also corroborates with the RAT being deployed. Question is how do both engines lose thrust. Bird strike is the obvious one. Fuel contamination seems unlikely.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I see a post above showing how its possible an electrical failure can result in power loss. Passengers on the flight before this said there were issues in the cabin; lights, displays and air con was not working. Again, seems v unlikely to be related.

     I am curious how this can happen? The handle for the gear is on a completely different place in the cockpit that the flaps handle.
     <br/>
     Possibly a B787 pilot could give us an idea?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     What is nearby the flaps handle are the switches for the "fuel control".
     <br/>
     <br/>

  You are thinking about it in the wrong way. It's probably not even that they intend to retract the gear but pull the wrong lever, more that the mistake is intending to retract the flaps and doing so because they thought they had already done the gear or that they weren't thinking at all. We all have times, especially when tired, when we run on 'autopilot' without realising in the moment or just have a complete brain fart (eg. looking for your keys when they are in your hand). Nothing is completely failsafe. Thats why they do confirmations as a mitigant but it only takes a couple of holes in the Swiss cheese model to line up and things can snowball from there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I don't think its the likely explanation here though given the evidence so far.

     The Mayday specified loss of control and engine failure.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  There have been conflicting reports about the call to ATC. Original reports quoted the Captain saying "Mayday...no thrust, losing power, cannot lift". But I've seen reports today stating the call was simply "Mayday, Mayday" and then no further response.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Difficult to confirm so I wouldn't put too much weight behind it until something more official is released.

     The mayday reports are so unreliable / inconsistent that you simply cannot base any theory on these alone. It is best to focus on some other aspect at this time.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Some have questioned whether a solitary 'communication' was optimal, given the timings, circumstances and the prioritisation of aviation &amp; navigation. I see both sides of that particular argument. But the idea of making a
     <i>
      second
     </i>
     call during a flight that was airborne for less than 30 seconds to repeat a mayday? I find that hard to believe.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I agree that it has been inconsistent, but for what its worth, the most recent version which seems to have come from a press conference on Saturday and being quoted by the likes of CNBC and News18, is that there was a single call lasting 5 seconds from the Captain which read:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <span style="color:#050505">
   \x93MAYDAY\x85 MAYDAY\x85 MAYDAY\x85 NO POWER\x85 NO THRUST\x85 GOING DOWN\x85"

  Not knowledgeable to know about a lot of this myself but interested in views. His calculation asserts that it was not a dual engine flameout to cover the distance it did but there must have been at least some thrust provided to do so.
