  No, and editors no longer hold their feet to the fire.

  Have never flown 787. Comment only about the investigation which is underway.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With GE and Boeing sending expert reps to India (engine and aircraft manufacturers respectively) digging into the details should inform them of what occurred, but as I understand the process, the public information flow will come from the Nation whom they are assisting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Have any of you who have done investigations at this level seen it work out otherwise?

  Aside: five of my work colleagues were either born in Gujarat, or their parents were. I asked
  <br/>
  "I realize that India is a very big place, but are you concerned about any relatives being among the casualties?"
  <br/>
  I got four head shakes (no) and one reply that got me to almost spill my coffee.
  <br/>
  "Nobody in my {extended} family would live near to an airport. It's too noisy."
  <br/>
  It took me a second to register that as a "no" presented in a way that I wasn't expecting.

     Or does TCMA have the authority to shut down any engine, whatever the operating state of the other engines may be, as long as the condition "not flying" is satisfied?

  As I read back to explanations of TCMA further up, an additional criterion seems to be that
  <u>
   the engine is at idle

  . I don't think that your curt summary fits, due to being incomplete.

     Also, so far there is no evidence I've seen regarding the 'chicken-egg' problem, did the engines fall below idle (fuel, stall...) and this caused an electrical blackout (-&gt; battery, RAT...) or did an EE problem cause the engines to reduce thrust (FADEC, SW bug...). And where is the common cause in all this?   There has to be a systematic error common to both engines, an external failure affecting both or a dependent fault with one affecting the other within seconds. This is the only thing I think everyone agrees here. And I refuse to beleave the external failure or dependent fault was sitting in the cockpit.
     <br/>
     I think it is something not common to every aircraft type for the last 50 years.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  While I enjoyed your post, a lot, 787 has been in service for over a decade and there are over 1,000 of them doing their duty day in and day out.  Yes, battery issues arose, but resolved.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Based on the mishap investigations I did, more than one of which involved fatalities, there is a whole family of maintenance / company culture errors possible that seem to me to get short shrift in the discussion here: thread number 1 and thread number 2.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But here's the problem: Air India, for very understandable reasons, isn't about to open the kimono until they are forced to.

     Procedures - There's the (at my airline weekly I think) procedure to 'sump' the tanks. There are drain points in the tank. Valves that you can push in with a tool and fluid drains. As described earlier (and videos exist on YouTube), you drain about a gallon of fluid and examine it for water. Most often in temperate climates (my experience), there's a few 'beads' of water in the bottom of the jug, moving about like mercury.
     <br/>
     Except when there's more.
     <br/>
     Sometimes there's a clear line in the jug, half water, fuel above. And sometimes a gallon of water, that smells like fuel. You drain it until you are sure there's no water.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Yeah, some fuel samples make you go "Whaaat?" And then you keep draining fuel to see how much is in there, and you call up the Maintenance Control folks and tell them "We have a bad sample out here, call those idiots at the fuel farm..."

    Could 'that much' water have condensed in the tank? Well - There's the question. I guess the basis of the theory is that on descent into DEL, the wing tanks picked up some very humid air, which settled water into the tanks through the night. Then, as the theory I posited must work, the wing pumps must have circulated and suspended that water into the fuel.
    <br/>
    By design, the water from the CDG-DEL arrival should have been consumed in the DEL-AMD Sector.
    <br/>
    But desperately clinging to defending my theory (I appreciate this is a hole), lets assume that at DEL the pumps were running for a long time.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Lets assume that the pumps allowed the water to be dispersed within the tank prior to being used through the engines. Then - in the DEL-AMD sector, the wing tanks could have picked up more water.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    How much water would cause a sustained flameout?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I never posited a sustained flameout. I posited a significant reduction in thrust. Listening back to the rooftop video, which at first we were all listening for evidence of RAT, there's also a rhythmic pop-pop-pop of engines struggling.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I think the engines were running, albeit badly.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Heavily water contaminated fuel will do that. It doesn't have to be 100% water. Just enough water to make the engine lose thrust. Your 2 gallons per second figure assumes the engine running at full flow.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'm not a figures man, I'll not challenge that, I do recall flowmeters at max thrust spin like crazy. But an engine struggling due to a high percentage of contamination, is that using 2 gal/sec? or just trying to? What happens if there is e.g. 20% water in the fuel?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There are also reported incidents of engine flameout / thrust reduction that have all happened at altitude. Incidents that have been recovered due to the altitude and time available.
    <b>
     I Posited that the engines would have eventually regained full thrust once the contamination worked though. But 30 seconds of rough engine is very different at 40,000 feet than it is at 100 feet.
    </b>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The theory also relies on a second part - the electrical failure.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That the electrical failure causes the fuel supply to switch, a few seconds after the failure. We go, at the point of electrical failure from a pumped centre tank supply to a sucked wing tank supply. It takes time for that different fuel to reach the engine.
   </div>
  </div>
  I like the cut of your jib.
  <br/>
  Not sure if you are right, and not familiar enough with 787 to check the fuel flow logic, but a friend of mine dead-sticked a single engine trainer into a field due to water in the fuel ... 20 minutes after takeoff.
  <br/>
  It could have happened earlier.

     There is absolutely nothing unusual about the 787 arrangement in this regard.

  Unless one is on PPRuNe, a haven for the garden variety Boeing-basher. (Though at times B seem to bring it on themselves...)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From two threads I see this: a sudden loss of thrust was the initiating event after a successful take off - all of this other electronic stuff was a result of that.
  <br/>
  What I will be paying close attention to is what information comes out as regards maintenance and ground handling for that particular hull...and what isn't said. (I guess that may be a while in coming - and I do agree in the general sense that giving the benefit of the doubt is a good position to take at this point in time).

     As per my training, don't let communicate interfere with aviate. If you can do both simultaneously, go ahead. For me, "communicate" could be taking your mind away from task to formulate and interact in discussion. So yes, we don't allow a complex discussion to preempt flying the plane. For me, pressing a mic switch and calling Mayday is more instinctive and muscle memory, than distracting. If a pilot got a Mayday out, good for them! I can't see it helping much for the doomed flight, other than being a valuable "very soon after the event" indicator that the pilots knew that something very bad was happening. I've known pilots to wrestle control for seconds/minutes in an effort to regain control, before issuing a Mayday. Okay, tasks in priority. But in this case, it appears that a pilot issued a Mayday even before control was actually lost - a valuable timestamp on the order of events for investigation.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I got the idea that with no (or very little) thrust, and with the aircraft falling, the pilot (may have) realized that he was in
  <i>
   out of control flight
  </i>
  , and falling.
  <br/>
  In a pedantic sense: if you make control inputs, and the aircraft won't or can't respond to them, you are in
  <i>
   out of control flight
  </i>
  .
  <br/>
  The whole event happened pretty quickly. How far into "we are doomed" that his senses told him they were can have informed his decision to say something about it. (the human mind is an interesting thing).
  <br/>
  There's also the matter of temporal distortion which can happen during stress or high adrenalin events. (I experienced that during the course of an aircraft accident: not on topic for this thread).
  <br/>
  As to conformance with ICAO, not all investigations make good on that.
