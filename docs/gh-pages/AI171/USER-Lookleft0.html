  There have been a few accidents where the thrust levers were at idle right up to the point of impact. Turkish airlines in Amsterdam and Asiana in SFO. I think a lot of pilots are of the view that the thrust levers are set and forget. Whether the fuel stopped through a shut-off by equipment failure or a mismanaged event by the crew I think pilots should regain the practice of keeping a hand on the T/L whenever they are airborne and in the take-off or landing phase. I'm not blaming the crew in this accident but I can well imagine the confusion in processing a series of indications from EICAS that the aircraft was no longer capable of climbing. They simply would not have had the time to do even the most rudimentary G.R.A.D.E. or whatever acronym for decision making AI use to have recovered the situation. Airline pilots are not test pilots and are taught to be methodical in dealing with an emergency. If it transpires that it was a fault with the engines, either software or hardware, then the regulatory authorities need to consider the validity of 370 minutes ETOPS.

    In both cases the crew had realized the problem and manually advanced the throttle levers before impact--just not soon enough.

  Both crews responded to the stick shaker, they were not aware of the problem up to that point. My point being the T/L should always have the PFs hand on them so that they know what the T/Ls are doing.

    Assuming there is some credence to the article, dual engine failure due to water contamination is the leading theory.

  No it can't be. All discussion about power loss is to be focused on TMCA, FADEC and RATs being deployed. Anything else has already been discussed.

  I'm not suggesting you are wrong wheelsright, my post to you was in response to posts I have made about potential fuel contamination, being removed. A central point of failure is more likely than the simultaneous shutdown by systems on two separate engines at the point at which the aircraft left the ground. If what is being speculated on is possible then all ETOPs approval should be removed and the engine manufacturers told to start again.

  I can guarantee you that the investigation is way ahead of this thread as they won't be stuck on a hamster wheel of irrelevant theories. The investigators are under no obligation to keep the general public informed minute by minute of where the investigation is. They are obliged under annex 13 to release a preliminary report in 30 days of the accident then its every 6 months, if there is anything to report. Anything that is important to release to the engine and airframe manufacturers will be done as a separate part of the process. Having been involved in the investigation process I can tell you from first hand experience that pet theories, as expounded on these pages, are like trying to cure cancer with just a petrie dish.
