     Condolences to all the people who have lost loved ones:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I have a question about that: As the plane would have been fully fueled (say 50t), a full flight and full luggage etc - and if it didn't have enough speed for - say no flaps, short takeoff, pulled up before V1 - and assuming both engines were 'ok':
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Aren't aircraft nowadays require only one engine for a takeoff in an emergency (one assumes that would be a in fully loaded configuration)...?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     If so, then surely two fully good engines should have no problem, particularly when it's taken off already...?
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  as discussed above it\x92s very unlikely this aircraft was fully fueled since the flight is far less than its maximum range.
  <br/>

     I'm sorry but pilots are taught to recognise lack of acceleration during takeoff. They're also taught about cross checking FMC entries during setup. How are they taught? By me and many others.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Even if the pilots had the wrong FMC performance, it would be noticed in the before takeoff cxl.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  being taught, even taught well by the best instructors, and cross-checking, are things that reduce but do not eliminate risk.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  \x93Would be noticed\x94 is inappropriately strong as even the best sometimes make mistakes, even two people making the same mistake. Look at how many investigations contain a line like \x93and the discrepancy was not noticed in cross-checking\x94.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  that said, it doesn\x92t smell like incorrect performance data, given that they left the runway at roughly the same place as previous flights on the same type and route.

     Hi everyone, 787 driver here, well lets look at the facts we see
     <br/>
     very late rotation, but pitch and departure path look like normal up until stalling point.
     <br/>
     mayday was called but without clarification or purpose, for me this indicates stress in the flight deck, especially low level
     <br/>
     no smoke or fire from engines, I would rule out severe damage or birdstrikes at this point
     <br/>
     Flaps 5 departure would be difficult to see as a pixel on a bad video, but they would not have made the rotation at that speed so I assume they used flaps during departure, also you would neglect to ECL's and a config warning
     <br/>
     no RAT to be seen either, again ruling out dual engine failure, also the climb would not have been so parabolic
     <br/>
     maybe single engine fuel starvation/Mechanical issue/dirty fuel, but seems unlikely, the flight path is too gentle
     <br/>
     Gear stays down, and even though the pitch remains the same, they start losing lift and basically stall the aircraft into the ground
     <br/>
     don't forget, Air India uses 64/67K engines on they're 787's, with temp of 41 degrees (ambient, so even more above tarmac) and a QNH of 1001, those engines will be pushed to "hard work mode" already
     <br/>
     <br/>
     IMHO, two things I could assume happend
     <br/>
     - either single engine failure, no pitch adjustment and speed fell below Vstall, OR, most likely
     <br/>
     - mixup of Flaps moved to up position in stead of Gear moved to up position, that would clarify the gear, would clarify the loss of lift and that the engines have no smoke, and no RAT,
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  a few things stated as fact there without any evidence to support the assertions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  very late rotation - stated several times on this thread but zero evidence for it and some analysis suggests the rotation was at roughly the same location as previous departures of the same flight
  <br/>
  <br/>
  no RAT - others, including one with a lot of experience with the sound of a deployed RAT, insist that it was deployed. The video evidence is unclear.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Not saying you\x92re necessarily wrong about anything but I take issue with those that state as fact things that are not (yet) supported by any evidence at all

     There have been reports of a Mayday call but I cannot find it online. Is this a rumour by the press or did it really happen?
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  It has been mentioned repeatedly in this thread, including supposed transcripts of what was said, but no audio recording has surfaced, nor an explanation of where the transcripts came from, so I would call it a rumour.

     Yet credence is given here to his recollection of a bang and green lights etc, yet his comments about THRUST increasing are ignored by the RAT theorists\x85
    </div>

  </div>
  I don\x92t give credence to any of his recollections. I do find the recorded sound of the RAT quite compelling after watching some other videos of a deployed RAT and hearing from the chap who hears them fly over while testing them every day. The photo of the section of wing in the wreckage with flaps still extended also puts paid to the other main theory, in my mind.

     The recordings are simply of too low quality to draw any conclusions from.

     <br/>
     If it was dual engine failure shortly after rotation,
     <b>
      that is very bad luck

     Retracting the flaps would put them at the back of the power curve where drag increases with decreasing speed, causing the speed to reduce further!
     <br/>
     The trouble seems to start at the exact moment the gear should have been raised, putting the flaps up, iso the gear, would cause the kind of loss of lift you see in the video. From there on, being at the back of the power curve, only firewalling the thrust levers and extending the flaps again could have saved them.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  and how do you explain the gear starting the retraction sequence (bogie tilt) and then stopping? A lot of mental gymnastics going on here to try to make a preconceived scenario fit the facts
