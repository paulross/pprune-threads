     As a 787 Crewmember, this thread is unreadable and useless. This site used to be a great resource for professionals worldwide to share info, not anymore.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Please create 2 threads, one for those that have some relevant aviation knowledge to this event and another for the endless SLF questions.
     <br/>
     PPrune could probably get more site traffic doing so.
    </div>
   </div>

  Please feel free to start such a thread.

  We are flat out trying to keep this one within reason, regardless of your feelings otherwise.

     Thank you for your service, you have a thankless job! And I do appreciate input from other aviation professionals such as those you mentioned, but SLF could somehow be rooted out? Reading one reasonable post is akin to unearthing a gold nugget!

  To date over the past 13 hours some 200+ posts have been Moderated out of the thread by 4/5 Mods, each of whom have read the whole thread and do their very best to leave only those posts pertinent to the discussion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  You and others can help if you see anything we miss by either replying with a correction, or Reporting the post for our attention.

  It is obvious to the Mod Team that there is an overwhelming amount of posts from PPRuNers new and old who have not read the thread nor used the Search function before bursting into print.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the sake of our sanity and personal time this thread is closed for a couple of hours to give you all time to actually read it before launching into your version of events.

  Until we have the time and ability to sort out which is which it will be closed.

  This is a new thread with a small selection of the contributions from the original Air India crash thread which is now closed. By no means comprehensive they give a grounding for further discussion here on PPRuNe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Please remember this is a Professional Pilots forum, and speculation by new signups, SLF and others will only be accepted if proven relevant and accurate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On a lighter note we achieved our highest number of viewers ever a couple of days ago, highlighting the interest that PPRuNe has as a source of factual information across the Forums. My sincere thanks to our regular members and to the Mod Team for their continued hard work behind the scenes üëç

  Obviously time for yet another reminder to read the threads and refrain from repeating questions and answers that have already been raised.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is verging on the edge of becoming a Hamsterwheel and We Mods have far more to do on the Site than read back over pages of speculation and guesswork to weed out the gems that really contribute.

     Hoover from the generally respected Pilot Debrief channel put up his analysis.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     He analyses the point of rotation looking at the airport layout and using the video with the shack showing the aircraft rotate behind it, in that case the aircraft rotates at a reasonably normal place. That being the case what is the "cloud of particles" that appear to the left of the aircraft ?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     He discounts electrical failure affecting both engines due 787 design, and fuel contamination due both engines fed from separate tanks unlikely to affect both engines at the same time.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The possibility that one engine failure occurred at a critical point in the take off and that possibly the wrong engine fuel cutoff switch was pulled.

  All of which has been discussed and for the wing vortices and the fuel feed has been explained quite comprehensively, along with the fuel cut offs: have you not read these posts only made recently?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I repeat, do
  <b>
   NOT

  post repeats of discussions already had unless there is something of value which may change or enhance previous posts. This is a prime example of a post which should be vetted and dismissed before pressing Submit Reply üôà

     That's ~950m (3100 ft.) from the threshold, and 2.5 km from the accident site.

  Having given this thread plenty of time to settle, plus plenty of notice from various Mods, it has become a Hamsterwheel with no beneficial posts contributing to the thread for some time. That is including the dozens of Moderated posts you don't get to see, just in the past 24 hours!
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thread closed until the next
  <b>
   official
  </b>
  announcement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, those of you now with time on their hands, please consider updating your Personal Profile to
  <b>

    On the evening of 24 June 2025, the team led by DG AAIB with technical members from AAIB and NTSB began the data extraction process. The Crash Protection Module (CPM) from the front black box was safely retrieved, and on 25 June, 2025, the memory module was successfully accessed and its data downloaded at the AAIB Lab.The analysis of CVR and FDR data is underway. These efforts aim to reconstruct the sequence of events leading to the accident and identify contributing factors to enhance aviation safety and prevent future occurrences.
