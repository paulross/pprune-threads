  Knowing nothing else but watching that, it looked like the plane was very heavy, got out of ground effect, and started sinking again. The pilot, if that was true, needed to level off and gain speed.

     Didn't the 73max stay operational after the Lion air accident?

  How long did 737s fly with rudders that got stuck?

  Maybe a dumb question - A DA-42 went in with double engine failure when the gear was retracted, the additional load of the gear pump was enough to drop the bus voltages low enough to shut down both FADECs. They took off with a very low battery and no one had tested this scenario previously. Obviously a very different airplane, but still raising the gear probably is a significant load and may have caused an electrical problem to get worse.
  <br/>
  * or Boeing thought of that, DA-42s got rewired and won't do that now.

  Re water in fuel - how often do 787 operators usually check the water drains? It seems like the water scavenger would normally deal with it, but if it gets clogged or otherwise doesn't work you'll get water out of the sump drains.

     I got the idea that with no (or very little) thrust, and with the aircraft falling, the pilot (may have) realized that he was in
     <i>
      out of control flight
     </i>
     , and falling.
     <br/>
     In a pedantic sense: if you make control inputs, and the aircraft won't or can't respond to them, you are in
     <i>
      out of control flight
     </i>
     .
     <br/>
     The whole event happened pretty quickly. How far into "we are doomed" that his senses told him they were can have informed his decision to say something about it. (the human mind is an interesting thing).
     <br/>
     There's also the matter of temporal distortion which can happen during stress or high adrenalin events. (I experienced that during the course of an aircraft accident: not on topic for this thread).
     <br/>
     As to conformance with ICAO, not all investigations make good on that.

       China Eastern 5735

       On 21 March 2025 (the third anniversary of the accident), the CAAC did not release an annual investigation progress report or a final investigation report,
       <b>
        as required by the Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation and CAAC's own coded regulations
       </b>
       .
       <br/>
       <br/>
       On 19 May 2025, in response to an open government information request, the CAAC said that it decided not to release the interim investigation report to the public because releasing the report might "endanger national security and societal stability".

     I sincerely hope that this one does.

     (Note: some of what I refer to as
     <i>
      out of control flight
     </i>
     seems to be called
     <i>
      upset
     </i>
     in commercial transport jargon).

  They were neither out of control nor upset. They just had little or no power. The plane flew just fine as a glider until it hit a building.
