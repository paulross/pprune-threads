  How can an MCP ALT setting error explain the sequence seen in the videos?  If the MCP ALT is set too low the aircraft levels off, reduces thrust to maintain set speed, - AND MAINTAINS MCP ALTITUDE.  Sure it will get the crew's attention but it will not result in a uncontrolled descent.

     Easy to get tunnel vision on the Flight Guidance cue in the HUD.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I am familiar with that having worked on HUD development.  However, what FD/GC mode would be be active that  would command a descent after an altitude capture from below?  I would expect FD and GC to be in ALT HOLD mode.  I don't know the 787 but I would have expected GC to command ALT HOLD until low speed protection activated if thrust had been lost.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If thrust was lost the aircraft is coming down regardless of MCP ALT or GC command.

  Exactly like the action of lifting the flap lever out of detent before moving it.  What is significantly different is that you would have to do it twice.  It is that which makes it improbable unless intentional.

     One of the two recorders on the 787 is equipped with RIPS (Recorder Independent Power Supply), which will give a minimum of 10 minutes' operation in the event of a power supply failure.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  But as previously posted a recorder is only as good as the systems that provide the data to it. If those systems, or some of those systems, are not powered the data is simply not available to be recorded. You need the DFDAU (or equivalent) to be powered and you need the systems that feed data to the DFDAU (or equivalent) to be powered and operational.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Edit to add - RIPS will likely maintain CVR function.

     Back to the subject of the TCMA, in order for the four channels (A and B for engine 1 and A and B for engine 2) to be truly independent, there would have to be, for example, four, separate weight on wheels sensors and two, separate throttle position sensors per throttle. I would be extraordinarily surprised if that's what has been implemented, but will happily stand correct.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Well, I was looking at the drawings of the MD-11 thrust control module and there certainly are two sensors on each thrust lever. The sensors are implemented as a dual resolver on a common shaft. This level of redundancy is well understood by those who specify, design, test, and certify critical aircraft systems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Edit - tdracer posted as I was typing. It seems 787 has even greater sensor separation.

     Thanks. From that I assume that the thrust resolver signal is fed to the FADEC alone ?. The reason for the clarification was that it was not clear if the signal is fed to other subsystems, which could affect the analysis.

  That is certainly typical. The FADEC/EEC/ECU includes the resolver angles in its output data for consumption by other systems such as displays and flight controls.

     Uncommanded high trust on (at least one of) the engines during the TO-roll, in particular past V1, resulting in a discrepancy with the actual (likely derated)thrust settings, could have triggered TMCA on or just before lift-off.

  In the CSV data set that can be downloaded from that link the first point with altitude data is 1630 ft short of the departure threshold. That point is 575. The highest alt recorded in the data set is 625. All the points with altitude data overlay the departure runway. I do not understand how anyone is using this data set to determine the maximum altitude which was way past the departure end.

  Edit to add -  I have made no attempt to correct the raw ADS-B altitude data.   There is no need to make any correction to see altitude gain.

     FR24 did do that raw ADS-B data comparison. Remember the GPS position and barometric altitude are sent by the aircraft itself. The altitude is sent in 25 ft intervals, so a shallow curve that is smooth in reality looks janky in the data, due to the rounding of the numbers. From
     <a href="https://www.flightradar24.com/blog/flight-tracking-news/major-incident/air-india-171-crashes-shortly-after-take-off-from-ahmedabad/" target="_blank">

     </a>
     :
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The red line is the accident flight, and it covers approximately 4.3 seconds.
     <br/>
     Obviously the altitudes are all uncorrected for barometric pressure, which would've varied with the weather on that day; you kind of have to mentally shift the lines vertically downward.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  There seems to be an assumption that, if corrected for local altimeter, the lines all move down toward the runway as a set.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wouldn't that only be true if the altimeter setting was the same on all the days those flights were made?  Isn't that improbable?

     I'd like to stick my neck out and say what I think I know. And I do mean "know", not what I think "likely" or "possible".
     <br/>
     <br/>
     3. The FR24 graphic posted by Musician shows that the aircraft became initially airborne "as usual", compared with other TO profiles. (Info from FR24.)
     <br/>
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I am not convinced that the FR24 graphic shows that.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The FR24 data shows that, for the accident flight, the first data point received on takeoff was one that included altitude. We know where the aircraft was and we know the uncorrected baro altitude at that point.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  We do not know how the altitude of that first point compares to the altitude of the reference flights unless all flights have their altitude adjusted by the
  <u>
   prevailing
  </u>
  altimeter correction.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Each trace starts in about the same place over the runway but this may not be useful data. I don't think this is the ADS-B ground/air transition. I think it is the point at which reception of ADS-B data becomes possible because of transmission "line of sight". We don't know if data starts being received as a result of increased altitude or because of passing by whatever was blocking the signal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I'm sure someone could research the altimeter setting for each of the reference flight and produce a corrected data set. That would be interesting and useful data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That's just my interpretation of the data I have seen. It is not presented as fact.

  Perhaps a necessary but not sufficient condition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some critical systems are designed with processing "lanes" having dissimilar processors as well as dissimilar code. Each lane is developed from separate requirements that trace up to one high level system requirements specification. If that high level specification has errors the errors flow into all the independent lanes of processing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Testing may not find such errors since the system works as specified.

  The issue with 5G was the potential for interference with some models of radio altimeter. I think we have been told that RA is used in 787 air/ground logic.  We have also been told that air/ground state is used to enable TCMA.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I think it very unlikely that 5G interference was a contributing factor but I can see why someone would be interested in asking the question.

  The last report received from ADS-B out is 625 ft but, at that point, the aircraft is still over the runway. The video shows the aircraft continued to climb after passing the departure end.

  There is no conflict. Simply a lack of ADS-B data.
