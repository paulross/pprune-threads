     With 'intact' being the crucial part of these recent posts. It is my understanding that a suitably equipped LAME can simply download the FDR data from an installed EAFR (CVR requires dismounting). So downloading as such, isn't the issue.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  You may be thinking of a Quick Access Recorder (QAR), which is indeed designed to be downloaded in situ. They've been around for a while.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That aside, I think we're agreed that downloading an intact FDR/EAFR is probably several orders of magnitude easier than one that's been burnt, battered or bruised.

  The RIPS provides power to both the recorder and to the microphones in the cockpit.... If there's no power to the microphones, there is nothing to hear. If there's no power for systems in the aircraft.... then there's not going to be much for any recorder to record.

     In reverse order, and the first one being very speculative: The type of battery will likely be highly specific for the usecase, here rugged before anything else. Likely specialized chemistry or one of those hybrid solid state ones. Commonly they trade capacity for other features.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Regarding the recording feature, there's three types of microphone commonly used nowadays: Condenser and Ribbon type are somewhat fragile and require power to record audio while Dynamic type is basically a reverse speaker and is considered rugged. There's an off chance that a Piezzo microphone would be used here as they are basically indestructible but usually reserved for recording while in contact with a large sound transducer. My guess based on that is that we're looking at a dynamic microphone with a run of the mill preamp.
     <br/>
     Depending on the actual electric setup this would yield a handful of different possible installations:
     <br/>
     1) The "Cockpit Area Microphone" (hereby christened CAM because I like abbreviations) is a self contained unit consisting of a Microphone, a preamp and AD converter. This would mean while provided power the digital recording could be passed to either EAFR.
     <br/>
     2) The CAM is a self contained unit consisting of a Microphone and a preamp. This would mean while provided power it could send an analog audio signal to the forward EAFR no problem, but would potentially struggle generating enough of a signal to be picked up by the rear EAFR.
     <br/>
     3) The CAM is just a Microphone. This would mean it requires either no or very little power (even Condenser Mics usually require only Milliwatts) but the signal would be very hard to send over long distances and would require the EAFR to have a preamp.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     In general it is audio engineering 101 to place a preamp as close to the source as possible to avoid noise. Thus I would rule out 3. It has both ups and downs to convert the analog signal to a digital signal, and there is a possibility they'd do both. In either case I am confused from an audio engineering standpoint why the rear EAFR would not pickup audio from the CAM if the forward EAFR does. Unless the rear EAFR is fed (audio) data only via BUS, which would be an interesting choice.
     <br/>
     Also keep in mind that historically the CVR was also located in the tail section and very much received an analog signal over the entire distance. There's really no technical reason this wouldn't be possible, I routinely use far longer cables when running audio signals at concerts and those can't use compression because it would dumpster sound quality.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     So, yeah, I don't understand why there would be a mismatch between the recordings of either EAFR, unless there was something else preventing all signal transmission towards the rear EAFR. The CVR in the rear has been a thing for 80 years now.

  My understanding is that, as you say, the CAM has a preamp. That preamp can be powered by the RIPS that accompanies the forward EAFR.
  <br/>
  In addition, I believe there is a single
  <i>
   analogue
  </i>
  connection from the CAM+preamp to the aft EAFR in addition to the analogue connection from the CAM+preamp to the forward EAFR. I believe, but am not sure,that the other flight-deck audio (headsets) is carried digitally over the fibre-optic network to the aft EAFR. The network may or may not be in operation in the event of an electrical failure: I simply don't know.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The publicly available information I can find is not stunningly clear about this.

The CVR function receives three analog audio crew channels provided by the Flight Deck Audio System and one analog audio channel from the cockpit Area Microphone and Preamplifier (AMP). The cockpit area audio and the three audio crew channels are recorded in both the forward and the aft installed EAFR recorders. The CVR recording duration is two hours minimum.

    Two EAFRs are installed on Boeing 787 aircraft, one forward and one aft. The forward and aft recorders are powered by the left and right 28V DC buses respectively. The forward recorder is equipped with a recorder independent power supply (RIPS) to provide backup power to the recorder for approximately 10 minutes once left DC bus power is lost. Both recorders record the same set of flight data independent of each other.
   </div>
  </div>
  So the forward EAFR is powered from the
  <i>
   left
  </i>
  28V DC bus with the possibility of being powered by the RIPS, and the aft EAFR is powered from the
  <i>
   right
  </i>
  28 V DC bus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  What I have been unable to determine is whether the right and/or left 28 V DC buses are powered from the main battery in case of failure of the AC power supply. To my untrained eye, it looks like the Captain's flight displays are powered from the main battery in extremis (28 V DC - C1), but that there are various circuit breakers, that could be automated, that may or may not allow or prevent other loads (such as the F/O's flight displays (28 V DC - C2), or the aft EAFR, being supplied by the main battery, (See link to diagram). There could well be very drastic automated load shedding.
  <br/>

  </a>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If the
  <i>
   right
  </i>
  28 V DC bus was unpowered for any period, it follows that the aft EAFR was not recording for that period. This would make the forward EAFR important in case of a power failure that prevented the right 28 V DC bus from providing power.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All the information that is unclear to me will be transparently clear to the crash investigators. But it seems to me that the aft EAFR will not hold data for any period that the right 28 V DC bus is not operating. Whether that applies to this incident is an open question.

The network may or may not be in operation in the event of an electrical failure: I simply don't know.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The publicly available information I can find is not stunningly clear about this.

     GE Aviation: Consolidate and increase recording power with the 3254F EAFR. -
     <a href="https://www.geaerospace.com/sites/default/files/enhanced-aircraft-flight-recorder-3254F.pdf" target="_blank">
      https://www.geaerospace.com/sites/de...rder-3254F.pdf
     </a>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     As for power, this NTSB document describes the power set-up for the EAFRs
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <a href="https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket/Document/docBLOB?ID=40431665&amp;FileExtension=.PDF&amp;FileName=Flight%20Data%20Recorder%20Specialist%27s%20Factual%20Report-Master.PDF" target="_blank">
      https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket/Documen...ort-Master.PDF
     </a>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     So the forward EAFR is powered from the
     <i>
      left
     </i>
     28V DC bus with the possibility of being powered by the RIPS, and the aft EAFR is powered from the
     <i>
      right
     </i>
     28 V DC bus.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     What I have been unable to determine is whether the right and/or left 28 V DC buses are powered from the main battery in case of failure of the AC power supply. To my untrained eye, it looks like the Captain's flight displays are powered from the main battery in extremis (28 V DC - C1), but that there are various circuit breakers, that could be automated, that may or may not allow or prevent other loads (such as the F/O's flight displays (28 V DC - C2), or the aft EAFR, being supplied by the main battery, (See link to diagram). There could well be very drastic automated load shedding.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <a href="https://kb.skyhightex.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/ElectricalSystemIndicationandControl-1024x640.png" target="_blank">
      https://kb.skyhightex.com/wp-content...l-1024x640.png
     </a>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     If the
     <i>
      right
     </i>
     28 V DC bus was unpowered for any period, it follows that the aft EAFR was not recording for that period. This would make the forward EAFR important in case of a power failure that prevented the right 28 V DC bus from providing power.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     All the information that is unclear to me will be transparently clear to the crash investigators. But it seems to me that the aft EAFR will not hold data for any period that the right 28 V DC bus is not operating. Whether that applies to this incident is an open question.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I am starting to see the hamsterwheel references now.
  <br/>
  Having two combined recorders is already more backup than what had previously been the norm, in addition theres the independently powered area mic going analog to the front recorder.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The common models I have checked the sheets for also provides a digital output (which is probably sent to the aft recorder via normal busses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Having a seperate analog line going to the aft recorder would be several Kg of extra weight, and probably a substantial amount of loom design and paperwork for what is then a backup to an already redundant system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hence, imho why this signal only goes to the forward recorder. It is already a \xabbonus\xbb.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The power for microphone and preamp is in the &gt;1watt range range, completely insignificant.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I am still interested in reliable information as to what is expected to be on the recorder of an aircraft which has lost the generators, what about the battery powered prinary instruments? Does some systems and the aft recorder come online with the RAT or would everything be down to the one cockpit mic? Surely not?

  I'm pretty sure that the OP of the first quote focused on "

  ". (oops, I see in the meantime that I'm beaten in speed by a considerable margin)

  But even then, if I may borrow part of previous quote:
  <br/>
  <i>

  :
  <br/>
  * I believe blindly that the "
  <i>
   foremost global centres of IT hardware

  " can recover each and every bit on my drowned IPhone and would not hesitate for a second to handover my phone
  <br/>
  * However, I would not trust and/or handover my damaged EAFR to any of those "
  <i>
   centres of IT hardware",
  </i>
  even just to look at it, let alone touch it, until it was proven that the centre in question, has all the approvals, certifications, qualifications, track record and whatever. So, moon landings or not, that does not prove anything.

  One note of QAR data\x97it\x92s transmitted to provide flight data monitoring (.Flight Ops Quality Assurance, in FAA land). The QAR data might help, but it\x92s not transmitted in real time only after block in.

  1. The investigation's reliance on the front RIPS battery backuped EAFR indicates a confirmation of a total electrical power loss;

  Really, Grumpy? If aft EAFR (not RIPS supported) would have had any data/voice after elec failure following T/O, I think the AAIB would have been more than happy to extract everything from that one since it was found earlier and most likely more intact than the front one. Regards

  In keeping with PilotDAR's request, here is some possibly useful information regarding the type of Flight Data Recorder (FDR) and Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) likely installed in the Air India B787 (using long names etc for those who may be unfamiliar with various acronyms).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The B787 was one of the first aircraft to receive a new type of FDR/CVR, known as an Enhanced Airborne Flight Recorder (EAFR). Some detail of the time may be found here:

  discusses more on the 'new' ARINC-767 protocol in use with these later units.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some broader background into ARINC's role in determining the standards applicable to aviation can be seen in this video. While it doesn't specifically cover ARINC-767 (used by the B787 EAFR) the history and associated detail is interesting and may give a little useful background:

  In terms of actual data recovery I had a look around but couldn't find any video that showed this from an EAFR, however this NTSB YT link gives insight into how data was recovered from an earlier FDR unit (mounted in a
  <span style="color:#131313">
   Bombardier CRJ700
  </span>
  ). While it's different to that installed in the 787 the nature of the work and how it's carefully carried out may give some insight.

  I claim no specific knowledge here, just providing references to detail I read while trying to learn more about these newer units.

     I suspect both recorders will contain the same data. Given the radio transmission after the loss of thrust the aircraft still had at least the emergency electrical bus powered. This should have kept both recorders online. It is however possible given the 10 minute battery backup that Boeing chose to put the the recorders on another bus but that\x92s not the norm.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I didn\x92t really find a clear reference for other posts (trying to avoid the hamster wheel to over-rev)  but in general the emergency busses only support equipment needed for survival.
  <br/>
  CVR and FDR, och combined such is not needed for survival.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I would state that in general the CVR/FDR is shedded when on emergency electricity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its clear from earlier posts that the front EAFR have a battery backup for this reason and the aft has not.

     I'm pretty sure that within the 787 data is passed over the serial data protocols to a DFDAU - Digital Flight Data Acquisition Unit where it is stored as a form of database. Quite possibly XML
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I am not aware of any requirement for a DFDAU (or equivalent) to store any data. I say "or equivalent" because in B717 the DFDAU is not an LRU. It is a functional partition of the VIA.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's not clear to me that 787 EAFR even requires an external DFDAU. The GE EAFR does not -

  <br/>
  "Provides Flight Data Acquisition function of ARINC 664 p7 data parameters &ndash; No need for a Digital Flight Data Acquisition Unit (DFDAU)."
