     I've been closely examining a video frame captured very early in the footage depicting the aircraft's final moments. In this particular frame, I believe the
     <b>
      left main landing gear (MLG) door is clearly visible in the open position
     </b>
     , while the
     <b>
      right MLG door appears closed
     </b>
     . Additionally, both
     <b>
      main gear bogies are noticeably tilted forward
     </b>
     \x97 a configuration that typically occurs at the initiation of the gear retraction sequence.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     This combination strongly suggests that a
     <b>
      gear retraction was commanded
     </b>
     , but the
     <b>
      sequence was interrupted and never completed
     </b>
     . What\x92s particularly striking is the
     <b>
      asymmetry
     </b>
     \x97 the left door open, the right door closed \x97 which should not occur during normal operations and points toward a possible
     <b>
      hydraulic failure scenario
     </b>
     during retraction.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     As many will know, on the Boeing 787-8,
     <b>
      each main gear door is hydraulically actuated and powered by its respective side\x92s hydraulic system
     </b>
     \x97 the
     <b>
      left gear door by the left hydraulic system
     </b>
     , and the
     <b>
      right by the right
     </b>
     . This leads me to propose the following hypothesis:
     <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
      <li>
       Shortly after rotation, with a positive rate of climb established, the
       <b>
        flight crew commands gear up
       </b>
       .
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       The
       <b>
        gear retraction sequence initiates
       </b>
       ; the
       <b>
        main gear bogies tilt forward
       </b>
       , consistent with the start of retraction.
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       <b>
        The right engine fails first
       </b>
       , resulting in a
       <b>
        loss of right hydraulic system pressure
       </b>
       . Consequently, the
       <b>
        right MLG door does not open
       </b>
       .
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       The
       <b>
        left MLG door, still powered by the left hydraulic system, opens
       </b>
       .
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       <b>
        Moments later, the left engine also fails
       </b>
       , leading to
       <b>
        loss of the left hydraulic system
       </b>
       . With the door now open but no remaining hydraulic pressure,
       <b>
        the left main gear remains extended and the door remains open
       </b>
       .
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       The
       <b>
        ram air turbine (RAT) deploys
       </b>
       , consistent with total engine and electrical power loss.
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       With the
       <b>
        loss of thrust from both engines
       </b>
       , the aircraft loses lift and enters an unrecoverable descent, tragically ending in impact.
       <br/>
      </li>
     </ol>
     This sequence would explain the
     <b>
      partially completed gear retraction
     </b>
     and the
     <b>
      asymmetric gear door position
     </b>
     observed in the video evidence. It\x92s worth noting that the timing of the hydraulic losses would have to be
     <b>
      very close together
     </b>
     \x97 potentially within seconds \x97 which aligns with a
     <b>
      dual engine failure shortly after take-off
     </b>
     . In such a scenario,
     <b>
      asymmetric thrust would be minimal or non-existent
     </b>
     , making the aircraft\x92s attitude appear otherwise stable in its descent.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Further supporting this theory are:
     <ul>
      <li>
       <b>
        Eyewitness reports of a loud bang
       </b>
       , possibly indicating an engine failure.
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       A
       <b>
        mayday call
       </b>
       reportedly made by the crew.
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       The
       <b>
        audible presence of the RAT
       </b>
       in the video, suggesting a complete loss of engine-driven electrical and hydraulic systems.
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       The
       <b>
        noticeable absence of typical engine noise
       </b>
       , supporting the hypothesis of dual engine failure.
       <br/>
      </li>
     </ul>
     This scenario would offer a tragically plausible explanation for the aircraft\x92s behavior and the observed configuration in its final moments. Of course, the
     <b>
      official investigation will provide the definitive answers
     </b>
     , and we must await their findings.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     In the meantime, my thoughts are very much with all those affected by this heartbreaking event.

     Unfortunately this is my first post here. I wanted to upload the frame for all to see but the forum is restricting me from doing this until I reach 8 posts. I can't link to it via a URL either. I studied a frame from the very start of the video, just as the full aircraft enters view and expanded it by 400% allowing me to see the position of the MLG doors).
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I have no knowledge about 787, but every landing gear system I\x92ve worked with did not sequence Left and Right MLG to retract and extend with each other. In fact it is typical for left and right side to move at slightly different speed due to different friction etc. Retraction assymmetry is probably not a clue to this mystery.

     I would say an average passenger has problems differentiating between thrust and G.
     <br/>
     Even after engines lost all power G could still vary quite a bit as the pilots tried to crash with as little energy as possible. Any passenger could feel this varying G as varying thrust instead.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  it is also not impossible that a relight/restart (automatic/manual) was performed and at least one engine started again to produce thrust before the then inevitable impact.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It\x92s a known path that removing fuel from the jet engines will lead to (momentarily) loss of main electric power (if the APU is not runing). It\x92s a less speculated (and a less likely) area that what path might lead to loss of engine thust if main electric power is lost?

     Hmm. Not sure where the idea comes from the gear was partially retracted... I can't see any signs for it on the video, nor can I see a RAT. and just to say "some event" must have happened is not very helpful, is it? Of course "something" has happened, but the question remains what.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Would it not make more sense to assume there is no RAT if no RAT is visible?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Could it be that we as pilots are in general biased to find a technical reason, although we all know the vast majority of accidents are down to human error?
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  it\x92s easy to explain that a small feature is not shown on a single frame of a low quality video when there are also frames where something can be seen where the RAT should be. It\x92s much harder to explain the RAT-like sound clearly audible though the whole video. My money is on that the RAT was out, but it\x92s not a fact.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Deployed RAT doesn\x92t rule out pilot error, so no bias there.

     It was hard to let it go, so I spent a bit more time with the audio, using filtering and matching to see if I could be even more sure.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     It's a pity uploading audio to this site isn't as easy as uploading photos, but I can say it took very little filtering and matching to make the Air India audio become nearly indistinguishable from audio taken of B787 with known RAT extended during landing.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I can't see it in the photos either, but in these circumstances the audio is a lot more trustworthy, and from my audio point of view RAT deployment is 100% confirmed.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     In the off chance that the audio I borrowed from a confirmed RAT event was somehow faked, I plotted the technical data I could find of the B787 RAT (4000rpm, 2 blades) combined with a height estimate and asked the O3 model with deep research to estimate doppler shift and speed.
     <br/>
     The result matches the above documented 270-200Hz (in one of the harmonics) Doppler shift observed in 1.7 seconds.
    </div>

  Would it be possible to determine from the video audio wheter the

  fan noise (RPM) maches with a normal take off? I know that\x92s a long shot and I\x92m already very impressed by your work, thank you for sharing it.

     Woulda shoulda coulda and might not have changed this particular outcome, but is there a case in taking off with APU ON? It would give some level of redundancy for electrics and hydraulics and perhaps avoid the added shock and workload of losing thrust, electrics and hydraulics pretty much simultaneously in a rare scenario like this one. During Hudson river accident, APU ON was the first thing Sully did (apart from saying \x91my aircraft\x92) but he had more altitude and speed and electrics and the gear up. I know there are other considerations for using or not using APU depending on flight phase, but if it is safe and within design parameters, perhaps SOPs should give pilots discretion on whether or not they use the APU for critical flight phases? Just a thought.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Yes, in one in a million (billion?) cases. If every take off and landing would be with the APU runing, there would be [some small number] of cases where the APU would shutdown at the critical moment causing electrics to reconfigure or the APU could shed a blade or catch a fire. Those events should not cause an accident, but then aircraft shouldn\x92t just fall out of the sky 30 seconds after lift off.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Furthernore mandating use of the APU would be quite hyppocratic, if reduced thrust take-offs, single engine taxi outs, landing with less than maximum available flap or other cost saving measures were still allowed.

  Almost all catastrophic accidents that are not deliberately initiated require multiple causes. It&rsquo;s extremely unlikely that both engine condition switches or fire switches were accidentaly actuated during a routine rotation and initial climb. However it&rsquo;s stil possible that the crew did actuate those switches (intentionally or unintentionally) in response to some anomaly experienced at that time. Thus it&rsquo;s not impossible that electrical system malfunction was the first link in a sequence that led to removing the fuel supply to both engines. The most obvious one is that crew thought that they had dual engine failure due to lost of main electrical power and initiated a double engine restart bycling the engine condition levers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The purpose of this post is not to promote the above as a possible cause of the accident, but to remaind people that a (proven) mechanical fault does not rule out pilot error and vice versa.

      What if the PF called stop just before V1 and closed the thrust levers but either changed his mind or was overridden by the other pilot, who rapidly pushed the thrust levers back up. Could this trigger a TCMA intervention and subsequent dual engine shutdown as it was still on the runway at this point? Hopefully not.

  This is the best theory of TCMA activation so far, but it\x92s still very remote. In this theory there is no need for a TCMA anomaly, it needs only(!) two simultaneous engine anonalies (and sn improper crew action) that would trigger the TCMA as designed. If there are safeguards preventing this happening, they are not mentioned in this thread.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also doesn\x92t explaine the ADS-B data showing acceleration after lift off.

     a slight more precise translation as a native speaker. \x93After take off it felt as if we were still in one place &amp; not moving. Then the sound of the engines racing (common Indian term for revving of engines on bikes &amp; cars with the clutch depressed) &amp; then green &amp; white lights came on in the cabin as we hit something.\x94 In my opinion the race sound he talking about sounds like engine surges if compared to race.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Thank you for the translation, it was badly needed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Engine surge is heard as series of lound bangs or fainter popping sounds. Engine RPM is not increasing during a surge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One source of a revving sound could be the RAT revving up. However it doesn\x92t match the timeline of the (potentially unreliable) witness report. Emergnecy lights and RAT are both activated by loss of main electric power. I would assume that the lights come on instantly and the RAT take some time to deploy before revving up.

     Could it be possible that in the software the 'position-eng-fuel-switch-left' =ON and the 'position-eng-fuel-switch-right=ON' can both changed to OFF by a electric/software issue? So without movement of the actual physical switches the system senses a shutdown command?

  There have been many speculations about latent threats in systems\x92 design. If you can easiliy come up with some possible latent threat, what are the changes that not a one professional person designing, testing and certifying it couldn\x92t figure it out? Or it was ignore if recognised?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Without any 787 knowledge, I would assume two discreet signals from respective Engine Fuel Switch to each FADEC channel, possibly with other redundancies. Or other solution that is at least as robust.

     ?
     <br/>
     Perhaps the safer solution should be an additional circuitry micro-switch feed of all three "up and locked"? (that agrees with the gear-handle).
     <br/>
     Also waiting to hear what the 787-8 RADALT status is? Was it ever 5G emanations-proofed?
     <br/>
     Is there any software provision for the TCMA to know for sure that the gear is neither up nor down? I would doubt it. Does that uncertainty affect the thrust-lever's positional input?
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  If the 787 is not different to all other aircaft, the WoW senses and putouts only one parameter that is always 1 or 0. There is no netherlands in between. The physical motion the switch is sensing migh have not reach it other end at the time the switch changes its output, but it is irrevelant. If there is a requirement to know that the motion has reaches it\x92s other end, another switch (or other type of sensor) is needed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Using up and locked as signal to prevent TCMA activation is obviously more dangerous as it allows TCMA to function while the aircraft is in the air.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Even in the same aircraft there might be different logics to determin if the aicraft is on the ground or in the air, depending what is the priority. Is the priority to know that the aircraft is in the air or on the ground or even NOT in the air. Some of those logics could use up-and-locked sensors and the gear handle position.

     Hi all,
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Disclaimer: I read this thread from hour 1, still scratching my head regarding perf though.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I know sound analysis points to higher odds being a dual engine failure with RAT deployed, however I still have some questions if anyone is available to enlighten.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     So, my questions is related to T/O performance.
     <br/>
     <br/>

     Is it possible on the 787 to calculate perf in the OPT for F15/20 T/O, and to enter F5 T/O speed on the FMC ?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     By that I mean do normal procedure, but at the point where you are suppose to enter flaps, CG speed ect\x85. You, out of habit (if F5 is indeed a habit on the 787) enter F5, but F15/20 speeds ? Or would there be a warning that you have manually inputed speeds that are not correct for the selected flaps and conditions inputed in the FMC ?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Thanks for the help !

  An FCOM available in the net says that the FMC doesn\x92t accept Vr entry lower than Vr min or V1 min.

     \x93The "requirement" for TCMA was "specified" by the FAA. Manufacturers seeking certification of aeronautical products subject to the requirements then had no choice but to design and instal systems that met the FAA's certification requirements\x94.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I think that has already been established upthread.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     \x93I'm pretty sure it's clear what "sources", other than TCMA systems if any, have "authority to issue an engine shutdown command", though it does depend on what you mean by "engine shutdown".\x94
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I don\x92t think that is clear at all. The shutdown hypothesis, if true, both engines, makes it likely that they were commanded to do so. While the discussion has centered around the TCMA subsystem, if other subsystems have the ability to do that, they need to be defined and looked at as well.
    </div>

  There\x92s at least N2 overspeed protection that actually uses the same hardware as TCMA to stop the noise. There might exists crosstalk and inhibit for the N2 overspeed protection if the N2 overspeed protection has shut down the other engine. In fact it\x92s not confirmed that no such crosstalk exists in 787 TCMA system. It would complie with \x94no single fault should cause\x85\x94 certification requirements. Other than that I see no practical difference in the propability of TCMA and N2 overspeed protection to shut down both engine during take-off.

     Thanks for that. That begs the question, if there is overspead protection already, perhaps multiple channels and sensors, why is TCMA needed at all ?. Blanket overspeed protection already covers the underlying requirement, ie: prevention of overspeed, all cases. Seems to be adding complexity for no reason.
    </div>

  TCMA is there to prevent higher than commanded thrust while on the ground in purpose to ascertain expected deceleration. N2 overspeed protection is a much older concept from the days before FADECs to prevent overspeeding engine disintegrsting and potentially causing lots of damage to the aircraft. In a GE engined 787 the N2 overpeed protection, while operating as designed, first try to lower the N2 and only if that fails it will shut down the engine.

     Hmmmmm\x85.then I wonder how the auto throttles will behave if a low stop height if the MCP is mis set \x97 potentially below 400\x92 AGL. Will they stay in hold, will they go to SPD, or will they engage in THR REF.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I never tried this in the sim on the 777 so I\x92m not sure. I was grateful that the 777 would change to SPD mode on initial altitude capture (as opposed to the -400 VMo here we go). It\x92s been a few years in any case though.
