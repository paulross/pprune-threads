  Non-aviation engineer here: I have a question about the low level altitude capture theory that I've been a bit hesitant to ask, since no-one else seemed to be bringing it up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  My understanding of altitude capture is that the autopilot will automatically adjust
  <i>
   both
  </i>
  thrust
  <i>
   and pitch
  </i>
  to intercept the requested altitude. However to my eyes there is very little pitch adjustment in the CCTV video of the plane taken from behind, until the very end of the video when it pitches up somewhat (obscured by buildings, more visible in the smartphone video). Please correct me if I'm wrong but I'd have thought that if the autopilot was trying to capture a very low altitude it would start pitching down (quite noticeably!) to do so, not remain at what looks like 10+ degrees nose-up. I honestly struggle to reconcile what I'm looking at in the video with an attempt to level off at 0ft, 200ft, or any of the other mentioned low-level altitudes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also maybe I'm missing something 787-specific but generally doesn't the autopilot have to be activated for the aircraft to automatically attempt to capture the pre-selected altitude? That was the case in this incident involving a Dash 8 and a target altitude of 0 feet that I am reading about (
  <a href="https://www.gov.uk/aaib-reports/aaib-investigation-to-dhc-8-402-dash-8-g-ecoe" target="_blank">
   https://www.gov.uk/aaib-reports/aaib...-dash-8-g-ecoe
  </a>
  ). I'd have thought the PF would still be hand-flying the departure at the point that things went wrong, considering that the gear hadn't even been retracted yet...

     I too watched his explanation with interest. However I believe he is not considering the possibility of C hydraulics failure prior to wheels lift-off, because I speculated this is the more likely reason the gear trucks remained in a forward tilt position,

      see my earlier post here
     </a>
     . I believe the crew never got as far as calling for the Gear Up... many possible reasons for this, flickering instrument screens during the electrical switchover to battery power, flurry of EICAS messages. For any of those things happening around time of rotation, I would be advocating delaying gear up decision until safely climbing away above AA and as a crew you have chance to discuss safest course of action. Not putting the gear up shouldn't kill you.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Point is the gear truck tilt is a clue of a C hydraulics failure, but we cant determine if hydraulics failed prior to wheels off runway or prior to gear doors opening in retraction sequence.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Presumably the RAT was deployed (with an "humungous" bang) when the residual pressure in the "C" hydraulic system decayed to zero: there was initially enough to tilt the trucks but thats it.

  Loss of only C hydraulics is not enough to auto deploy the RAT.

     Thank god someone has pointed out the absolute cobblers some people who claim to have some experience of this type (and other completely unrelated types) have been spouting. And if anyone else wants to erroneously compare the 757/767 low level EPR ALT CAP scenario , that keeps the TO thrust on, it doesn\x92t reduce it! This is truely one of the worst of these accidents threads I\x92ve read in a long time, I pity the mods.
    </div>

  </div>
  100%. As pointed out many times, this accident just doesn\x92t fit with either performance errors, flap/gear mis-selection or inappropriate AP/AT modes. The flightpath was as expected until shortly after liftoff, then we see/hear RAT deployment and an unpowered descent into the ground. There are still plenty of possible reasons as to why this occurred but to date we can\x92t really narrow it down any more.

  <br/>
  What for? It could possibly reveal some abstract relationship flaw between microswitches, RadAlts, and/or even shock-strut extension or travelling gear or door position that allows for an effect dependent upon the high ambient temperature-dictated interrelationship?
  <br/>
  Why ferret thusly? Many latent gremlins reside in complex circuitry. It is very hard to get away from the logical proposition that gear selection / travel (or possibly the earlier G/A transition) predicated the double flame-out and RAT deployment. The 787 was always ever described as an electric airplane and I see that as a harbinger - not of doom, but of inspiration.
  <br/>
  I personally have never trusted electro-mechanical devices such as micro-switches... or for that matter, solenoid-operated relays. Or travelling further afield, those fiendish devices called circuit-breakers (thermal or otherwise). And a description of an RCD as a "safety switch" sends a shiver up my spine. They are really just a potential annoyance and an ongoing expense. As I have found again and again, their reliability and test functions are no guarantee of serviceability. A ceiling fire cured me of that fantasy.

    You might also reflect deeply upon the following observation:
   </i>
  </b>
  <br/>
  From the outset, this electric airplane had electrical issues. The Lithium Ion battery fires were never really resolved. They just re-housed it in a very stout titanium box - one that can only breathe a fiery breath overboard I believe... as if it was a slice of thorium always threatening to turn into lethal plutonium. The 787 designers convinced the regulator that their electric airplane could only become an industry steed if it had the power of such a battery. Unsure whether there's since been any ongoing issues (or if there had been, would it become a "known" event - now that this malignant potency has been robustly "contained"?). So what happens when a fire breaks out inside that titanium box and all its volts are discharged overboard? Are any battery-powered holding relays released at that point? i.e. is there a damning catch? Pandora's stout box may prove to be a gift-horse.

     Any indication from known videos as to what height the RAT comes on, around 400' AGL, or well before reaching 400' ?

  I haven't seen any videos, or heard of any, that might tell us when the RAT deployed.  It was definitely below 400' AGL, because the airplane never got that high.

     Dunno, the discussion around the switch as a failure point looks spurious to me. With that used to support the idea that a possible engine shutdown was due to the master fuel valve closing.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I don\x92t really buy that, since we don\x92t know at this stage whether the engines did in fact fully shutdown, or were commanded to spool down to idle, or other lower thrust setting, both of which would produce the same result. Thoughts ?.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  If we accept that the RAT was deployed, then my understanding is that this would only occur if both engines were fully shutdown, not just reduced thrust or idle.

  I have read most of the thread (old and new). As a lawyer working in forensic investigations, I am constantly involved in problem-solving. My field of work also includes complex investigations related to insolvencies, which almost always require an analysis of the causes behind a specific, established outcome. In doing so, I naturally also have to deal with probabilities. However, it often turns out that the most likely or plausible explanation does not reflect what actually happened.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many of the considerations I&rsquo;ve read fail because the simultaneous failure of both engines is extremely unlikely, leading to a constant search for higher-order causes. It was suggested that an incorrect altitude setting led to an early thrust reduction. However, this would not explain the deployment of the RAT (Ram Air Turbine), especially since the thrust could have been readjusted. FADEC and TCAM are highly redundant systems, and TCAM failure is unlikely due to WOW (Weight on Wheels) logic, making a simultaneous engine failure after VR equally improbable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With that said, and with regard to my question concerning the AD that relates to the fuel control switches (FCS), my thought&mdash;and it was nothing more than that&mdash;was that their activation becomes more probable if it can occur accidentally. That&rsquo;s how I came across SAIB: NM-18-33.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another user then brought up an iPhone. That notion would, of course, be dramatic&mdash;but how unlikely is it really that after approximately 10,000 actuations between December 2013 and June 2025, the two FCS no longer lock perfectly? Considering all of this, I find it quite conceivable that the A/T slightly reduced thrust in the first seconds after VR (e.g., if an incorrect target altitude had been entered) and that an object lying between the thrust levers and the FCS could have pushed the FCS into the &ldquo;Off&rdquo; position. Due to the buttons on top of the switches, which provide some resistance, it&rsquo;s even possible that the object both pulled and pushed them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But all of this is speculation. The investigation report will bring clarity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Even if my theory is not confirmed, I still believe that the positioning and mechanism of the FCS are suboptimal. Switches of such critical importance should be better protected, and movements in the area in front of the switches (like reducing thrust) should not follow the same direction as shutting off the fuel supply. A different switching direction alone would provide more safety&mdash;especially considering that the FCS are protected laterally by metal plates.

That notion would, of course, be dramatic\x97but how unlikely is it really that after approximately 10,000 actuations between December 2013 and June 2025, the two FCS no longer lock perfectly? Considering all of this, I find it quite conceivable that the A/T slightly reduced thrust in the first seconds after VR (e.g., if an incorrect target altitude had been entered) and that an object lying between the thrust levers and the FCS could have pushed the FCS into the \x93Off\x94 position. Due to the buttons on top of the switches, which provide some resistance, it\x92s even possible that the object both pulled and pushed them.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     But all of this is speculation. The investigation report will bring clarity.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Even if my theory is not confirmed, I still believe that the positioning and mechanism of the FCS are suboptimal. Switches of such critical importance should be better protected, and movements in the area in front of the switches (like reducing thrust) should not follow the same direction as shutting off the fuel supply. A different switching direction alone would provide more safety\x97especially considering that the FCS are protected laterally by metal plates.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  It is probable that the switches are becoming easier to move across the gate after 10,000 operations.  Something falling on them would be a possibility to cause that.  And there is certainly an argument to be had whether down=on is a safer way for them to operate.

     OK, I promised some
     <b>
      <span style="color:#c0392b">
       informed speculation
      </span>
     </b>
     when I got back, so here goes:
     <br/>
     Disclaimer: never worked the 787, so my detailed knowledge is a bit lacking.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     First off, this is perplexing - especially if the RAT was deployed. There is no 'simple' explanation that I can come up with.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     GEnx-1B engines have been exceptionally reliable, and the GE carbon composite fan blades are
     <i>
      very
     </i>
     robust and resistant to bird strike damage (about 15 years after the GE90 entry into service, I remember a GE boast that no GE90 (carbon composite) fan blades had needed to be scrapped due to damage (birdstrike, FOD, etc. - now that was roughly another 15 years ago, so is probably no longer true, but it shows just how robust the carbon composite blades are - far better than the more conventional titanium fan blades).
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Not saying it wasn't somehow birdstrike related, just that is very unlikely (then again, all the other explanations I can come up with are also very unlikely
     <img alt="" border="0" class="inlineimg" src="https://www.pprune.org/images/smilies2/icon_rolleyes.gif" title="Roll Eyes (Sarcastic)"/>
     ).
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Using improper temp when calculating TO performance - after some near misses, Boeing added logic that cross-compares multiple total temp probes - aircraft TAT (I think the 787 uses a single, dual element probe for aircraft TAT, but stand to be corrected) and the temp measured by the engine inlet probes - and puts up a message if they disagree by more than a few degree tolerance - so very, very unlikely.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     N1 power setting is somewhat less prone to measurement and power setting errors than EPR (N1 is a much simpler measurement than Rolls EPR) - although even with EPR, problems on both engines at the same time is almost unheard of.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The Auto Thrust (autothrottle) function 'falls asleep' at 60 knots - and doesn't unlock until one of several things happens - 250 knots, a set altitude AGL is exceeded (I'm thinking 3,000 ft. but the memory is fuzzy), thrust levers are moved more than a couple of degrees, or the mode select is changed (memory says that last one is inhibited below 400 ft. AGL). So an Auto Thrust malfunction is also extremely unlikely. Further, a premature thrust lever retard would not explain a RAT deployment.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     TO does seem to be very late in the takeoff role - even with a big derate, you still must accelerate fast enough to reach V1 with enough runway to stop - so there is still considerable margin if both engines are operating normally. That makes me wonder if they had the correct TO power setting - but I'm at a loss to explain how they could have fouled that up with all the protections that the 787 puts on that.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     If one engine did fail after V1, it's conceivable that they shut down the wrong engine - but since this happened literally seconds after takeoff, it begs the question why they would be in a big hurry to shut down the engine. Short of an engine fire, there is nothing about an engine failure that requires quick action to shut it down - no evidence of an engine fire, and even with an engine fire, you normally have minutes to take action - not seconds.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <span style="color:#c0392b">
      <b>
       The one thing I keep thinking about is someone placing both fuel switches to cutoff immediately after TO.
      </b>
     </span>
     Yes, it's happened before (twice - 767s in the early 1980s), but the root causes of that mistake are understood and have been corrected. Hard to explain how it could happen (
     <b>
      <span style="color:#c0392b">
       unless, God forbid, it was intentional
      </span>
     </b>
     ).
    </div>

  I think it's not a coincidence that
  <a href="https://www.pprune.org/accidents-close-calls/666581-air-india-ahmedabad-accident-12th-june-2025-part-2-a.html#post11903414" target="_blank">

     Commanded engine cutoff - the aisle stand fuel switch sends electrical signals to the spar valve and the "High Pressure Shutoff Valve" (HPSOV) in the Fuel Metering Unit, commanding them to open/close using aircraft power. The HPSOV is solenoid controlled, and near instantaneous. The solenoid is of a 'locking' type that needs to be powered both ways (for obvious reasons, you wouldn't want a loss of electrical power to shut down the engine). The fire handle does the same thing, via different electrical paths (i.e. separate wiring).
     <br/>
     <br/>
     As I've noted previously, a complete loss of aircraft electrical power would not cause the engines to flameout (or even lose meaningful thrust) during takeoff. In the takeoff altitude envelope, 'suction feed' (I think Airbus calls it 'gravity feed') is more than sufficient to supply the engine driven fuel pumps. It's only when you get up to ~20k ft. that suction feed can become an issue - and this event happened near sea level.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Not matter what's happening on the aircraft side - pushing the thrust levers to the forward stop will give you (at least) rated takeoff power since the only thing required from the aircraft is fuel and thrust lever position (and the thrust lever position resolver is powered by the FADEC).
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The TCMA logic is designed and scrubbed so as to be quite robust - flight test data of the engine response to throttle slams is reviewed to insure there is adequate margin between the TCMA limits and the actual engine responses to prevent improper TCMA activation. Again, never say never, but a whole lot would have had to go wrong in the TCMA logic for it to have activated on this flight.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Now, if I assume the speculation that the RAT deployed is correct, I keep coming up with two potential scenarios that could explain what's known regarding this accident:
     <br/>
     1) TCMA activation shutdown the engines
     <br/>
     or
     <br/>
     2) The fuel cutoff switches were activated.
     <br/>
     I literally can come up with no other plausible scenarios.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     In all due respect to all the pilots on this forum, I really hope it wasn't TCMA. It wouldn't be the first time a mandated 'safety system' has caused an accident (it wouldn't just be Boeing and GE - TCMA was forced by the FAA and EASA to prevent a scenario that had never caused a fatal accident) - and there would be a lot embarrassing questions for all involved. But I personally know many of the people who created, validated, and certified the GEnx-1B TCMA logic - and can't imagine what they would be going through if they missed something (coincidentally, one of them was at my birthday party last weekend and inevitably we ended up talking about what we used to do at Boeing (he's also retired)). Worse, similar TCMA logic is on the GEnx-2B (747-8) - which I was personally responsible for certifying - as well as the GE90-115B and the 737 MAX Leap engine - the consequences of that logic causing this accident would be massive.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I\x92m sure this is wrong; was looking for confirmation. I read somewhere that the 787 keeps the fuel valve open by an electric driven actuator, and closes it by spring force.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I seem to remember Fred Dibner talking about how railway cars brake by draining the piston not by pressurising it, so trains will stop when supply lines break.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The electrical system updates to 787s for ADs and SBs - do any of these include software updates? For example the integer overflow causing GCU failsafe rectified under AD 2018-20-15. If so, who is writing and implementing these software updates? The original engineers? Their apprentices who had years long handovers? Or have they been outsourced and offshored? When these updates occur, does the entire system get tested and ratified or just the bit the bug fix is meant to fix? Because I\x92ve seen new bugs introduced by bug fixes in areas seemingly nothing to do with the original problem.

  slf/ppl here - with a respectable amount of experience in software delivery for real-time/embedded/safety critical systems. Software development in this area really is an engineering discipline and bears no resemblance to common practice in other areas. Couple that with the requirements for function duplication/triplication, harness separation et al then IMHO the chances of FADEC etc software errors are effectively zero.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I'm commenting to make that point but also to link the videos and the FR-24 dataset - (below with my deltas for height/time added)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <img alt="" class="post_inline_image" src="https://cimg8.ibsrv.net/gimg/pprune.org-vbulletin/925x253/ai_171_fr24_b126bd313caffdd4c8285365be7bc89d5fc355ef.png"/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <i>
   Extract from FR24 csv dataset
  </i>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As noted in both threads to date everything was normal until it wasn't - the two values for fpm above are subject to FR24 variance of +/- 25' so even these suggest a normal climb at this stage of flight ca 2,000fpm. FR24 Lat/Longs all follow the centre line.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On this data the climb stops at around 70' AGL and electrical failure around 2s later. Again, as noted in the threads, this aligns with when gear up might have been expected. If the climb stopped because of fuel shutoff then 2s for spool down to electrical failure isn't out of the question.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Looking at the two videos.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CCTV video indicates a total flight time, from rotation, of about 32s, subjectively levelling off ~14s after rotation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rooftop video has a flight time ~14s suggesting the video starts ~18s after rotation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rooftop video evidences the RAT as deployed from the beginning - meaning it must have been deployed by at least 16s after rotation - which aligns with the ADS-B indicated electrical failure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If the forward flight recorder really is being sent to the US for recovery then it's reasonable to assume that the rear recorder contains nothing after the electrical failure and they are hoping the forward recorder captured something from the cockpit in the final 16s.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I don't have any experience of flight deck CRM but I don't see how those timings allow problem identification/misidentification and subsequent action - ie it wasn't down to the crew.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The maximum aircraft height in the CCTV video, as judged by wingspan, appears higher than 71' - though it is certainly less than a wingspan height at the beginning of the rooftop video.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I haven't seen, in the threads, any statement of what happens on the flight deck with a total electrical failure - is it a 4s blackout whilst the RAT deploys and systems restart? - or are there batteries that keep something alive?

  What I cannot do is add new theories or uncover any new facts the actual experts have not already thought of. However, since summarizing and structuring information is one thing lawyers tend to regularly do (and sometimes even do well), here is my attempt at a useful contribution to this thread: an attempt to summarize the main theories discussed here since day one (which I think hasn't been done for quite some time) in the hope that a birds-eye view will be helpful to those who have not read everything since the beginning or might even trigger some new flash of inspiration for someone more knowledgable than me. I have focused on the cons since there does not seem to be enough evidence to come to any positive conclusion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I shall try to be concise and to refrain from personal evaluations of my own. Of course, no disrespect whatsoever is intended towards all those who have contributed to this thread and to the individual theories, one or combinations of which may turn out to have led to this tragic outcome. That arguments can be made against every single theory that has been propagated seems to be the result of the highly improbable and unusual nature of this deplorable event and certainly not due to any lack of knowledge or reasoning skills in this forum.

    the fact that with two working engines an inadvertent flap retraction should easily be recoverable, even with gear down;
   </li>
   <li>
    strong indications that hydraulic and electric power were lost (audible/visible indications of RAT extension, survivor statement, lack of engine noise, position of MLG bogies).
   </li>
  </ul>
  <span style="color:black">
   For a while, the forward tilt of the bogies as first part of the retraction cycle was seen as additional evidence that the gear had been selected up. However, it has been pointed out that the forward tilt and the opening of the gear doors occur almost simultaneously so that it seems unlikely that hydraulic power was lost in the split second between bogie tilt and gear door actuation. It is now assumed the forward tilt of the bogies was merely a consequence of the hydraulic power loss.

   It should be pointed out that the question of "RAT in or out" was for a while the most contentious in this thread.

  Therefore the crew could have manually deployed it... (there's a button for that). If I saw the engines winding down and couldn't be sure that they would stop at idle, I'd be inclined to deploy the RAT instead of waiting for airplane to do it.

  In flight time they had, deploying the RAT would have about number 10 on the list of things to do.  I doubt the RAT would have been a thought.  I\x92ve flown 5 types with RATs, slathers of sim sessions where the RAT eventually deployed, not once think of it.  It\x92s automatic for reason\x97pilots aren\x92t normally going to reach for it.
