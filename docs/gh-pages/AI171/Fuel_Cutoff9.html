     There is a lot of grasping at straws in this thread. It seems pretty simple to me and only one explanation that fits the evidence. About three seconds after takeoff the Captain noted the FO turn of the fuel cutoff switches. He immediately questioned that for obvious reasons and the FO replied he did not again for reasons that seem obvious to me. He did not want it on the tape and he wanted to delay the Captain in trying to switch them back on. Had the fuel cutoff switches been restored immediately before the engines unspooled the accident would have been avoided. In addition the timing of the cutoff switches movement is exactly what you would expect if the copilot was using one hand trying to be discreet in his actions.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  So, under this scenario an 8,000+ hour PIC on type watches the FO select the Fuel Cut-off switches to Cut-off a couple of hundred feet off the ground, and rather than immediately resetting the switches to Run, he has a short Q&amp;A with the FO, and waits a full 10 seconds before taking any remedial action.

  Where on Earth do you guys get the understanding the FO moved the switches? The FO is PF. His hands are on the yoke. Likely both of them.

  In any case, I smell a rat.

      This might have been discussed but as has been suggested upthread; a possible scenario is that at some point, PIC took their hands off the thrust levers and/or placed them in a guarding position behind the thrust levers at their base - but by doing so unfortunately nudged the Fuel cut-off switches to 'Off' - perhaps 'helped' by there either being incorrectly fitted locking mechanisms or worn locking mechanisms ?

      On this flight, the relative drop in noise and calm that follows the landing gear doors closing after the gear retracts during the initial climb, might have caused an action slip by PIC to perform the engine shut-down procedure used when parking on stand.

  Come on! The gear never moved! You're an Airbus pilot; do you really think that could happen? If so, would the captain then sit there fat, dumb and happy wondering what was now going on... for 10 seconds? Even I would say "Sh1t" and whip those fuel switches back on quicker than the FO could say "WTF!".

  I would suspect that if intentional the pilot who shut the engines down would guard the switches until he was sure the desired result was obtained. There would also be an extreme startle factor in this case. If I saw the PM hands in that area I also would not have immediately questioned that until I observed the engines spooling down.

      Was the RAT deployed manually?

     The report says,

      <i>
       As per the EAFR data both engines N2 values passed below minimum idle speed, and the

     This was 5 seconds after the fuel was cut off.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     It suggests to me that the RAT deployment was initiated while the engines were still above idle and generating electrical power. Obviously one of the pilots could have done it via depressing the switch, as it's a "dual engine failure/stall" memory item (see
     <a href="https://www.pprune.org/accidents-close-calls/666581-air-india-ahmedabad-accident-12th-june-2025-part-2-a-70.html#post11918946" target="_blank">

     ) that won't hurt anything.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Is there a way for the RAT to deploy while the engines are still above idle?
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Loss of hydraulics or electrics will auto deploy the rat. The timing to me however seems to match up with when the engines were selected off.

  If the thrust levers were found in idle but, according to the EAFR, were set to TO thrust until the end, doesn\x92t that also raise further questions? I mean: Of course, the impact causes compression at the nose, but the centrifugal forces act in the opposite direction. So, if there is an objective inconsistency here, and we have a pilot who says he did not operate the fuel cut-off switches, while the EAFR indicates otherwise, then we have yet another inconsistency.

  All we know is the fuel cut off switches were flipped to Cutoff for 10 seconds and then to run again. Not how or by what. The focus should be on how this could occur. Accidentally, technical malfunction, a foreign object somehow hitting and moving them or other reason?
