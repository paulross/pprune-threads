     There has been discussion recently about a procedure that involves moving the fuel switches to CUTOFF and then back to RUN following a dual engine failure.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Attached is an image of a page from the Air India 787 Training Manual that discusses this procedure.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I am submitting this without comment or opinion.
     <br/>
     <br/>

   </div>
  </div>
  Nobody seems to have discussed this.  If I'm reading it right (and I'm not a pilot), it seems to be suggesting that in the event of a dual engine failure, a restart should be attempted while the engine still has high RPM?  It also seems to be indicating that fuel switch resetting should be attempted if the restart has failed to start the engine?

     Notwithstanding what it says in the B787 FCOM and FCTM, I don't think Boeing ever envisaged the dual engine failure procedure being required 10 seconds after rotate.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I think the correct Boeing reply would be: "it is not part of the certification process". So yes, loss of thrust on both engines during the takeoff phase is not really countered for in the procedures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That does not mean that the pilots "out of habit" would have reverted to the procedure. Who would not? But in that case, the fuel control switches would be found in the RUN position post crash (if anything was left). So did they find the switches in the cutoff position, or did the action of switching got "stored" somewhere in FDM (not a specialist on these things, only to hear many times in the past that "maintenance is already aware" if we had an issue and called maintenance post flight)

  With the recent (albeit unofficial) indications that both engine fuel control switches were found in the CUTOFF position, I wonder if it's time to reassess the tone and meaning of Captain Sabharwal's final transmission (perhaps translated from Hindi) &ldquo;Thrust not achieved&hellip; falling&hellip; Mayday!

  Viewed in light of the reported switch positions, the phrasing feels increasingly ambiguous. As is often stated on PPRunE, communication comes after aviation so you wonder why in the crisis and at low altitude, this message was transmitted. Being so atypical, the message merits re-examination.

  Given that it would have been obvious to the crew very late on that they were going down, might the switches being set to CUTOFF be a last ditch measure to try to prevent a post-crash fire?

  That said, switches found in the RUN position don\x92t generate investigative focus, they're assumed to be where they should be. The mere fact that the fuel switches are attracting attention implies there's something abnormal.

   This has all been answered in previous posts, but I'll repeat it for those you don't want to look back through something like 150 pages:
  </span>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <span style="color:#000000">
   Thrust Lever Angle (TLA) is measured directly by the FADEC, using a resolver hardwired to and excited by the FADEC. Both FADEC channels have their own resolver input - on most Boeing aircraft it's a common resolver with two sets of electrically isolated windings, however on the 787 it actually uses two mechanically separate resolvers. The resolver is basically read as "sine" and "cosine" which is converted in the angle. This also makes error detection easy, using the sine squared + cosine squared relationship. Any other aircraft systems that use TLA use the TLA signal relayed back to the aircraft by the FADEC.
  </span>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <span style="color:#000000">
   The fuel control switch is a two-position multiple pole 'latching' switch - you have to pull it out slightly over detent to move it between the RUN and CUTOFF positions (on other aircraft there is an interposing relay for some of the functions. not sure about the implementation on the 787). Moving the switch to cutoff sends a DC signal to both the High Pressure ShutOff Valve (HPSOV) in the fuel control and the spar valve commanding them to close. HPSOV is solenoid actuated and is near instantaneous, Spar Valve takes ~one second to change positions (yes, this is different than some other airframers that only send the signal to one valve or the other, but it's been standard Boeing design practice since the early 1970s). Both the HPSOV solenoid and the Spar Valve are designed to stay in their last commanded position if airframe power is lost. Moving the switch to CUTOFF also sends a 'reset' signal to the FADEC - meaning the FADEC will be offline for roughly one second. On the 787 (and 777 and 747-8), there is a brief pause (~0.25 seconds) before the shutdown signal is sent to the engine to allow the electrical system to reconfigure to prevent a brief interrupt of electrical power to the rest of the aircraft.
  </span>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <span style="color:#000000">
   Pulling the Fire Handle does the same thing as the fuel condition switch - via separate wiring (physically isolated from the fuel switch wiring to help protect from things like rotor burst damage), with the exception of the FADEC reset (since there is no requirement to be able to restart the engine after a Fire Handle shutdown).
  </span>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <span style="color:#000000">
   There is absolutely
  </span>
  <i>
   no
  </i>
  <span style="color:#000000">
   TLA input into either the fuel conditions switch or the Fire Handle - you can shutdown the engine via either
  </span>
  <i>
   regardless
  </i>
  <span style="color:#000000">
   of Thrust Lever Angle.
  </span>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <span style="color:#000000">
   All this is standard Boeing design practice (and except for the no-break electrical power transfer) has been for at least 50 years. This is enforced by the Boeing "Design Requirements and Objectives" - DR&amp;O - compliance with is demonstrated by an audit after the final design freeze.

  - fuel cut offs were found in the RUN position

  <br/>
  <br/>
  This should also dispel a lot of the comments about AAIB-India, Indian culture in general and general competence. For a preliminary report this is far more thorough and extensive than what would normally be expected and they\x92ve kept Boeing, GE, FAA and investigators from US, UK, Canada and Portugal in the loop from the start
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They have also clarified why it took so long to do the EAFR download- because of the extensive damage they had to source specialist equipment from the NTSB that only arrived on the 23rd of June (they downloaded on the 24th) so all that talk of a \x91coverup\x92 is pretty embarrassing now
  <br/>
  <br/>
  of course the big question is why/how those switches were commanded into cutoff in the first place  the exact sequence at Vr is the most critical, there hasn\x92t been much scrutiny at all that I can see in the Indian/international media of the personal
  <br/>
  background of the flight deck crew which has happened in other suspected pilot initiated disasters in the past, I guess this is an avenue investigators will have been doing themselves

    The CCTV footage obtained from the airport showed Ram Air Turbine (RAT) getting deployed
    <br/>
    during the initial climb immediately after lift-off (fig. 15). No significant bird activity is observed
    <br/>
    in the vicinity of the flight path. The aircraft started to lose altitude before crossing the airport
    <br/>
    perimeter wall.

    As per the EAFR, the Engine 1 fuel cutoff switch transitioned from CUTOFF to RUN at about
    <br/>
    08:08:52 UTC. The APU Inlet Door began opening at about 08:08:54 UTC, consistent with
    <br/>
    the APU Auto Start logic. Thereafter at 08:08:56 UTC the Engine 2 fuel cutoff switch also
    <br/>
    transitions from CUTOFF to RUN. When fuel control switches are moved from CUTOFF to
    <br/>
    RUN while the aircraft is inflight, each engines full authority dual engine control (FADEC)
    <br/>
    automatically manages a relight and thrust recovery sequence of ignition and fuel introduction.
    <br/>
    The EGT was observed to be rising for both engines indicating relight. Engine 1&rsquo;s core
    <br/>
    deceleration stopped, reversed and started to progress to recovery. Engine 2 was able to
    <br/>
    relight but could not arrest core speed deceleration and re-introduced fuel repeatedly to
    <br/>
    increase core speed acceleration and recovery. The EAFR recording stopped at 08:09:11
    <br/>
    UTC
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As per the EAFR data both engines N2 values passed below minimum idle speed, and the
    <br/>
    RAT hydraulic pump began supplying hydraulic power at about 08:08:47 UTC.

  What the hell happened in the cockpit?

  <br/>
  08:08:42  Engine 1 and Engine 2 fuel cutoff switches transitioned from RUN to CUTOFF position.

  Is option 2 possible? It was my idea too but does the switch "connect" when it is not properly in its guarded possition?

     Not really. It might also indicate that he saw them move, knew his hands were somewhere else, or a plethora of other reasons. Even if one accidentally moves a lever or pushes the wrong button, the first response would likely be denial as well, then followed by an 'oh oops, turns out I did'.

  yeah\x85. If you do something by mistake especially in a high stress situation you may often deny it outright initially

    the cutoffs were found in the RUN position so there\x92s a lot more to this story

     If you look at the mechanism, and imagine the physical obstacle that makes the lift necessary not being there, it could conceivably be connecting, yes. It would then be like any other switch, really.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Yes, I can imagine that. My point was that the obstacle was there. But someone operated that switch clumsily at it got stuck on the edge. Just imagine that like I grab the switch, pull it out, move it up to the RUN but don't release it and keep it pulled out. Will it connect already at this moment or it has to be like in the down, not pulled out possition? Maybe the switches got stuck and fell down on its own. The question is, is that even possible?

     The switch state could be either on or off in that position. However, the CVR makes it pretty clear that the switches were moved deliberately to off. Just not why. Also, remember the report says one switch was moved then the other. Not together.
    </div>
   </div>

  The exact quote was
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The aircraft achieved the maximum recorded airspeed of 180 Knots IAS at about 08:08:42 UTC and immediately thereafter, the Engine 1 and Engine 2 fuel cutoff switches transitioned from RUN to CUTOFF position one after another with a time gap of 01 sec."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Does anyone know what the sampling frequency of the data is? If we get one readout per second, then it's possible that a one second difference could only be a millisecond difference in real life, which doesn't necessarily rule out an accidental bump.
  <br/>
  If there truly was a second of difference, there aren't many other options than an intentional act. Not necessarily with the purpose of crashing the plane though (confusion, hallucination, distraction, ..)

  What a puzzle.
  <br>
   If it was a deliberate act, why put them back to RUN?
   <br>
    IMO, it's unlikely the Pilot Flying (PF) moved the switches in error or deliberately.  The PF has control of the aircraft at a low altitude.
    <br>
     Maybe the PNF just had a brain fart and just lied when confronted with the question, a very human response.
     <br>
      Why did it take 10 second to recognize the switches were in CUT OUT?
