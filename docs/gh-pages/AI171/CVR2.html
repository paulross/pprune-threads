  this report is accurate, I'd hazard that a specific maintenance issue has been identified. If the "technical cause" was a system or parts failure or fault, then I'd expect a lot of similar 787s to have been grounded by now.

  How could the CVR have been "read out" if the CVR hasn't yet been located?

  The flight recorder on the 787 is called "enhanced airborne flight recorder" (EAFR), and it's a combination unit with CVR and FDR functionality. There are two on the aircraft, the one in the front has battery backup.
  <br/>
  Since it has been reported that the "FDR" was found, they also have the "CVR".

  Both the EAFRs had been found by Sunday. Is it unreasonable that there would be news from the devices by Tuesday?

     It seems pretty unlikely that a bird strike that took out both of those
     <i>
      very big
     </i>
     engines simultaneously would not have been fairly obvious in ways that nearby observers (e.g., the crew, ATC, airport personnel?) would have noticed. Possible, of course, but I don't think we've seen any evidence that points in that direction. Also, for what it's worth, the
     <i>
      Times of London
     </i>
     June 15 story "
     <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/world/asia/article/new-clues-point-to-engine-failure-for-cause-of-air-india-plane-crash-vhqw6b7v3" target="_blank">
      New clues point to engine failure for cause of Air India plane crash
     </a>
     " cited here in the closed thread includes this:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     A poster in the closed thread pointed out, properly I think, that the
     <i>
      Times
     </i>
     shouldn't be relied upon for presentation or interpretation of technical information. Like most general news organizations, their reporters and editors (mostly) just don't have the background to assess, filter and explain complex processes and technology. Unlike many, though, the
     <i>
      Times
     </i>
     can generally be relied upon to seek appropriate sources and report accurately what those sources say. I think it's very likely that Indian authorities
     <i>
      have
     </i>
     ruled out a bird strike, and I also think those authorities are competent to make that decision.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Thanks for straightening me out on that one. Strange though that bird strike theory was ruled out so quickly without examining the wreckage or hearing the CVR? And still, the video potentially shows an right engine surge on the runway. If not a bird strike, then for what reason? Maybe I'm just seeing things since no one else seems to see this so I'll leave it there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The second box has been recovered and the CVR is being analyzed so hopefully they will give an interim update shortly.

  As regards the pixelation in the take off image that you posted, I'd say that is certainly well spotted, but I think we all have to acknowledge that pixelation really denotes the
  <i>
   absence'
  </i>
  of information rather than it's presence. I would say that if this image were followed by indications of asymmetric thrust and an irregular take off and initial climb, it would tell us something, even in the absence of bird remains. But it didn't, and the aircraft took off with all appearing normal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To me, the video shows that whatever happened to the aircraft was symmetrical in as far as it continued in an (almost) straight line. That said, it is entirely possible that however grainy the video evidence is, somewhere within it there may well be a significant - even if momentary - clue, so this was a good catch, even if not the smoking gun.

OK, some of  these theories, just bearing in mind the the flight recorder (there is only one FDR + CVR combined) was in the intact section of the undamaged tail and has been with the authorities for almost five days......

Don't you think the worldwide fleet of B787s would have been grounded by now?  Such a glaring failure would be absolutely inescapable on the FDR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Whatever was wrong with this aircraft was present at rotate, unbeknown to the crew.  The fact that no ADs or notices to operators have been issued usually means that the cause is known and the aircraft was serviceable.  The statement from a prominent Indian Captain about the skill and tenacity of the crew, right up to the last minute is absolutely laudable.  However, the cynic in me says that the way is being paved for some bad news and by that I mean news that will do Air India reputational damage.  Expect more management of expectation in the coming days.

  I'm still going with

  a) Incorrect derate + low Vspeeds or

  b) Low altitude capture

      - RAT out? Almost impossible, I have seen no quality footage that definitively witnesses the RAT being out. Those who think they car hear a RAT type noise might be listening to a motorcycle passing or similar. It takes a triple hydraulic failure or a double engine failure to trigger RAT deploment. They happily went through V1 without a hint of rejected take off so as they rotated the aircraft was serviceable. These are big engines, they take a long time to wind down when you shut them down. I have never tried it however engine failure detection takes 30s or for the aircraft to react and they were not even airborne that long.

  Maybe you should have kept sitting on your hands, theory a) in particular is about as risable as the last one you posted. Do you still think engine failure takes 30 seconds for the plane to react?! Thanks to rkenyon for alerting us not to take your post seriously. You still don't believe the RAT was out despite the in depth audio analysis done by an expert in the field. You still think its a motorbike?!
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Given they took off at a perfectly normal point, at a perfectly normal speed, I don't see how you come to incorrect derate and low v speeds, or how on earth that would lead to a normal takeoff followed by sinking?

     Absolutely. This confidence that the EAFR has already been read is misplaced. It&rsquo;s a specialist piece of equipment and probably can&rsquo;t even be downloaded in India. It&rsquo;s most likely on its way to the NTSB, the BEA or the AAIB (UK) for analysis which will be done under strict conditions (for obvious reasons).

  It isn't. It's essentially just a CVR and FDR in the same box. The main USP is that you now have two of each, about as far apart from each other as possible on the aircraft.

  <br/>
  Each is downloaded separately in pretty much the same way as always.

  I was referring to CVR/FDRs in general being specialist equipment requiring specialist facilities to process. In any case, I would be very interested to find out where those from this accident are read. It appears from a post upthread there are new facilities in New Dehli that could be used. Having said that, for the EK 521 accident in Dubai the recorders were sent to the UK for analysis, despite a "flight data recorder centre" in Abu Dhabi being opened (again with much fanfare) by the UAE GCAA five years before the occurrence.

  The Indian AAIB successfully downloaded both FDR and CVR data from an Air India 787's EAFR relating to an incident in 2018, so your misgivings on that account are unfounded.

  I have no misgivings, I\x92m just challenging the assertion that because the recorders have been found, they have already been read. There\x92s any number of reasons why they may not have been read yet, in India or anywhere else.

     And again (I made a post somewhere months ago), why on earth doesn't any airport that is say classed as international, have 4k cameras installed.
     <br/>
     Look at how many pages have been "were the flaps out on takeoff", and such like, "Ran out of runway" - even (maybe), Engine thrust could be seen, bogey conditions, tire conditions,
     <br/>
     Could answer a lot of information as to "Was the aircraft in good configuration on Takeoff/Landing',
     <br/>
     The world has watched hours upon hours of potato cam footage of AI-171 taking off - plus a handheld phone footage taken by a kid, and that's the best a trillion $$ airline industry can do..?
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  If they had, we would still be looking at potato cam footage as we would only get to see it together with the (cleaned up) FDR readouts and paraphrased CVR protocol in a report +12 months from last week.

     the difference may lay in the content that was recorded and not so much the 2 identical EAFR's. Only the forward EAFR is connected to a dedicated backup battery (RIPS) which also provides backup power to the Cockpit Area Microphone. So in case of a major electrical power mishap, the forward - and likely (externally?) damaged - EAFR might be crucial for recovering all available CVRecordings. Hence the somewhat understandable split-up in news-reports, between FDR data (from the rear EAFR) and complete CVR recordings (from the forward).

  Absolutely.

  <br/>
  If the aft EAFR ceased recording at the point (just short of the runway end) where the ADS-B and likely everything else went dark, then the extra 30 seconds of CVR recording from the forward recorder could well be crucial to the investigation.

     Investigations of all types first establish what happened, then how and why, before recommendations and actions. There is a possibility that they know the what, but the how and why incur liability.

     The Indian AAIB successfully downloaded both FDR and CVR data from an Air India 787's EAFR relating to an incident in 2018, so your misgivings on that account are unfounded.

  Could the fellow who was cited as having heard the CVR and commended the pilot's actions.... because he trained under the Captain, and would be familiar with his speech, have been bought in to
  <u>
   validate
  </u>
  who was speaking on the transcript?
