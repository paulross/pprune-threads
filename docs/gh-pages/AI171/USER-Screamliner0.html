  Hi everyone, 787 driver here, well lets look at the facts we see
  <br>
   very late rotation, but pitch and departure path look like normal up until stalling point.
   <br>
    mayday was called but without clarification or purpose, for me this indicates stress in the flight deck, especially low level
    <br>
     no smoke or fire from engines, I would rule out severe damage or birdstrikes at this point
     <br>
      Flaps 5 departure would be difficult to see as a pixel on a bad video, but they would not have made the rotation at that speed so I assume they used flaps during departure, also you would neglect to ECL's and a config warning
      <br>
       no RAT to be seen either, again ruling out dual engine failure, also the climb would not have been so parabolic
       <br>
        maybe single engine fuel starvation/Mechanical issue/dirty fuel, but seems unlikely, the flight path is too gentle
        <br>
         Gear stays down, and even though the pitch remains the same, they start losing lift and basically stall the aircraft into the ground
         <br>
          don't forget, Air India uses 64/67K engines on they're 787's, with temp of 41 degrees (ambient, so even more above tarmac) and a QNH of 1001, those engines will be pushed to "hard work mode" already
          <br>
           <br>
            IMHO, two things I could assume happend
            <br>
             - either single engine failure, no pitch adjustment and speed fell below Vstall, OR, most likely
             <br>
              - mixup of Flaps moved to up position in stead of Gear moved to up position, that would clarify the gear, would clarify the loss of lift and that the engines have no smoke, and no RAT,
              <br/>

  maybe something we havent thought about, used the wrong zfw/tow, too much derate to make the departure, TO2 selected in stead of TO

  I'm reading a lot of the comments, speculation is something we all like, but some things just do not add up, even with a RAT deployed
  <br/>
  <br/>
  if they had dual engine failure around 50 feet where you raise the gear, how can they still find the energy to climb, since they would be at VR/V2 speed (not V2+20 at that altitude, what VNAV would command after take off, especially with a take off weight of around 205/210 tons, the 787 wings are amazing but not miracles
  <br/>
  <br/>
  if they had a normal departure, why did they not raise the gear, they had a positive rate since they were climbing and the speed according to ADS-B was a constant. if they were single engine ! this would have saved them with this weight and weather, one of the first things you learn when EFATO with a 787, raise the gear, your climb performance increases dramatically
  <br/>
  <br/>
  if they did an intersection departure with they're genex 64-70K engines, they would have had a take off limited weight of around 172 tons, I estimate that they were close to 205/210 tons, (max zfw of around 161 tons and around 45/50 tons of fuel) even full length would have been a stress for the engines, with the prevailing weather conditions, intersection take off can be ruled out, they would have never made it, full length is already difficult.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When we see the video, the airplane is still climbing / flying straight and level (not losing altitude), yet we hear what we think might be the RAT, I can't imagine that they had the kinetic energy to do this with no engines. if they had dual engine failure, they would have been a brick, Hot and High, no thrust, flaps 5, zero chance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  flickering of lights etc. seen by the survivor and the loud bang heard, I would not trust pax observations, because of the things they had to go through, also and I've said this before, if it was a loud bang, where is the smoke and fire in the engines, or in the video, its not audible
  <br/>
  <br/>
  lets see what the report will say, but it it could be a lot to swallow for some

  So one thing to keep in mind, the RAT can be deployed manually, but also comes automatically when certain conditions arise, everybody here is assuming it\x92s only on dual engine failure but there are 4 more conditions that trigger the RAT,
  <br>
   <br>
    - all three hydraulic system pressures are low
    <br/>
    <br/>
    - loss of all electrical power to the captain and first officers flight instruments
    <br/>
    <br/>
    - loss of all four EMP\x92s (electro motor driven pump) and faults in the flight controls system occur during arrival
    <br/>
    <br/>
    - loss of all four EMP\x92s and an engine fails during take off.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This all comes directly from B787 FCOM,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If we assume that what our survivor saw is correct, maybe it was an electrical failure, the aircraft had electrical issues in Delhi during departure and I checked the crash video again, I don\x92t see the strobe lights (neither wing or tail) and also no Anti collision light either. this might also explain the self starting APU on loss of the electrics (engine driven generators). That could also result in a loss of situational awareness with the speed, because of no indication, even the HUD would not work. The mayday call would still be doable because the radios work from the battery.
