    What evidence do we have that the RAT was deployed? All I can find is people talking about a "noise" which seems very thin evidence indeed.

  </div>
  Enhanced audio files from 2 independent people, one of whom has experience in forensic audio evidence, and a screen grab from one of the videos, albeit very blurry. So both visual and aural evidence which given the circumstances I&rsquo;d say is fairly compelling if not completely conclusive.

     I disagree. I think the lines of the underneath of the aircraft are quite obvious and its clear there's no RAT. Given it drops on the wing to body fairing just behind the main landing gear on the starboard side of the aircraft, it should be very obvious in this photo.

     (Sorry, Airbus here and not familiar with Boeing) Flap 5 to 1 reduction on the Boeing triggers autothrust reduction, is that correct? If so, are there any other conditions that need to be met for this to happen like being in some kind of takeoff mode? Just thinking whether this would have potential otherwise in other regimes to cause issues, discontinued approach perhaps.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Am slightly puzzled as to why if flap reduction triggering climb thrust is part of the standard logic (and presumably clean-up technique) then partial dual thrust loss wouldn&rsquo;t be immediately recognised as the classic symptom of gear / flap retraction handling error? I presume Boeing pilots / air India are just as aware of this it as everyone else, strikes me as odd that one would immediately go into full dual EF mode. My instinctive reaction without knowing the Boeing would be to firewall both TLs, would this have worked in the early flap retraction logic scenario? Many thanks all
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Well I&rsquo;m a triple driver so can&rsquo;t be sure for the 78, but during the preflight we can programme thrust reduction either at and altitude or at flap 5 or 1. The company I&rsquo;m with at the moment it&rsquo;s an altitude, the one I was at before was usually at a flap setting. I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s got anything to do with this accident though. I guess you could enter 150ft instead of 1500ft in the FMC for the thrust reduction which would be alarming when it happened for sure but doesn&rsquo;t explain the RAT or the gear observations&hellip;.. unless someone did something like the memory items in response to what they perceived to be a double engine failure, but at that altitude, with no confirmation of any failure? I wouldn&rsquo;t have thought so but never say never.

     So for those getting in the weeds with one in several trillion (or lower) probabilities of systems failures have you considered that that improper RTOW (with or without improper flap setting), flap retraction / climb thrust trigger, is of much higher probability and has actually happened ?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Anyway I think we&rsquo;ll find out soon if a systems failure was involved.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The FLCH Hold thing (Asiana) was never an issue and well known (at least on our line). And for a crew of 3 (or 4) to press a destabilized approach getting 40-ish knots too slow (!) isn&rsquo;t a systems problem &mdash; it&rsquo;s a breach of basic airmanship.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Have you considered that what you have described won&rsquo;t deploy the rat, initiate the gear retraction sequence or cause the auto start of the APU, all of which there is a fair bit of compelling evidence for?

     After hours of reading I conclude that so far nobody has the slightest clue about what happened.
     <br/>
     1: Flaps were down
     <br/>
     2: The RAT story is based on a single unsharp video frame. Earlier frames were much sharper but the RAT could not be seen (although there was a sound).
     <br/>
     3. Lack of evidence
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I could be wrong, in that case please link QUALITY evidence so that we can learn something new.

  Visual evidence the rat was deployed, audio evidence the rat was deployed, evidence the APU inlet door was open, evidence the gear retraction was interrupted, evidence there was very little engine noise after departure, very obvious evidence that the aeroplane didn&rsquo;t have enough thrust to stop it descending into the ground. All of this strongly suggests that both engines were to all intents and purposes, and for want of a better word, &lsquo;failed&rsquo; now that could be intentional, accidental or because of some sort of technical malfunction or external factor. Nothing conclusive and no answers as to how or why, but not quite as wildly stabbing in the dark as your post would infer.

     We agree that there was a lack of thrust. Possibly caused by a dual engine failure. But the sharpest frames in the video do NOT show the RAT and this is counter evidence to the RAT theory. If there were substantial technical failures who knows what sounds could be generated. I find the evidence weak at best. And we immediately get into a chicken-egg problem: did some power issue of unknown nature cause an engine failure or did a dual engine failure occur, resulting in a power loss? Both are extremely unlikely and need to be backed by quality evidence. The video is not it, in my opinion. I don't know the APU intake mechanism and whether it could open after the impact.

     There is a possibility that doesn\x92t get much air time on this forum that satisfies all the \x91facts\x92 ( pprune facts mind you), and requires less mental gymnastics to believe than many of the theories put forward. I\x92m not saying it\x92s what happened at all but it seems much more likely than a TCMA fault to me.
     <br/>
     This link is to a Japanese report on a Jetstar 787-8 with GE engines that had both engines drop below idle while airborne due to magnesium salts effecting the operation of the FSV spools. The Magnesium salts came from a biocide dose by maintenance two days earlier.
     <br/>
     For some reason  I can\x92t paste the link but if you google JTSB the report number is AI2020-2.
     <br/>
     I think it\x92s quite easy to imagine that a simple maintenance error ( 1000ppm instead of 100ppm) combined with extremely bad luck on timing lead to this accident.
     <br/>
     I think I\x92m favouring a theory like this for its simplicity and the fact that fuel is the elephant in the room when you are dealing with a dual engine failure.

   That&rsquo;s really interesting, I&rsquo;d not heard of that incident. The report does say though that particular biocide had been withdrawn due to other engine thrust occurences.

  Water was mentioned earlier in the previous iteration of this thread, as I recall  by one of the most well respected contributors on the forum and an expert in flight testing and certification issues. There have been a couple of well known incidents of flight deck screens going blank due to all sorts of electrical problems caused by water ingress into the E&amp;E bay, fortunately in daytime vmc and not on particularly electric jets, and both I believe at rotation. The one I recall had it&rsquo;s L1 door left open during a black rainstorm in Hong Kong. It&rsquo;s also been said that total electrical failure can&rsquo;t result in in a double engine failure on the 787, but I wonder what multiple sequelae could result from such water contamination with an aeroplane that relies so much on electrical power and software? Another very remote probability but many accidents and incidents are. I don&rsquo;t even know if there was any inclement weather before this flight, maybe someone could confirm?

     Non-aviation engineer here: I have a question about the low level altitude capture theory that I've been a bit hesitant to ask, since no-one else seemed to be bringing it up.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     My understanding of altitude capture is that the autopilot will automatically adjust
     <i>
      both
     </i>
     thrust
     <i>
      and pitch
     </i>
     to intercept the requested altitude. However to my eyes there is very little pitch adjustment in the CCTV video of the plane taken from behind, until the very end of the video when it pitches up somewhat (obscured by buildings, more visible in the smartphone video). Please correct me if I'm wrong but I'd have thought that if the autopilot was trying to capture a very low altitude it would start pitching down (quite noticeably!) to do so, not remain at what looks like 10+ degrees nose-up. I honestly struggle to reconcile what I'm looking at in the video with an attempt to level off at 0ft, 200ft, or any of the other mentioned low-level altitudes.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Also maybe I'm missing something 787-specific but generally doesn't the autopilot have to be activated for the aircraft to automatically attempt to capture the pre-selected altitude? That was the case in this incident involving a Dash 8 and a target altitude of 0 feet that I am reading about (
     <a href="https://www.gov.uk/aaib-reports/aaib-investigation-to-dhc-8-402-dash-8-g-ecoe" target="_blank">
      https://www.gov.uk/aaib-reports/aaib...-dash-8-g-ecoe
     </a>
     ). I'd have thought the PF would still be hand-flying the departure at the point that things went wrong, considering that the gear hadn't even been retracted yet...
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  That\x92s a very good question, and clearly one that those postulating the theory haven\x92t thought about either.

     It would be nice to see a graph of g forces/turbulence. An awkward arm or hand position in combination with sudden turbulence and perhaps worn out switches could hit both of them.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Sleeves or lanyards that got caught while moving around? Perhaps there was an attempt to press a radio button, although it would be a strange time to do that. But perhaps an 'oh crap, I forgot to get that frequency ready' moment.

  Really? It suggests to me and I would imagine the vast majority of us who have flown modern Boeings that they were physically moved, by one of the crew, one at a time, the question is why.

     Ok I read through most of the posts but everyone seemed to be saying the same thing.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Haven\x92t heard anyone ask about CBs tripping?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Would that be possible on 787 and Capt knew where to look and push them back in?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I mean that could be done in 10 seconds?
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Sorry, I might be missing something, but what on earth have CBs got to do with this?

     There is a lot of grasping at straws in this thread. It seems pretty simple to me and only one explanation that fits the evidence. About three seconds after takeoff the Captain noted the FO turn of the fuel cutoff switches. He immediately questioned that for obvious reasons and the FO replied he did not again for reasons that seem obvious to me. He did not want it on the tape and he wanted to delay the Captain in trying to switch them back on. Had the fuel cutoff switches been restored immediately before the engines unspooled the accident would have been avoided. In addition the timing of the cutoff switches movement is exactly what you would expect if the copilot was using one hand trying to be discreet in his actions.

  Why are you assuming it was the FO that moved them?
