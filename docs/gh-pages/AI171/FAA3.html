  I've heard of conspiracy theories, but thinking that Boeing and the FAA have allowed the 787 to be certified with a non-compliant fuel system operation is going a bit far. And what about EASA? Plenty of European operators of 787s; EASA must agree it's compliant. "A320/737 does this" is totally irrelevant.

  - fuel cut offs were found in the RUN position
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - on take off roll both engines lost power as the fuel cut offs went from RUN to cutoff
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - CVR recorded one pilot asking why they had gone to CUTOFF
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - within 10 seconds the fuel cutoff was moved back to RUN
  <br/>
  <br/>
  -RAT was deployed, APU had begun auto start
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - 32 seconds after Vr the MAYDAY was called

  <br/>
  This should also dispel a lot of the comments about AAIB-India, Indian culture in general and general competence. For a preliminary report this is far more thorough and extensive than what would normally be expected and they\x92ve kept Boeing, GE, FAA and investigators from US, UK, Canada and Portugal in the loop from the start
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They have also clarified why it took so long to do the EAFR download- because of the extensive damage they had to source specialist equipment from the NTSB that only arrived on the 23rd of June (they downloaded on the 24th) so all that talk of a \x91coverup\x92 is pretty embarrassing now
  <br/>
  <br/>
  of course the big question is why/how those switches were commanded into cutoff in the first place  the exact sequence at Vr is the most critical, there hasn\x92t been much scrutiny at all that I can see in the Indian/international media of the personal
  <br/>
  background of the flight deck crew which has happened in other suspected pilot initiated disasters in the past, I guess this is an avenue investigators will have been doing themselves

  I don\x92t think we can rule out deliberate based on this report surely and the lack of emergency bulletin being issued is quite telling is it not?

  We are talking about the Engine 3 position stop/run/start switches here? SB stopping engine shut down if thrust lever are beyond flight idle? Blimey, seen a photo of the switches in question. Assume they are detented? Actually why are they not guarded?

     Both of the comments above imply that the 10 second wait to set the switches back to RUN is excessive and inexplicable for an "experienced" pilot.
     <br/>
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Ever since the two 767 events in the mid 1980's where a pilot - thinking he was activating the supervisory Electronic Engine Control switches - set both engine fuel switches to CUTOFF (fortunately at ~3,000 ft. so the engines had time to relight and recover), the FAA has mandated something called a "Quick Windmill Relight" capability.  Basically - with the engine at high power - the fuel switch is set to CUTOFF, then (IIRC) ten seconds later set back to RUN.  The engine must recover and produce thrust within (again, IIRC) 90 seconds.  It's a very challenging test for the FADEC s/w.
  <br/>
  I assume the 10 second pause is based on how long it took the two 767 event pilots to realize their error and return the switches to RUN.

  Unless defective. I only encountered one in a 30 plus year career where my Captain shutdown at block in and did not like the feel and checked that the detent was worn. Wrote it up. But Boeing installed some that did not have a detent and the FAA issued a SAIB, referenced in the Air India mishap report, to check for these switches because they could inadvertently be positioned to off. Whether they meant human or other inadvertent action was not clear.

     When I was a young F/O, some of the captains I flew with had the (annoying) habit of resting their hands just behind the thrust levers on their PM (PNF) sectors to 'be ready' to reject the takeoff. This would put the hands in the vicinity of the Fuel Cutoffs, which would, in turn, increase the chances of an unintended action on these switches. Is this a possibility, or am I way off?

  Good question as the report says FAA advisory NM-18-33 (check for potential fuel cut-off switches fault) was not implemented by Air India.
