  WHEN something catastrophic happens, like dual engine failure, that then creates a query about any "duality" between two standalone systems that really should have nothing whatsoever in common... except the PF.
  <br/>
  Nothing in common? Is that really the case for the 787-8 in the Air India 787 crash?
  <br/>
  Look at these three TCMA-related links in the order presented and note the proforma prescriptive caveats in the first two:
  <br/>
  <br/>

  <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US6704630B2/en" target="_blank">
   https://patents.google.com/patent/US6704630B2/en
  </a>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  TCMA is designed to detect and accommodate single failures within the EEC/FADEC, preventing a failure from jeopardizing the safe operation of the aircraft.
  <br/>
  Implementation:
  <br/>
  It involves implementing specific software changes within the engine's control system (EEC).
  <br/>
  Regulation:
  <br/>
  After some incidents, the design change was mandated by regulators, with a deadline for production aircraft by December 31, 2018, and a retrofit plan for existing aircraft.
  <br/>
  Boeing 787 Application:
  <br/>
  The TCMA feature is specifically relevant to the 787-8 equipped with GEnx-1B engines, but it may also be applicable to other 787 variants using the same engine type.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first two links are respectively the request for and FAA affirmation/approval for a GENx-1b software system called TCMA (Thrust Control Malfunction Accommodation). TCMA is the system that precludes High Uncommanded Thrust (HUT) after touchdown by fuel-chopping the engines. It is designed to avoid runway departures. One input is power-lever position. It's then fair to say that (additionally) Air/Ground sensing is quintessentially vital (as to when the system is "armed" and can do this fuel-chop). The third link is the complex description (with diagrams) of the patent application's design functionality of TCMA.
  <br/>
  FROM THE 3rd link above:
  <br/>
  "&ZeroWidthSpace;&ZeroWidthSpace;&ZeroWidthSpace;&ZeroWidthSpace;&ZeroWidthSpace;&ZeroWidthSpace;The method of the present invention compares the engine's actual power level with a threshold contour defined by the TCMA software package. When the TCMA software package determines that a thrust control malfunction has occurred, based on the engine's power level exceeding the threshold contour, the engine is shut down by the TCMA circuit." It is also notable that it says within the 3rd link that "Typically the aircraft is allowed to operate for a limited period of time with just a single operative processing subsystem."
  <br/>
  That Air India 787 was not long out of maintenance.
  <br/>
  We are then motivated to ask "what dictates the Air/Ground sensing". Is it just a Weight-on-Wheels microswitch or a RADAlt? (or both? or triplicated micro-switches?). We may then ask: "Did Air India implement the post-5G changes to their RADAlts that concentrated on maintaining their auto-land capability (in the face of 5G interference with RADAlts?) I seem to recall that the FAA's dictums on this pointed out that it was an individual nation's responsibility to both control their 5G frequency spectrums and implement changes to Radar altimeters that would work interference-free in critical phases of flight. What has the Indian regulator done in this regard as the responsible entity? The whole shemozzle, starting with the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) spectrum allocations, was an ongoing fight between the telecom giants and their getting their new mobile tech to market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  So where are we going with this line of causal reasoning? The only commonality/duality between left and right engines is the software driving the TCMA as monitored by the TCMA software incorporated in each engine's EEC. Most pundits have identified the gear-tilt as evidence that only the centre electrically-driven pump can do the gear-tilt if the engines' other two hyd systems are suddenly both in QUIT mode (which accords also with the instant RAT deployment and loud noise heard by the sole survivor) - and an ensuing transition from climb-out to a deadly sinking and commensurate attitude change for speed maint.
  <br/>
  My unavoidable conclusion is that the selection of gear UP and the breaking of the gear downlocks (and WOW sensing and energization of the RADALTs) called upon the TCMA to fuel-chop the engines (via the TCMA functionality in each engine's EEC).
  <br/>
  We could start by looking at the No Break Power Transfer (NBPT) tech used in modern airliners. This has led to Gen Control Panel meltdowns in 777's due to GEN contact meltdown. I know of one instance when a 773 was reduced to a RAT only landing enroute and another where a disastrous MEC fire occurred after start on pushback at LHR. A description of the systems glitch often experienced is at the following link. It's quite apparently a "gear-up" hiccup with potential damning consequences for smooth TCMA operation. As to be seen in the quality videos, a fuel-chop provides no real clue (such as engine failure/smoke/fire classically does). An uncommanded "reset" of the two engine's TCMA's upon gear retraction (link below) is trackable to be the sought after "duality" leading to a "both simultaneously quit" engine failure. These momentary electrical glitches and instant "resets" are described in the two links below. Food for reasoned thought?

  I'm honestly mystified by the obsession with TCMA. The FADECs control almost every aspect of the engines, so there must be numerous ways they could cause a failure or uncommanded shutdown. So, even if we assume that the engines failed due to faults in the FADECs, why assume that TCMA would be involved? Surely it's more logical to simply posit that some unspecified bug in the FADEC software caused the failure. That bug
  <i>
   could
  </i>
  be related to TCMA, but it could just as easily involve any one of the dozens of other subroutines that likely exist.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Various posters seem to assume that all it takes is an incorrect air/ground signal, and the engines would shut down. But in fact it would also require the FADECs to read the thrust levers as being at or near idle... AND the engines failing to respond to closure of the fuel metering valve. I've read the entirety of both threads, and I haven't seen anyone even attempt to explain how a malfunction within the airframe could cause both of those things to occur on both engines (or even one engine!).

  There is at least one thing common to the TCMA on each engine: The TCMA software.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  My recollection may be inaccurate, but wasn't there something in the software for 787 generator control units that would cause generator shut down if the aircraft was 'powered up' for a continuous 248 days? Same software, so all 4 generators would shut down. Is my recollection inaccurate?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  What we do know, for sure, is that the TCMAs have the same 'authority' and effect as the fuel cut-off switches. The difference is that the crew control the latter.

  Hardly surprising they have ruled out bird strikes.
  <br/>
  Just take a look at the video of the Thomson 757 bird strike at Manchester, quite dramatic visual evidence from the affected engine, smoke and flames, none of which is observed in the IA accident video.

  Agreed.
  <br/>
  Also, I expect the airport would've sent a car out to check the runway for evidence. Since we agree that the engine failure occurred near rotation, and that rotation occured well inside the runway (

  The problem with these reports is that the Indian AAIB and DGCA websites ( aaib.gov.in
  <a href="http://www.dgca.gov.in" target="_blank">
   www.dgca.gov.in
  </a>
  ) are mute on the subject of this crash, so even the DGCA inspection mandate quoted above is shakily sourced. On Friday, AvHerald had already updated with "On Jun 13th 2025 the DGCA reported, that initial preliminary findings rule out a bird strike as no bird carcasses have been found." I searched for a source for this, and found an "exclusive" which read, "The initial probe report of the Ahmedabad Air India crash, accessed by CNN-News18, reveals key findings from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation\x92s assessment led by the director of security." Other media simply quoted News18. There are two reasons to be skeptical here:
  <br/>
  \x95 first, we have seen fake reports circulating;
  <br/>
  \x95 secondly, News18 rates badly on mediabiasfactcheck.com: "Launched in 2005, CNN-News18 (formerly CNN-IBN) is an English-language Indian news television channel based in India. We also rate them Questionable based on a poor fact-checking record with numerous false claims."
  <br/>
  That leads me to consider that this "exclusive" might be sloppy reporting based on a fake\x97I have no way to know whether it is legitimate or not.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At this point, I feel we can only rely on information being official if it's published through an official website, or if there's independent reporting or a video clip from an official press briefing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I do believe the accident was not caused by an animal strike, for many reasons.
  <br/>
  But I wouldn't believe it based on unsourced reporting alone.

  There is a possibility that doesn\x92t get much air time on this forum that satisfies all the \x91facts\x92 ( pprune facts mind you), and requires less mental gymnastics to believe than many of the theories put forward. I\x92m not saying it\x92s what happened at all but it seems much more likely than a TCMA fault to me.
  <br/>
  This link is to a Japanese report on a Jetstar 787-8 with GE engines that had both engines drop below idle while airborne due to magnesium salts effecting the operation of the FSV spools. The Magnesium salts came from a biocide dose by maintenance two days earlier.
  <br/>
  For some reason  I can\x92t paste the link but if you google JTSB the report number is AI2020-2.
  <br/>
  I think it\x92s quite easy to imagine that a simple maintenance error ( 1000ppm instead of 100ppm) combined with extremely bad luck on timing lead to this accident.
  <br/>
  I think I\x92m favouring a theory like this for its simplicity and the fact that fuel is the elephant in the room when you are dealing with a dual engine failure.

  In that report, the factual conclusion is:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <i>
   4. PROBABLE CAUSES
   <br/>
   In this serious incident, it is highly probable that, when the Aircraft was descending for
   <br/>
   landing, there occurred oscillation in rpm of each engine causing both engines to temporarily fall
   <br/>
   below idle
   <b>
    at separate times
   </b>
   because Residue primarily composed of magnesium salts accumulated
   <br/>
   in spools impeded movement of spools that involved in fuel metering of both engines.
  </i>
  (emphasis added)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  and the narrative taken from the pilots is that while they happened in short order, the engine issues were not simultaneous. Not to say they
  <i>
   couldn't
  </i>
  be simultaneous, but they weren't. Also, the problems arose in the descent, as the engines were throttled back. Again, not to say it
  <i>
   couldn't
  </i>
  happen in the take-off, under full power.

     It seems pretty unlikely that a bird strike that took out both of those
     <i>
      very big
     </i>
     engines simultaneously would not have been fairly obvious in ways that nearby observers (e.g., the crew, ATC, airport personnel?) would have noticed. Possible, of course, but I don't think we've seen any evidence that points in that direction. Also, for what it's worth, the
     <i>
      Times of London
     </i>
     June 15 story "

      New clues point to engine failure for cause of Air India plane crash
     </a>
     " cited here in the closed thread includes this:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     A poster in the closed thread pointed out, properly I think, that the
     <i>
      Times
     </i>
     shouldn't be relied upon for presentation or interpretation of technical information. Like most general news organizations, their reporters and editors (mostly) just don't have the background to assess, filter and explain complex processes and technology. Unlike many, though, the
     <i>
      Times
     </i>
     can generally be relied upon to seek appropriate sources and report accurately what those sources say. I think it's very likely that Indian authorities
     <i>
      have
     </i>
     ruled out a bird strike, and I also think those authorities are competent to make that decision.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Thanks for straightening me out on that one. Strange though that bird strike theory was ruled out so quickly without examining the wreckage or hearing the CVR? And still, the video potentially shows an right engine surge on the runway. If not a bird strike, then for what reason? Maybe I'm just seeing things since no one else seems to see this so I'll leave it there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The second box has been recovered and the CVR is being analyzed so hopefully they will give an interim update shortly.

     I'm honestly mystified by the obsession with TCMA. The FADECs control almost every aspect of the engines, so there must be numerous ways they could cause a failure or uncommanded shutdown. So, even if we assume that the engines failed due to faults in the FADECs, why assume that TCMA would be involved?
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I think you may be inferring something that isn't actually true. It certainly isn't true in my case. Wanting to explore the details of a function known to be designed to shut down engines, in a case where unexplained shutdown of engines appears to be a likely cause or contributing factor, doesn't suggest that we are assuming TCMA is involved. It's just exploring the details of a a function that is designed to do that and doesn't put on a light, smoke and sound show, or produce obvious debris and residue, when it does.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I think those of us who are persistently trying to learn the details of the sensor inputs to and logic of TCMA (I prefer that characterization to "obsessed with") understand quite well the points you make here &mdash; at least those of us whose interest survives in this new thread. However, I at least, and I believe others as well, have also come to the tentative conclusions that (a) the accident aircraft had engines providing little to no useful thrust from nearly the first moments after rotation, and (b) the only possible reasons for that which have been considered here so far involve the sudden and approximately simultaneous shutdown of those engines, most likely by interruption of fuel flow (because that's one of the very few things we know that can do that without producing big bangs, flames and smoke, etc.).

    Surely it's more logical to simply posit that some unspecified bug in the FADEC software caused the failure. That bug
    <i>
     could
    </i>
    be related to TCMA, but it could just as easily involve any one of the dozens of other subroutines that likely exist.
   </div>
  </div>
  I don't agree that it's more logical to posit that something we don't know about has shut down the engines rather than something that we do know about that is intended to shut down engines. Do you know of other routines/subroutines in the FADEC that shut down fuel supply?

  Right, and you won't see a serious attempt to do that until we know, at least, what specific sensor inputs the TCMA function uses to determine the air/ground state of the aircraft and the logic that uses those to make the determination.

I've read the entirety of both threads, and I haven't seen anyone even attempt to explain how a malfunction within the airframe could cause both of those things to occur on both engines (or even one engine!).
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Many years ago I maintained a Hawker 1000 business jet equipped with PW305 engines with FADEC. The fuel control did not have a separate switch to control fuel flow to  shut down the engines. Shutdown was accomplished by pressing a release on the power levers allowing the lever to be pulled past the idle stop all the way to the cutoff position.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One day upon returning from a flight, the crew pulled both power levers to cutoff. The right engine shutdown immediately as expected, but the left engine kept running. By the time we in maintenance got out to the airplane, the engine finally shutdown by itself.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Troubleshooting found the cause of the problem. The cutoff position of the power lever closed a micro switch that sent a ground to the FADEC. That ground went through two discrete wires. One went directly to one input on the FADEC. The other went through a squat switch on the main gear leg to a second input on the FADEC. The engine would only shutdown immediately if both inputs went to ground simultaneously. If only one input went to ground, the FADEC would delay shutdown for 30 seconds. This was to protect against an inadvertent movement of the power lever to the cutoff position in flight causing an immediate shutdown.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The squat switch on the left gear leg had failed in the open position, causing the problem.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I am wondering if more modern FADEC engines have similar protections against immediate shutdown in the air? I can see why the designers of the Hawker implemented the system the way they did, because the shutdown command was integral to the power lever, and it potentially could be pulled to the cutoff position in flight by an inadvertent release of the locking mechanism that would normally prevent it from going past the idle stop, whereas modern FADEC engines like found on the 787 have a discrete locking switch.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But, if a similar protection against immediate shutdown does exist in the 787, would the engines keep running for a period of time (in the air) even if the fuel control switch was accidentally or deliberately moved to \x93off\x94?

  How does the 787 "manage thrust" after takeoff? The jet has only just left the ground; surely the throttles would be at maximum power and pitch would be used to attain and maintain V2 until the end of the second segment.

  Are you saying the pilot(

  ) just sat there while the ATS reduced the thrust (because is all it could have done, as it was at maximum for the actual takeoff).

  Fixed on what? Or did it "decay" because the PF pulled the throttles back?

  There is no evidence the jet climbed too steeply; I assume you saw the granular FR24 plot (from FR24 itself) which showed the initial flight path of this one was in the middle of the range, and the video clearly shows a normal initial climb and deck angle before "the @#$% dropped out of it".

  So BOTH pilots just sat there, didn't pull the gear up, did nothing else and crashed it (pretty well, I might add, with superb pitch control right to the last second).

     Firstly, condolences to all those involved\x85.as someone who also 'trains and checks' pilots and also has many years of Safety Investigation within large airlines it is a semi regular occurrence to depart with incorrect or no data.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Tiger took off in Sydney with NO data in the FMGC,
     <br/>
     Singapore had a tail strike in AKL after inserting the ZFW as the TOW
     <br/>
     Emirates almost crashed in MEL for similar reasons.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Not saying that this happened here
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Air NZ a few years ago almost put a 787 in the water out of Rarotonga as they had 100' in the FCU, took off, engaged autopilot and the aircraft pitched down and thrust came off, pilots recovered it at 60agl.
     <br/>
     Emirates has done similar, so these things happen.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  If this happens, and hasn\x92t yet led to a fatal accident, is it possible over say incorrect or no data could lead to a fatal accident (not saying it happened here).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Could incorrect or no data coupled with other issues (eg hydraulics, electrical or engine failure)  lead to a situation that might have been recoverable with the correct data being unrecoverable?

     There are several videos of the survivor being interviewed in India, all of them as one might expect, in the language of the country, with English subtitles. As Mr Ramesh is a British national, many years in the UK, I did wonder if there have been any interviews in English, in which I expect he is fluent. That might/should eliminate errors in translation and make his testimony more clear. I can't find any on the net.

  I don't think it will make any difference, english still isn't his first language and the bang he heard could be anything from a tail strike, load shift, catastrophic engine failure, rat deployment, initial strike/ impact. He is the luckiest guy on earth, lottery ticket stuff.

      - RAT out? Almost impossible, I have seen no quality footage that definitively witnesses the RAT being out. Those who think they car hear a RAT type noise might be listening to a motorcycle passing or similar. It takes a triple hydraulic failure or a double engine failure to trigger RAT deploment. They happily went through V1 without a hint of rejected take off so as they rotated the aircraft was serviceable. These are big engines, they take a long time to wind down when you shut them down. I have never tried it however engine failure detection takes 30s or for the aircraft to react and they were not even airborne that long.

     I'm still going with
     <br/>
     a) Incorrect derate + low Vspeeds or
     <br/>
     b) Low altitude capture

  Maybe you should have kept sitting on your hands, theory a) in particular is about as risable as the last one you posted. Do you still think engine failure takes 30 seconds for the plane to react?! Thanks to rkenyon for alerting us not to take your post seriously. You still don't believe the RAT was out despite the in depth audio analysis done by an expert in the field. You still think its a motorbike?!

  Given they took off at a perfectly normal point, at a perfectly normal speed, I don't see how you come to incorrect derate and low v speeds, or how on earth that would lead to a normal takeoff followed by sinking?
