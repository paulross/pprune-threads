    As per the EAFR, the Engine 1 fuel cutoff switch transitioned from CUTOFF to RUN at about
   </i>
   <i>
    08:08:52 UTC. The APU Inlet Door began opening at about 08:08:54 UTC, consistent with the APU Auto Start logic. Thereafter at 08:08:56 UTC the Engine 2 fuel cutoff switch also transitions from CUTOFF to RUN. When fuel control switches are moved from CUTOFF to RUN while the aircraft is inflight, each engines full authority dual engine control (FADEC) automatically manages a relight and thrust recovery sequence of ignition and fuel introduction. The EGT was observed to be rising for both engines indicating relight.
    <b>
     Engine 1's core deceleration stopped, reversed and started to progress to recovery.
    </b>
    Engine 2 was able to relight but could not arrest core speed deceleration and re-introduced fuel repeatedly to increase core speed acceleration and recovery. The EAFR recording stopped at 08:09:11 UTC.
   </i>
   <br/>
  </div>
  That was with 10 seconds delay vs. 13 seconds for engine 2.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Time was spent with the verbal exchange, and then perhaps each pilot expected the other to put the switch back?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anyway, the preliminary report also establishes that the aircraft had only 3-4 seconds of powered flight. (Would the gear lever be operated that early?) Everyone who saw that from the CCTV video, pat yourselves on the back.

  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mayday call, dual engine failure, RAT deployment all confirmed.
  <br/>
  TCMA was a red herring, the aircraft was firmly in air mode as the accident unfolded, and the thrust levers were at takeoff thrust the whole time.

      I have read most of the thread (old and new). As a lawyer working in forensic investigations, I am constantly involved in problem-solving. My field of work also includes complex investigations related to insolvencies, which almost always require an analysis of the causes behind a specific, established outcome. In doing so, I naturally also have to deal with probabilities. However, it often turns out that the most likely or plausible explanation does not reflect what actually happened.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Many of the considerations I\x92ve read fail because the simultaneous failure of both engines is extremely unlikely, leading to a constant search for higher-order causes. It was suggested that an incorrect altitude setting led to an early thrust reduction. However, this would not explain the deployment of the RAT (Ram Air Turbine), especially since the thrust could have been readjusted. FADEC and TCAM are highly redundant systems, and TCAM failure is unlikely due to WOW (Weight on Wheels) logic, making a simultaneous engine failure after VR equally improbable.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      With that said, and with regard to my question concerning the AD that relates to the fuel control switches (FCS), my thought\x97and it was nothing more than that\x97was that their activation becomes more probable if it can occur accidentally. That\x92s how I came across SAIB: NM-18-33.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Another user then brought up an iPhone. That notion would, of course, be dramatic\x97but how unlikely is it really that after approximately 10,000 actuations between December 2013 and June 2025, the two FCS no longer lock perfectly? Considering all of this, I find it quite conceivable that the A/T slightly reduced thrust in the first seconds after VR (e.g., if an incorrect target altitude had been entered) and that an object lying between the thrust levers and the FCS could have pushed the FCS into the \x93Off\x94 position. Due to the buttons on top of the switches, which provide some resistance, it\x92s even possible that the object both pulled and pushed them.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      But all of this is speculation. The investigation report will bring clarity.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Even if my theory is not confirmed, I still believe that the positioning and mechanism of the FCS are suboptimal. Switches of such critical importance should be better protected, and movements in the area in front of the switches (like reducing thrust) should not follow the same direction as shutting off the fuel supply. A different switching direction alone would provide more safety\x97especially considering that the FCS are protected laterally by metal plates.
     </div>
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  ï»¿
  <br/>
  I wouldn't put too much significance in the "01 second" since this still is close enough for an unintentional cause.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No matter what: The design and position of the fuel cut off switches is potentially prone for mishaps.

     If I recall correctly, the Mayday call was wording to the effect "thrust not achieved". That sounds like a phrase which could be expected from a pilot who had just frantically tried to restart an engine, and realized that it was not a success, and there would not be an opportunity for another attempt. The pilot aviated, (forget navigation), then communicated - over a period of 13 seconds.
    </div>

  I believe the 'thrust not achieved' was that one made up by a journalist - happy to be corrected.

  Sounds like #1 was restarting successfully but they just didn't have enough time for it to get back to high thrust.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  #2 may or may not have eventually started successfully; the extra two seconds of no fuel meant it would be a much harder start for the FADEC.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It doesn't sound like the crew have any input on the relight process; if the switch is on, the FADECs will try anything they can to get the engines lit and accelerating ASAP. Repeatedly switching between off and on will not help this process and there are basically no other controls the crew have, especially with no other power to run the engine starters.

     Double pole switches. Pretty simple.You'd have to short (or open) both sets of contacts simultaneously.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     One set of poles is for the circuit power, and one set is for the switch position data.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Far more than double pole - I think it's 4-8 ish. See the number of wires in the above picture. A previous post in one of the earlier thread indicated that it was essentially one pole per function - HPSOV, LPSOV, FADEC signal, generator etc. I'm not sure which one the EAFR reads. If it was a single contact failure, you would expect to see disagreement between the various systems controlled by the switch. I think that's very unlikely given both 'failed' in the same way near simultaneously and 'recovered' when switched.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For reference, it's pretty common for industrial emergency stop buttons to have 2-3 poles: redundant poles for the actual fault switching (legislative requirement above certain hazard levels), plus an additional pole for monitoring.

     Wouldn't they already know if the detents were missing in this case? They recovered the switches and told us what position they were in at impact.

  Depends on when they identified the SB and how obvious the lack of or incorrect fitting of detents is.

  I'd like to say something here that might help us all understand what probably happened. It's sad, but now that we know some clear facts, I think this probably goes a long way to understanding this tragedy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's a bit long, but that's probably necessary. I hope you find it worth the read.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  First up, I notice there's a tradition here to talk about "muscle memory". I understand it, but this is really quite the wrong term, and I think using the correct term will help clarify this a great deal. The muscles don't remember actions (at all, I think). It's part of the brain that's responsible (and I truly think that aircraft designers need to understand and take this fully into account when designing new aeroplanes/airplanes.)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The part of the brain in question is called the Cerebellum. It has been called "The Brains Brain" but again, that's inaccurate. The cerebellum is actually the brain's Automaton! Pretty close to automation, and in some ways, nearly the same.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Cerebellum is located at the back, lower part of the brain. It looks quite different, and appears to have a stringy appearance.  This part of the brain is responsible for all manner of physical (i.e. motor) actions. It is like an ECU or an EEC or a FADEC, or a GPU or all manner of sub-processing units in cars, planes, factories and so on, and I guess, in virtually all animals and humans. Basically, it is designed to take a lot of the workload off the brain itself. That's where the problem arises.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Just think about walking. You can work along without even thinking about it. In fact, if you do think about it, your walking is likely to become "unnatural". Just think about how it feels to nervously walk on stage in front of a big crowd. Am I even walking properly...? I feel like a robot! The conscious mind has taken control, and it's not as good at walking naturally as the cerebellum is. After all, it's been the one doing it, all your life.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  So, think about talking, writing, signing your signature, typing, riding a bike, stirring your tea, driving a gold ball, playing a well-practised video game. Think of "Getting the hang of it" - it's the process of the cerebellum learning a new sub-routine. Slow to start, but capable of lightning fast action once learned.  And some of its learning is evidently built-in from birth. Eye movement (&amp; focussing?), for example.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  So, having a cerebellum allows you to walk very successfully, while watching the traffic, talking to your companion, thinking up jokes, listening to the birds singing, etc etc. You don't need to think about it, because your cerebellum has learned since you were a toddler "How to Walk". It knows very well, and can even handle trips and especially slips. All you have to do is say "Walk to A" and the cerebellum does it, unless the thinking brain says "Hold on, stop."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is where the term "muscle memory" comes from. Automated actions, not from muscles but from the cerebellum.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Now, the problem here is that in effect, what I'm describing is, in a way, two brains. Scary thought! Even more scary when you recognise that it's virtually true.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If you take a look at the anatomy of the brain in a suitable drawing, you'll see that the cerebellum is not fully connected to and integrated with the rest of the brain. It's actually a separate sub-unit which is not even wired directly into the brain (the cerebrum, just to be confusing) itself. It's attached / wired to the rear side of the brain stem, below the Main Brain:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <a href="https://teachmeanatomy.info/neuroanatomy/structures/cerebellum/" target="_blank">
   https://teachmeanatomy.info/neuroana...es/cerebellum/
  </a>
  - scroll down to Fig 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Those of us who understand computers, networks, data-buses and so on will immediately recognise the problem. For a start, there's a bottleneck. And a source of latency. (The perfect word for this situation.) There's also a need for multiplexing - or, you could say switching. At least, there are two possible sources of control. Just like in the cockpit!  Oh No!
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Having the cerebellum where it is had/has a huge survival advantage. It means it's much "closer" to all the nerves that control the muscles - so that in life-threatening emergencies, the cerebellum can get the commands out much, much faster than the conscious brain can even think of them. If you're falling, the cerebellum will have reacted even before you've had a chance to think.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I learned this one day in England. I was riding an old bike to work, accelerating at a roundabout as hard as I could push. Suddenly, at full push, the chain came off. I don't (and didn't) even remember, maybe didn't even see, what happened next. One moment, I was up on the pedal, pushing hard. Next, I was in mid-air. Seriously, I remember this. I was in mid-air on the right-hand side of the bike, looking back towards the bike still rolling along beside me as I was falling. I was already about half turned, nearly onto my back. No idea how. (I was wearing a backpack, so apparently, it was my designated crashpad.) Next, I was on the road, completely free of any entanglement with the bike. It (cerebellum) didn't manage to get my right elbow out from under (maybe deliberately) but I landed mostly on my backpack, with my elbow pinned about under my right hip. The scars have faded now, but my forearm/elbow became a brake pad... Next thing I remember was sliding along a cold but fairly smooth section of road, head craned up, looking back down the road to see if anyone was going to run me over. A brown-haired young woman in a car was coming behind me, safely, watching, slowing. I firmly believe that my cerebellum was responsible for me landing so well. Nothing broken, just some skin off my elbow.  Like I say, I didn't have a chance to even think about it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  So, there's a big advantage in having a semi-autonomous processor operating in parallel, alongside the higher intellect. But every advantage seems to bring with it a downside, as I think we might all be seeing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The downside is, given a command by the cerebrum, the cerebellum will perform it. Accidentally, unintentionally, mistakenly, prematurely, casually, give it the wrong command, and guess what?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To tell you the truth, the older I get, the more often this happens.  My wife and I jokingly call it Autopilot. We're out shopping or whatever, a list of places to go, me at the wheel. A to B to C... Suddenly, we're back home, and I forgot to stop at the Drug Dealers... I jest - I mean, who would forget that! But talking is a great way to facilitate this. The cerebellum knows the way home far better than the way to the Candlestick maker, so, when lacking clear direction, evidently, it reverts to the most familiar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Exactly what happened here, who can really say? Not me. But this article (many thanks to
  <a href="https://www.pprune.org/members/198630-limahotel" target="_blank">

  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's totally relevant, the PF the obvious cause:

  <br/>
  <br/>
  I wonder what might have been the trigger here. Sudden high stress? Why didn't the gear go up? Who should have done that? When, compared with actual events? (Might have already been answered, sorry. I've been busy! )

  Ever since the two 767 events in the mid 1980's where a pilot - thinking he was activating the supervisory Electronic Engine Control switches - set both engine fuel switches to CUTOFF (fortunately at ~3,000 ft. so the engines had time to relight and recover), the FAA has mandated something called a "Quick Windmill Relight" capability.  Basically - with the engine at high power - the fuel switch is set to CUTOFF, then (IIRC) ten seconds later set back to RUN.  The engine must recover and produce thrust within (again, IIRC) 90 seconds.  It's a very challenging test for the FADEC s/w.
  <br/>
  I assume the 10 second pause is based on how long it took the two 767 event pilots to realize their error and return the switches to RUN.
