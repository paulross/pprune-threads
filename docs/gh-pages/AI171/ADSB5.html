     Resubmitting following some Mod Feedback and a significant re-write. Yes, it is speculative
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I have a theory that I'd like to share. It brings together various pieces of known information, along with 30+ years of my experience as an aircraft engineer that forms a plausible (IMO) explanation of what may have happened.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     We Know - From the Video's and the ADSB Data:
     <br/>
     That up to and for the first few seconds after take-off appears relatively normal.
     <br/>
     The AC appears to lose thrust without e.g. birdstrike or other spectacular smoke /fire producing event.
     <br/>
     That the RAT deployed.
     <br/>
     That the pilot reported 'Thrust not achieved'
     <br/>
     <br/>
     We can see that the AC had a relatively busy schedule in the few days prior to the accident flight, so there was no significant downtime for maintenance activities that could have caused incident.
     <br/>
     The AC flew DEL-CDG on 11 Jun with quite a racy turnaround in CDG of 1h12m. The centre tank would have been empty at CDG on arrival, and would have been partially filled for the return CDG-DEL.
     <br/>
     CDG-DEL Arrived 01:47 am IST. Again the Centre Tank would have been empty. But quite a bit of fuel in the wings.
     <br/>
     8 Hrs later, at 09:48 am IST the AC departed DEL-AMD. For such a short-hop, Fuel upload would have been minimal, merely a 'topping up' if at all. Certainly nothing into the Centre Tank.
     <br/>
     DEL That night was fairly hot and humid - 57% at 02:30, 54% at 05:30, 44% at 08:30. That wing tank fuel could have picked up a fair amount of water.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The flight DEL-AMD would have only used the wing pumps. Thus any water in that 'overnight' fuel would have been vigorously stirred and evenly suspended. At concentrations that would cause no ill-effect at all.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The AC was on the ground at AMD for 2 Hrs, from 11:17am to 1:17 pm IST. The AC would have re-fuelled, first filling up the wing tanks to the top, then filling the centre-tank to whatever quantity necessary. There was enough time for water in the wing tanks to settle out.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The B787 Fuel system has pumps in the wing tanks, and pumps in the centre tanks. The Centre Tank pumps are also known as 'override' pumps because they output a higher pressure than the wing tank pumps, thus ensuring that with all pumps running, the centre tank fuel is used first.
     <br/>
     Should the centre tank pumps stop, due to either filure or running out of fuel to pump, the wing tank pumps then produce the pressure.
     <br/>
     In the event that all pumps stop running (e.g. an electrical failure), the engines will suck the fuel from the wing tanks. The 'sucked' fuel comes from a dedicated pipe in each tank through the 'Suction Feed Check Valve' (so that pumped fuel doesn't just exit through the suction tube). The suction tube pickup is in a slightly different position to the wing pump pickups.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     It is conceivable to me that the suction tube pickup could have been immersed in water, settled out from the fuel in the wing tanks.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Then - at start-up of the aircraft in AMD, The engines would have been supplied with fuel from the centre tank. Fresh Fuel. All OK. Wing pumps running and doing not much. But, I speculate, the suction pick-ups immersed in water. Waiting.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Start up and taxi out was all normal. Runway acceleration up to v1 appears normal. V1 - Rotate - (positive rate - Gear up? - Not my debate).
     <br/>
     But somewhere around that time, I speculate that a significant electrical failure occurred. Enough for the RAT to deploy. Enough for the fuel pumps to stop. I'll not speculate on the cause. We know that it can occur, that's why the RAT was designed to operate.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The engines at that point were at TOGA thrust. In a significant electrical failure, the engines will keep on doing what they were last told. Keep that thrust stable. So the AC climbed for a few seconds more. The pilots did what they were trained to do for a power failure, manage that, thankfully the engines were still going well...
     <br/>
     <br/>
     But there was only so much 'good' fuel in the lines. The engines sucking fuel themselves, the fuel would now be coming from the suction pickups, a different supply. A supply likely heavily water contaminated. It would take a few seconds for that contaminated fuel to actually reach the engines, but when that contaminated fuel hit, Thrust would have been significantly reduced. The EEC's would have been doing their best to maintain the thrust, firewalling the throttles would probably have little effect at that exact moment. The engines would have likely worked through that bad fuel in a shortish period of time, but a period of time that our crew did not have. A fully loaded aircraft producing less than take-off thrust, is not sustaining enough thrust for continued flight. The rest - is down to the skill of the crew in deciding exactly where to hit the ground within the very narrow range of choice they had.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  The 787 wing tanks have a water scavenge system.

     TCMA continues to be one of the few (very unlikely) causes of/contributors to simultaneous shutdown of both engines. So far, though, I don't think we've seen a credible scenario explaining the possibility that TCMA was triggered in this accident. I'm not sure I understand your speculation.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     In the scenario you are considering, it's clear that the air/ground state would be wrongly "understood" by the TCMA function. But we don't have,
     <acronym title="As far as I know">
      AFAIK
     </acronym>
     , a credible theory for how that might happen. Surely it would have to result from either incorrect signals from the relevant sensors or a failure of the related logic in the FADEC TCMA function, or a combination of those. Indeed, I don't think we yet know exactly which sensor readings that logic depends on or how those readings are fed to the FADEC. Does your speculation include any thoughts about this?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Also, the FADEC TCMA function has to "believe" that the engine is operating at high power and not responding to thrust lever operation. In your proposed scenario, is this also a logic failure &mdash; in both FADECs? Or false inputs from both TLs? Or are both engines actually operating at higher than commanded power levels?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Or do I misunderstand your post?
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Let me try and summarise one possible scenario and then link in some of the better posts provide evidence relating to it:
  <ul>
   <li>
    In error, PF reduces power to idle and/or reverse at a speed after V1 (either deciding to reject, or for some unexplained reason e.g. the recent BA incident at LGW)
   </li>
   <li>
    Decision is changed to continue take-off, thrust levers moved to TOGA
   </li>
   <li>
    Let's say the thrust inputs are similar to NM985 and TCMA is triggered; and engines shut down around the time of rotation
   </li>
   <li>
    A/C rotates achieving a maximum speed in the region of 184kts
   </li>
  </ul>
  Relevant "ruling out" questions, with links to posts that add new information:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Q: Would the a/c have enough kinetic energy a 184kts to climb to 100-150ft agl and then reach its final position if the engines had failed at, or just, before rotation?
  <br/>
  A: Theoretically possible - see calculation
  <a href="https://www.pprune.org/accidents-close-calls/666581-air-india-ahmedabad-accident-12th-june-2025-part-2-a-43.html#post11907161" target="_blank">
   here
  </a>
  . NB, the a/c actually flew 1.5km from the end of the runway and 2.3km from the likely point of rotation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Q: Doesn't the forward position of the gear mean that power failed after the pilots had selected gear up?
  <br/>
  A: Inconclusive - had hydraulic power had been lost prior to rotation, the gear could also be in this position - explanation
  <a href="https://www.pprune.org/accidents-close-calls/666581-air-india-ahmedabad-accident-12th-june-2025-part-2-a-6.html?#post11903849" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">
   here
  </a>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Q: If the throttle levers were brought to idle during take-off, would the A/C have applied autobrake, reversers and speedbrake?
  <br/>
  A: Yes, although there is a built in delay before reverser and speedbrake actually deploy - see
  <a href="https://www.pprune.org/tech-log/633070-boeing-rto.html#post10804842" target="_blank">
   here
  </a>
  .
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Q: Is the ADS-B data consistent with this scenario?
  <br/>
  A: Yes, e.g. the Flightradar data shows the aircraft decelerating rapidly (12 knots in 4.2 seconds) from close to rotation. However, it's not clear how accurate this data is. For one, the altitude data is +/- 25 feet, second, while I was under the impression FR would have received airspeed data from the a/c sensors,
  <a href="https://www.pprune.org/accidents-close-calls/666581-air-india-ahmedabad-accident-12th-june-2025-part-2-a-47.html#post11907550" target="_blank">
   this post
  </a>
  suggests maybe not.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Q: Does TCMA activation require the thrust levers to be at idle or does it function when the thrust levels are above idle, but where the actual thrust is above that commanded?
  <br/>
  A: No, the latter is true (i.e. idle is not required) - confirmed
  <a href="https://www.pprune.org/accidents-close-calls/666581-air-india-ahmedabad-accident-12th-june-2025-part-2-a-17.html#post11904756" target="_blank">
   here
  </a>
  - there are of course many protections against false activation
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Q. Did AI171 have the same software version / logic paths as NH-985
  <br/>
  A. Unknown. That a/c had Trent 1000s so to some extent the software is different, but we understand the TCMA logic is broadly the same regardless of engine. I have not seen a post clarifying whether the TCMA software has been updated /changed via SB since 2019 to account for this incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Be grateful if posters could refrain from speculative responses "e.g. I think this is unlikely because I feel x". I am not opining on how likely this sequence of events is, simply trying to summarise whether or not this theory has been ruled in or out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I also recommend

     The gear tilt position is not definitive evidence crew had selected gear up. I've speculated another cause for this non-normal gear tilt is that C hydraulics failed around time of rotation. This would explain the gear remaining in the forward tilt position. There are reasons why the crew may have not selected gear up,
     <a href="https://www.pprune.org/accidents-close-calls/666581-air-india-ahmedabad-accident-12th-june-2025-part-2-a-15.html#post11904572" target="_blank">
      see earlier post.
     </a>
     Therefore we cannot determine wow or air/ground logic from an assumed gear retraction.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Without knowing the 787-8 gear system, we know that is is supposed to be hydraulically moved from \x94nose up\x94 to nose down as the first step in the gear up sequence. But do we know that it would end up \x94nose down\x94 without hyd pressure?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another point pointing to that the aircraft did consider itself being \x94In Air\x94 is the ADS-B data sending Altitude from the first 575 feet at
  <span style="color:#000000">
   08:08:46.55 until at least 08:50.87\x85?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   I would think the sub systems like TCMA would use the same In Air / On Ground logic as the aircraft normally use?
   <br/>
   I come from an FBW aircraft with a Air/Ground logic that seems rather bullet proof and would
   <b>
    guess
   </b>
   the 787 wouldn\x92t use a less solid logic which probably, in doubt would consider it being \x94In Air\x94?
   <br/>
   It would be \x94logic\x94 for the TCMA to use this logic?

     I suspect both recorders will contain the same data. Given the radio transmission after the loss of thrust the aircraft still had at least the emergency electrical bus powered. This should have kept both recorders online. It is however possible given the 10 minute battery backup that Boeing chose to put the the recorders on another bus but that\x92s not the norm.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I'm pretty sure that within the 787 data is passed over the serial data protocols to a DFDAU - Digital Flight Data Acquisition Unit where it is stored as a form of database. Quite possibly XML
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Any device subscribing to the AU will be getting the same information. This would include the DFDRs and whatever is used for ADS-B

     I got the idea that with no (or very little) thrust, and with the aircraft falling, the pilot (may have) realized that he was in
     <i>
      out of control flight
     </i>
     , and falling.
     <br/>
     In a pedantic sense: if you make control inputs, and the aircraft won't or can't respond to them, you are in
     <i>
      out of control flight
     </i>
     .

  That doesn't seem to be contradicted by the only data we have - computed bearings, allowing for GPS error margins don't show any lateral course change after rotation.

  Given the ADS-B height figures are reported to have a granularity of 25' it's compatible with the video to assume a height around 90' at the last ADS-B data point. A simple ballistic calculation - speed 88m/s (171kt), 11degrees, 30m height, results in a maximum height of 145' - given the impact of aerodynamics the observed height in the video isn't in dramatic disagreement - ie it's possible nothing interrupted the flight path after rotation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Given the clearer land 100' to the left of the flight line the "in out of controlled flight" is sadly very feasible.
