  SLF.  But I've read in full both original threads and this thread.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Preliminary Report is written in excellent English, so I think one should pay close attention to what it says.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One thing I noticed is that at the bottom of P4 NTSB are stated as "..participated in the investigation".  However UK AAIB are only stated as "visited the site".  My reading is that UK AAIB are not participating?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another is that some items on the timescale are v precise, others much more vague.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A question :
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If the fuel switches were moved to cutoff, for whatever reason, what exactly would each pilot see as an EICAS warning.  I'm still unclear why one pilot asked the other why he cut off - actual observation of the action, or message.

  SLF: I have a small observation but I'm not sure what it means or if it has any relevance to the accident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Previously I had assumed that the ADS-B data cut out at the same time as power was lost, so I imagined that whatever caused the fairly clear loss of thrust would have happened not too long before. But this report throws a bit of a wrench in my understanding of that.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the report, the fuel cutoff switches transition from RUN to CUTOFF at or very shortly after 08:08:42 UTC. Both engines' N2 values pass below minimum idle speed and the RAT begins supplying hydraulic power at about 08:08:47. Does this not imply that the generators have already been lost? With the APU also being off (the APU inlet door is noted to start opening at 08:08:54), I would have expected ADS-B data to cut out at or before 08:08:47. But curiously FlightRadar24 at least claims to have received data frames from the aircraft until 08:08:51.640970, almost five seconds later and almost ten seconds after the transition to CUTOFF (though the last frame containing coordinates comes at 08:08:50.871005).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Could anyone with relevant experience confirm how long it would take for AC power to be lost in this situation? Also, is it usual/unusual for a preliminary report like this to mention if/when the flight recorder switched to its independent power supply? I imagine it would definitely be in the final report, but I'd hoped it would be easily observable enough to be in this one.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beyond idle curiosity I'm asking because the report
  <i>
   also
  </i>
  says the no. 1 engine's cutoff switch transitioned from CUTOFF to RUN at "about 08:08:52", which oddly coincides with the last ADS-B data frame at 08:08:51.640970, and that seems important somehow. Or more likely I'm just ignorant of some quirk of the 787's electrical system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For reference FR24's CSV containing all ADS-B frames supposedly received from the aircraft can be found in their post here:

   This might have been discussed but as has been suggested upthread; a possible scenario is that at some point, PIC took their hands off the thrust levers and/or placed them in a guarding position behind the thrust levers at their base - but by doing so unfortunately nudged the Fuel cut-off switches to 'Off' - perhaps 'helped' by there either being incorrectly fitted locking mechanisms or worn locking mechanisms ?

     The accident aircraft was written up for a status message of &rdquo;STAB POS XDCR&rdquo; on the previous flight, which is a message relating to implausible data from the stab trim switches. It was released from maintenance (according to the preliminary report) at 06:40UTC ahead of an 07:40UTC departure (the crash flight) with &rdquo;no fault found&rdquo;.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     On the 787-8, as all modern planes, switches are not cabled as dry closing contacts all the way from the switch poles to the affected end devices (FADECs in the case of fuel cutoff switches), but rather connect locally to an analogue/digital converter to encode the switch position data onto the digital comms bus ARINC629 which allows all aircraft systems to talk to one another.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Are the fuel cutoff switches, which are positioned adjacent to the stab trim switches, connected to the same ADC module which produced the error message on the previous flight, which maintenance was unable to resolve before the accident flight took off? I do not know, but it must be worthy of being looked into.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I believe the fuel cutoff switches are one of the exceptions to this. They are direct wired. Stab trim may well be too.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I think they're called remote data concentrators - in many cases it is a conversion from a direct digital input to a bus signal; electronics would not call it an 'analog' input unless it was actually measuring a quantitative value.

      Was the RAT deployed manually?
     </b>
     <br/>
     The report says,
     <br/>
     <i>
      As per the EAFR data both engines N2 values passed below minimum idle speed, and the
     </i>
     <i>
      RAT hydraulic pump began supplying hydraulic power at about 08:08:47 UTC.
     </i>
     <br/>
     This was 5 seconds after the fuel was cut off.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     It suggests to me that the RAT deployment was initiated while the engines were still above idle and generating electrical power. Obviously one of the pilots could have done it via depressing the switch, as it's a "dual engine failure/stall" memory item (see
     <a href="https://www.pprune.org/accidents-close-calls/666581-air-india-ahmedabad-accident-12th-june-2025-part-2-a-70.html#post11918946" target="_blank">

     </a>
     ) that won't hurt anything.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Is there a way for the RAT to deploy while the engines are still above idle?
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I think I have seen a previous reference that the generators are disconnected when you select the switches to cutoff (or very shortly afterwards), not when the engine actually drops below idle. That could account for a few seconds of spool down time.

     What is unusual to me is the 4 second gap between moving Eng 1 fuel switch from cutoff to run, and moving Eng 2 fuel switch from cutoff to run.

     One would imagine that in this situation, speed of response would have been critical.

  Aside from anything technical, I find this attitude really strange. This is a discussion forum, of course there is (and should be!) significant discussion about a bizarre crash of a modern widebody aircraft. There will naturally be speculation and some nonsense but this is a discussion forum and that is to be expected. What's the point in locking threads until the final report comes out?

  If the thrust levers were found in idle but, according to the EAFR, were set to TO thrust until the end, doesn\x92t that also raise further questions? I mean: Of course, the impact causes compression at the nose, but the centrifugal forces act in the opposite direction. So, if there is an objective inconsistency here, and we have a pilot who says he did not operate the fuel cut-off switches, while the EAFR indicates otherwise, then we have yet another inconsistency.
