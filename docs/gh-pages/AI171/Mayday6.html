     Something that occurred to me after I went to bed last night: My assumption that the FDR readouts would rapidly reveal the cause may be flawed.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Let me explain.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The consensus is that both engines quit shortly after liftoff (that assumes that the RAT did in fact deploy). At least one of the data recorders has battery backup, so it should have kept functioning when all aircraft power was lost.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     However...
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Over the years, I've looked at lots and lots of digital flight data recorder outputs when investigating some sort of incident or other engine anomaly, So I have become rather familiar with some of the interesting characteristics of DFDR data.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     On the 767 and 747-400, when you shutdown an engine and the IDG goes offline, there is a momentary 'glitch' in the electrical power system as it reconfigures for the available power source - this is why you see the flight deck displays flicker and return, and the cabin lights momentarily flicker. As a result, most of the avionics boxes 'reset' - this is quick, but it's not instantaneous. This shows up in the FDR data - sometimes as 'no valid data' for a few seconds, or as garbage readings of zero or 'full scale'. Now, looking at the FDR data, it's easy to simply disregard the data, so normally no big deal.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Starting with the 777 (and on the 787 and 747-8), this electrical power glitch was 'fixed' - there is slight delay (~quarter of a second IIRC) before the fuel cutoff signal is sent to the engine - during which the electrical system reconfiguration takes place so no more 'glitch' during a normal engine shutdown...Except whatever happened to these engines wasn't 'normal'.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     If there is a fuel cut at high power, the engine spools down incredibly rapidly - a second or two from max power to sub-idle. Assuming the fuel cut wasn't commanded by the flight deck fuel switches, the electrical system won't know it's coming, so it can't reconfigure until after the engine generators drop offline - and you're going to get that power glitch. Nearly every avionics box on the aircraft will reset due to this electrical glitch, and the FDR isn't going to get useful data for a few seconds (and then, only from the stuff that's on the battery bus).
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Whatever happened, happened quickly - it's quite possible that whatever initiated the high-power fuel cut didn't get recorded.

  Thanks as always TDR for your excellent professional input. It is therefore so much more perplexing that even you cant logic our way out of this impasse. That is, the assumption that the aircraft experienced a double engine failure (supported by a reasonably convincing argument that the RAT deployed), and yet no plausible reason (that we can see) for such an event. So some then collectively slip into the tired and lazy theories of intentional or unintentional crew actions that 1. beggar belief (intentional), 2. defy physics (flaps instead of gear despite clear evidence to the contrary) and call into question the professionalism of a very experienced Captain and crew as well as the aircraft manufacturer (because...well its Boeing so it must be software
  <img alt="" border="0" class="inlineimg" src="https://www.pprune.org/images/smilies2/icon_rolleyes.gif" title="Roll Eyes (Sarcastic)"/>
  ).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yet, the answer must be simpler and staring us in the face since logic and experience (everything you have offered TDR), tell us that modern airliner engines generally do not just suddenly quit flying at the same time. In this regard we can recall several instances of double engine failure associated with bird strikes generally involving large birds or large flocks or both. But it seems we have discounted this theory very early in discussion. Why? Because we cant see any birds, or flocks of birds or engine flames/surges or puffs of smokes from the engines which would support this. Really?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I have read all the 100's of posts (sadly) and while some very early posters tried to analyze the imagery, I suspect the very poor quality eventually discouraged most from seeing anything of interest. However, smattered throughout this discussion from the beginning to the end there have about four posts that describe seeing something where others have not. At least two of these were related to possible smoke but which were probably just the dust blown outwards by the wingtip vortices. Two others however have mentioned possible flames and puffs of smoke.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The video of course is very poor. There should be a special place in hell for people who subject us to looking at a video with continuous zooming in and out, inability to retain focus on the subject (it was just a CCTV monitor, not the actual aircraft they had to focus on) and constant camera shake. A video of a video, and then the resolution probably reduced for social media upload. This all results in a very unwatchable record of the aircrafts departure. The only immediate information gleaned seems to be some idea of how far down the runway the aircraft was at takeoff and the parabolic curve as it very clearly described the aircrafts flight path.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <img alt="" class="post_inline_image" src="https://cimg1.ibsrv.net/gimg/pprune.org-vbulletin/1924x1084/screenshot_2025_06_16_234448_d33678771d6a7785463c46839304d8b12dd634d0.png"/>
  <br/>

  </i>
  <br/>
  But take a look at this frame. The right engine shows an artifact (pixelation if you like) that might represent a surge flame. I can almost see a puff of smoke just inboard of the aileron that may be associated with that too.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Am I just seeing distortion? Am I just seeing some smoke because that's where I would expect to see it?
  <br/>
  We are all very used to seeing everything in 4K today but back in the day when everything was low res we used to join the dots. If pixels existed then something was there. If they didn't, it wasn't.
  <br/>
  So if it's just pixels caused by distortion then they have coincidentally appeared in the tailpipe of an aircraft that crashed shortly after takeoff with a presumed double engine failure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But surely we would see the birds? Well, not in this video. You cant even see the registration number on the side of the aircraft and that is much bigger than a bird. Haze, distortion, focus and low res, and each individual bird wouldn't even make up a pixel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  So make of this what you will, but this problem may have started on the ground. Birds strikes are very common according to Some AI pilots who interviewed for this following article but I have no idea of the authenticity of this report:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <a href="https://www.rediff.com/news/report/ai-171-crash-did-a-bird-strike-cause-the-crash/20250613.htm" target="_blank">
   https://www.rediff.com/news/report/a...h/20250613.htm
  </a>
  <i>
   "The Air India pilots also added that Ahmedabad airport has long been known for bird activity near the runway, which could have contributed to the incident.
  </i>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <i>
   "This issue (of the excessive presence of birds) has been flagged multiple times," a third Air India pilot said, asking not to be named."
  </i>
  <br/>
  Of course, a single engine failure would not have brought this aircraft down, nor would it have deployed the RAT, but we can't see what happened on the left engine when the aircraft slipped behind the radio antenna building.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While these high bypass engines are designed and certified to keep running after experiencing certain types of bird strike, the effect on two engines concerns have been voiced about the contribution of certification to the mitigation of the risk hazardous bird strike in the two engine case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This from Sky Library:
  <br/>
  <a href="https://skybrary.aero/articles/aircraft-certification-bird-strike-risk#:~:text=Description,they%20cannot%20continue%20to%20fly" target="_blank">
   https://skybrary.aero/articles/aircr...nue%20to%20fly
  </a>
  .
  <br/>
  <br/>
  " A number of concerns have been quite widely voiced about the contribution of certification to the mitigation of the risk of hazardous bird strikes:
  <ul>
   <li>
    The case of bird ingestion into more than one engine at the same time is not addressed directly and it is clearly extremely difficult to meaningfully estimate the probability of such an occurrence. However, it has been observed that, since some of the current standards only require that a damaged engine can be safely shut down, this circumstance should be more fully considered when determining the acceptable outcome of ingestion into single engines, especially for the twin engine case.
   </li>
   <li>
    It has been noted that the potential effects of bird strikes on modern electronic flight control systems and flight deck instrument displays have not yet been fully assessed.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <br/>
  Maybe someone can do some video enhancing of this image as others have done with the audio enhancement to give strong probability of RAT deployment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If my suggestion can be corroborated at all, then the question of what happened next becomes somewhat easier to answer. Perhaps neither engine stopped running but they did so with limited thrust? If anything from the pilots mayday call can believed, it wasn't engines shut down..it was no thrust. So why did the RAT deploy? Cant answer that. And, I cant imagine it would be manually deployed if both engines were still running.
  <br/>
  However, TDR did say.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "On the 767 and 747-400, when you shutdown an engine and the IDG goes offline, there is a momentary 'glitch' in the electrical power system as it reconfigures for the available power source - this is why you see the flight deck displays flicker and return, and the cabin lights momentarily flicker."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Startle factor that electrically systems were about to fail? Manually deploy RAT?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Edit: I might add, they would have found remains on the runway if this did indeed happen. But we have heard anything from anybody?

     Yes. But I have not flown this scenario in the sim. Way too many protection to take off without proper configuration which leads me to believe loss of lift due to flap retraction. 1100 hr FO \x85\x85..
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Very unlikely IMO as it's difficult to imagine even a low time pilot making this error--not impossible of course.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If you are correct and early flap retraction instead of gear.....why was the rat out? It is almost assuredly deployed.  Why did the video not indicate high thrust on the engines? The are silent. Pulling the flaps too early won't cause an engine failure(s) ans won't cause the rat to deploy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Even if inexperienced FO retracts flaps early certainly a senior captain who is also per some reports a training captain.....certainly he would have gone for max thrust and lowered the nose to try and fly out of it.  Certainly he would have raised the gear?!?!?!
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Still not making sense....unless....and I posted this earlier.....was it intentional?!?!?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Do we know for certain there was a mayday? If yes, do we know for certain is was the captain?  Could the captain have possibly become incapacitated around VR and low time FO totally unprepared and froze?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I am always amazed how foreign airlines put super low time FOs in biiiiig planes.....scary.  i chatted up an early 20 somthing Ryanair FO and she was excited bc she just hit 300 hrs.  I said oh 300 on type (737)??  She says no.....300 hrs...total time. And she's flying internationally!!!!!!

  Without a doubt one is looking at a very, very rare event, most likely the result of an unlikely/unlucky combination of issues, the grim gravity realised by the F/C (mayday) immediately after T/O. As a very, very FF/retired EU bureaucrat/economist/lawyer with an as ever staunch penchant for data/facts, I'm therefore wondering whether VT-ANB engines had already their EEC MN4 microprocessors replaced as mandated within 11000 cycles or 12 years per AD 2021-21-05
  <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2021-11-23/pdf/2021-25491.pdf" target="_blank">
   https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/...2021-25491.pdf
  </a>
  . This AD was prompted by in-service occurrences of loss of GEnX engines thrust control resulting in uncommanded high thrust. Uncommanded high trust on (at least one of) the engines during the TO-roll, in particular past V1, resulting in a discrepancy with the actual (likely derated)thrust settings, could have triggered TMCA on or just before lift-off.

     No, it's not. You got that value from ADS-B, which is barometric altitude at standard pressure, and when you correct for that, the highest value is ~100 ft. AAL.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Instead, look at the CCTV video, and consider that the wing span of the aircraft is ~200 ft. I hope you'll agree AI171 didn't come close to 400 ft. AAL at any point.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Reported 625' pressure altitude, elevation 189', QNH 1001.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  So they only got to around 100' height, half the wing span of a Boeing 787? I think it looks higher than that.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  189' elevation, QNH1001, the pressure altitude should be around 550'. First readout from ADS-B is 575', highest is 625'. I did not look up if runway departure end is much different there than aerodrome elevation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Interesting that the readout of pressure altitude doesn't get lower again, after 625', which could support the total loss of all AC (and most DC power?). Transponder possibly stopped working, but one of the pilots was able to transmit a mayday call. So they must have had some kind of electricity available.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  So what I mentioned about THR REF / VNAV SPD is probably not applicable. Yes, I did not account for the QNH initially, which makes closer to 100' than 400' AGL.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I will revert to await the official findings then, with a substantial loss of electricity seeming more and more plausible.

     At 100 knots during the takeoff roll the systems take a snapshot of the barometric altitude at that point. The 400' for VNAV engagement, if it is armed, is based on that datum.

  Thank you - it doesn't sound like it should be possible for a non-faulty autothrottle to activate below 400 feet then. Even if e.g. the "wrong" starting altitude is measured on the runway (wrong QNH, etc), as long as it is measuring 400 feet from

  Small correction, the 625 ft pressure altitude data point (~100 ft AGL taking temperature, pressure and field elevation into account) is the last received ADS-B data point, which was right around the end of the runway. The aircraft crashed quite a bit further on from that, ~1.5km from the runway end. If you take perspective into account it also appears to continue to climb for a few seconds after passing over the runway end. I think some people in either this thread or the first thread have argued that the ADS-B data cutting out could be indicative of power loss (like with the Jeju Air 2216 accident) and not just spotty coverage, and when I looked at other flights I was inclined to agree - coverage is spotty on the apron and runway, but once planes start climbing the updates become consistent. If that really is when the engines died, ballistics suggests that the aircraft could well attain another 100 - 200 feet off its sheer momentum before the inevitable descent.

  Re: mayday call transmission, isn't that easily battery powered? At least on the captain's side.

  Sorry, maybe the context was lost - I was responding to a theory that did argue that the aircraft was automatically trying to capture a target altitude that was incorrectly set too low. That

  What I cannot do is add new theories or uncover any new facts the actual experts have not already thought of. However, since summarizing and structuring information is one thing lawyers tend to regularly do (and sometimes even do well), here is my attempt at a useful contribution to this thread: an attempt to summarize the main theories discussed here since day one (which I think hasn't been done for quite some time) in the hope that a birds-eye view will be helpful to those who have not read everything since the beginning or might even trigger some new flash of inspiration for someone more knowledgable than me. I have focused on the cons since there does not seem to be enough evidence to come to any positive conclusion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I shall try to be concise and to refrain from personal evaluations of my own. Of course, no disrespect whatsoever is intended towards all those who have contributed to this thread and to the individual theories, one or combinations of which may turn out to have led to this tragic outcome. That arguments can be made against every single theory that has been propagated seems to be the result of the highly improbable and unusual nature of this deplorable event and certainly not due to any lack of knowledge or reasoning skills in this forum.

     rotation, takeoff and initial climb seem normal;
    </span>
   </li>
   <li>
    likely extreme errors would have been required to have such tragic effect (the fuel tanks should have been only about half full, so not close to MTOW);

   Still brought up from time to time. However, widely disregarded due to
  </span>
  <ul>
   <li>
    the fact that with two working engines an inadvertent flap retraction should easily be recoverable, even with gear down;
   </li>
   <li>
    strong indications that hydraulic and electric power were lost (audible/visible indications of RAT extension, survivor statement, lack of engine noise, position of MLG bogies).
   </li>
  </ul>
  <span style="color:black">
   For a while, the forward tilt of the bogies as first part of the retraction cycle was seen as additional evidence that the gear had been selected up. However, it has been pointed out that the forward tilt and the opening of the gear doors occur almost simultaneously so that it seems unlikely that hydraulic power was lost in the split second between bogie tilt and gear door actuation. It is now assumed the forward tilt of the bogies was merely a consequence of the hydraulic power loss.

  This incident is very perplexing to me. This is my first post on here and I am not a pilot. I have over a decade of experience in the RAAF as an engine fitter on Mirage and Hornet aircraft. Albeit a bit of time ago.
  <br/>
  I have watched the video's and looked at the FR-24 data a hundred times. To me it looks like a normal rotation and at WoW everything starts to go wrong.
  <br/>
  Airspeed starts dropping off immediately going by the FR-24 data. If reports are correct the pilot makes his Mayday call. FR-24 data stops.
  <br/>
  In the video from the balcony I agree the RAT is out and operating but I can also hear the engines at idle or just above (maybe flight idle).
  <br/>
  If the captain manually deployed the RAT this makes sense to me. In both video's I don't see any aircraft behavior that would suggest they are not flying the aircraft.
  <br/>
  Is there an electrical fault at WoW that renders the cockpit dark and therefore manually deploying the RAT (possibly initiating APU start, inlet door is open at crash site) would make sense to restore cockpit power.
  <br/>
  I can't understand any pilot shutting down both engines at 200ft AGL. He would surely know that his fight is over at that point.
  <br/>
  I am not ruling out pilot error (configuration or otherwise) but my hat goes off to two pilots that I believe were trying to fly this aircraft until it hit the ground.
  <br/>
  Sorry if my wording is a bit off but mine is military background not commercial.

  Assuming there is some credence to the article, dual engine failure due to water contamination is the leading theory. It certainly fits much of the speculation in this thread. It may be that the flight data was not captured and much more reliance will be on forensic examination of the CCTV footage and the wreckage. Those waiting for the flight data to be published may be disappointed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If the original CCTV footage was made available, together with a detailed survey map of the airport, it will be possible to accurately estimate the takeoff speed and altitude during all the critical periods. My guess is thrust was reduced or lost very early and perhaps before the aircraft left the tarmac. Then shortly after becoming airborne, power was lost resulting in the deployment of the RAT. It is doubtful that the pilots shut down the engines or the wrong engine. Likewise flap/slat misconfiguration is unlikely.

     You may be surprised to know that TCMA doesn't require that, it just requires a differential between commanded and actual thrust.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     It has never triggered during takeoff until now. Maybe it still hasn't been. We'll see. Given there is an actual example of a 787 in the wild shutting down both of it's engines when it shouldn't (ANA), I'm surprised how complacent people are that this couldn't be the cause..Software can always have weird corner failures that could never have been thought of or tested.
    </div>
   </div>

  Yes. I simplified. The point stands that the throttle needs to be pulled back, as it was in the ANA event, because that was a landing and not a take-off.

   First, you posted a good summary. I'd have added "unanticipated hardware fault" and "unanticipated software fault" as generic causes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Note that the thrust lever actuators are wired to the FADECs, and that the TCMA gets the T/L position from that. For TCMA to trigger, it has to determine that its FADEC (on that engine) failed to achieve a commanded reduction in thrust. So we're either looking at a weird, unprecedented edge case, or a FADEC failure, or both.

     new components being added to the pre-existing FADEC?

  It has been mentioned before that this capability existed as part of the N2 overspeed protection: the FADEC would shut down a runaway engine by cutting its fuel before it disintegrates.

     I am not suggesting you are wrong and, as I've said before, the descriptions and schematic in the patent application are just 'big hands / small maps' concepts. However, if TCMA functionality "is simply a bit of software in the FADECs", merely sending a 1 or 0 or other signal into a point in the pre-existing FADEC that already had control over fuel cutoff (with the TCMA software merely monitoring data busses, rather than direct sensor outputs, to work out thrust lever position and whether or not the aircraft is 'on the ground' for TCMA purposes) I for one would really like to know that for sure and get my head around the implications.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  The thrust lever sensors are wired directly to the FADEC (and hence the TCMA). No data bus is involved with this item.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With a MCAS crash, it required a hardware problem with an AOA sensor, used as input to a correctly working MCAS, to cause the aircraft to behave erratically. With a correctly working TCMA, I believe it'd require two hardware problems to get TCMA to shut down the engine, as there'd have to be an implausible thrust lever reading, and a FADEC/engine failure to process it within the TCMA allowed range ("contour"?). On both engines, separately and simultaneously.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That leaves a software problem; it's not hard to imagine. The issue is, at this point it's just that: imagination. I could detail a possible software failure chain, but without examining the actual code, it's impossible to verify. We simply don't have the evidence.
  <br/>
  I could just as well imagine a microwave gun frying the electronics on both engines. An escaped hamster under the floor peeing on important contacts. A timed device installed by a psychopathic mechanic. There's no evidence for that, either.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This process is a way to psychologically cope with the unexplained accident, but because it lacks evidence, it's not likely to identify the actual cause. We've run the evidence down to "most likely both engines failed or shut off close to rotation, and the cause for that is inside the aircraft". Since the take-off looked normal until that failure, we have no clues as to the cause hidden inside the aircraft. We need to rely on the official investigation to discover and analyse sufficient evidence. The post-crash fire is going to make that difficult.

  You're absolutely right, Musician! Your text in bold print is what happened! And you and I and many other pilots know what the most probale cause for that is. What evidence do we need?
  <br/>
  The EAFR will tell the story, but the reason for the crash will always remain a "mystery" because the B787 was not equipped with EPTPR's! (

     are taking a close look at a February 2020 incident in Gatwick, involving an Airbus A321, in which both engines malfunctioned immediately after takeoff. It led to a Mayday call before the aircraft returned to Gatwick 11 minutes later after a turnaround." ...
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ..."it was &ldquo;clear from visual observation and wreckage&rdquo; that the flight suffered a power failure." ...
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ..."The black boxes and the DVR have been recovered but the officer said that the devices were damaged and file extraction would &ldquo;be a complicated process&rdquo;." ...

     <br/>
     ... "We will check the technical logs to see if any of the engineering teams or pilots of the previous flight left comments on the performance of both engines"
     <br/>
     Assuming there is some credence to the article, dual engine failure due to water contamination is the leading theory. It certainly fits much of the speculation in this thread. It may be that the flight data was not captured and much more reliance will be on forensic examination of the CCTV footage and the wreckage. Those waiting for the flight data to be published may be disappointed.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     If the original CCTV footage was made available, together with a detailed survey map of the airport, it will be possible to accurately estimate the takeoff speed and altitude during all the critical periods. My guess is thrust was reduced or lost very early and perhaps before the aircraft left the tarmac. Then shortly after becoming airborne, power was lost resulting in the deployment of the RAT. It is doubtful that the pilots shut down the engines or the wrong engine. Likewise flap/slat misconfiguration is unlikely.

  Isn't "close to rotation" a little broad? "Close to" can be before or after. If before, and with about 4,000 feet of runway remaining, why did they take off at all? How did they take off, for that matter?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Can anyone do the Momentum / Energy calculations to work out how high the plane would have travelled at the normal climb gradient purely on the momentum it had at rotation? I'll try, see how far I get. A stone, fired into the air at an upward angle, begins to slow down and curve towards the earth the moment it leaves the catapult. It appears to me that the plane climbed at approximately a steady speed until about the 200 ft mark, so I submit that it had adequate climb thrust up to "about" that point.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Which, as confirmed in the earlier thread, is about where GEARUP is typically called. I say those two events are linked, led by GEARUP, but it could be coincidence. Though I don't think so. Coincidence usually refers to unrelated events and that would be very hard to say, here.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On that point, the gear, as far as I can establish (not openly published according to Google), weighs around 8-odd to 10 tonnes. Typically, retracts in about 10 seconds. I estimate it's no more than a 2 metre lift. As far as I can work out (using 3m to make the value higher), that requires about 30kW (rough estimate, budgetary figure, not accounting for it being a curved path, so it's probably higher closer to fully up), but whether wind pressure affects it, I have no idea. Anyway, 30kW isn't a huge (additional) load on a 225kVA alternator. Less than I'd imagined.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Now I'm wondering how big (power ratings) the hydraulic pump and motor are? No doubt, they're driven by a VSD. Can anyone comment, please?

  Just to summarize. There appears to be fairly wide consensus as to what happened:
  <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
   <li>
    Up to V1 it appeared normal and the pilots did not abort.
   </li>
   <li>
    Loss of thrust very close to V2 rotate or shortly thereafter.
   </li>
   <li>
    Loss of electrical and hydraulics resulting in deployment of RAT seconds after being airborne.
   </li>
   <li>
    Mayday transmission seconds after takeoff (although it may have occurred around V2, the timing has not been established).
   </li>
   <li>
    Gear tilted forward suggesting gear retraction was initiated but not completed.
   </li>
   <li>
    All followed by glide to impact from AGL of little more than 100 feet.
   </li>
  </ol>
  Why the above happened is rather less clear. In my opinion, fuel contamination/starvation, water, additive, vapour or otherwise, may have affected thrust during takeoff before resulting in total loss of thrust and electrical power. On the other hand, software/electrical fault would more likely have resulted in a sudden loss of the engines.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On that basis, there is still some mileage in establishing the aircraft speed in the last moments before takeoff. There is definitely mileage in identifying a single point of failure that would cause the engines to shut down; other than fuel contamination/vapour issues. I suspect that the official investigation is not all that further ahead of this thread. Without useful data from the
  <span style="color:#474747">
   EAFR they have to rely on forensics and history. Enough has been leaked to know the engines were no more than windmilling at impact.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A high level of interest will continue given there are still remaining questions whether the reliability of Boeing machinery is implicated. That is not to mention the hundreds of people closely affected by this tragedy that are looking for reasons why it happened. Perhaps an interim report is now overdue?

  How do we know this? As far as I can find, the only direct quote of an official on the content of the MayDay call was from a week ago, when it was reported that the Captain was flying the aircraft, and called only "MayDay, MayDay". Also that there was no response from the aircraft to ATC calls after that.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It may be a moot point, given that one of the videos (from aft as the aircraft takes off) appears to show the jet exhaust cease as the A/C climbs out - 10-11 seconds into the video posted previously showing both rear and side videos side-by-side). To me, it appears as if the engines suddenly throttle down at that point, so I may only be quibbling over what the MayDay actually said.

     Asking because if there is official confirmation that the captain was the pilot flying, as well as official confirmation that he was the one who made the mayday call, is that not another clue pointing towards total loss of AC power (as opposed to thrust merely being rolled back to idle)?

  On other Boeing aircraft that are down to emergency power only the number 1 radio functions. It however functions just fine from any crew station. The radio\x92s are not isolated to a specific user. I would be very surprised if the 787 was different.

  VHF L is on emergency power, the EAFR are not ( see

  ). The front EAFR has its own battery (RIPS) for that reason, the back EAFR has not. (The number of 787 events where this mattered is zero so far.)

  Different (older) aircraft, the flight recorders there did not have backup power iirc.

  The equipment on RAT/battery is limited:

   maintenance training
  </a>
  )
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 787 battery fire report says the two recorders are on the left and right 28VDC buses. I don't think those get powered on RAT by the looks of it. I would wager you get whatever is on the 235VAC 'backup bus', plus the captain's and F/O's instrument buses via C1/C2 TRUs. You won't get all of that (like the F/O's screens) because the 787 energises/de-energises specific bits of equipment, not just whole buses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Losing recorder power looks entirely expected.

     SLF Engineer (electrical - not aerospace) so no special knowledge
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Perceived wisdom may be applicable in normal circumstances but not when all the holes line up.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     For example I've seen it quoted many times that the engine FADECs are self powered
     <br/>
     by the engines, the TCMAs-whether part of the FADEC or a separate unit, similarly self contained
     <br/>
     within the engine. The perceived wisdom seems to be that there is no common single fault
     <br/>
     which can take out both engines.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     And yet we're also told that the TCMA function can only function in ground mode and receives ground-air
     <br/>
     signals from a combination of inputs from Rad Alts and WOW sensors.
     <br/>
     There is therefore a connection from the central EE bay to the engine.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Yes I'm sure the Rad/Alt and WOW sensor processing will use different sensors for each side and powered from different
     <br/>
     low voltage buses.
     <br/>
     However as an analogy, in your house your toaster in the kitchen may be on a separate circuit from the water heater in
     <br/>
     the bathroom, each protected by a fuse at the main switchboard. In normal operation a fault in one cannot affect the other.
     <br/>
     However a lightning strike outside the house can send much higher voltages than normal operation throughout the entire
     <br/>
     system and trash every electrical appliance not physically disconnected at the time.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Now I'm not suggesting the aircraft was hit by lightning but FDR has proposed a single event, buildup from a water leak entering
     <br/>
     one of the EE bays at rotate. It would be possible for one or more of the HV electrical buses to short so that all the low voltage
     <br/>
     buses go high voltage. I have no knowledge of how the FADEC / TCMA systems connect to or process the Ground-Air signals but
     <br/>
     there is a single fault mechanism whereby high voltage could be simultaneously and inappropriately applied to both engine control systems.
     <br/>
     It would be unfortunate if this failure mechanism did cause power to be applied to drive the fuel shut off valve closed.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Since the likelihood is that we're looking at a low probability event then perceived wisdom about normal operations and fault modes
     <br/>
     might not be applicable.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  400VAC/540VDC (+-270V) is not really known for blowing past input protection in the same way as actual HV or lightning. I would expect some optocouplers and/or transformers to be both present and adequate. There's definitely some big MOVs scattered around the main 235VAC buses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Weight on wheels appears to go into data concentrators that go into the common core system (i.e. data network).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Presumably there is a set of comms buses between the FADECs and the CCS to allow all the pretty indicators and EICAS alerts in the cockpit to work. The WoW sensors might flow back via that, or via dedicated digital inputs from whatever the reverse of a data concentrator is called (surely they have need for field actuators other than big motors?). Either way, left and right engine data should come from completely different computers, that are in the fwd e/e bay (or concentrators/repeaters in the wings, maybe) rather than in with the big power stuff in the aft e/e bay.
