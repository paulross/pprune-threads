  My first post here...I feel I need to, due to some posts I have read. As a 787 pilot who has flown Embraer, Airbus, 767 and the 787-8/-9, I am saddened by many of the posts on this thread.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some of you should be ashamed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blaming the pilots before anyone has any idea what transpired.Short takeoff, improper flap/no flap setting, retracting the flaps instead of the gear, shutting down the wrong engine. In ANY other situation these actions would be laughable, and an insult to proffessional pilots the world over. Some commenting about the flaps even after pictures have shown that the flaps are extended. Also numerous people posting regarding shutting the wrong engine being shut down without any evidence to back this up. Videos clearly showing that the RAT was extended indicates that something very serious/catastrophic happened prior to this hull loss. People...this is the Proffessional Pilot's Rumour Network...Not the National Enquirer!!! I would urge everyone to WAIT for the report. Unbelievable.

     I got the idea that with no (or very little) thrust, and with the aircraft falling, the pilot (may have) realized that he was in
     <i>
      out of control flight
     </i>
     , and falling.
     <br/>
     In a pedantic sense: if you make control inputs, and the aircraft won't or can't respond to them, you are in
     <i>
      out of control flight
     </i>
     .
     <br/>
     The whole event happened pretty quickly. How far into "we are doomed" that his senses told him they were can have informed his decision to say something about it. (the human mind is an interesting thing).
     <br/>
     There's also the matter of temporal distortion which can happen during stress or high adrenalin events. (I experienced that during the course of an aircraft accident: not on topic for this thread).
     <br/>
     As to conformance with ICAO, not all investigations make good on that.

       On 21 March 2025 (the third anniversary of the accident), the CAAC did not release an annual investigation progress report or a final investigation report,
       <b>
        as required by the Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation and CAAC's own coded regulations
       </b>
       .
       <br/>
       <br/>
       On 19 May 2025, in response to an open government information request, the CAAC said that it decided not to release the interim investigation report to the public because releasing the report might "endanger national security and societal stability".

     </i>
     in commercial transport jargon).
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  A jet upset is an undesirable aircraft state...ie stall, or severe turbulence causing the aircraft to flip upside down dive etc... Looking at the Air India incident, the aircraft was not in any of those situations... In fact, if you weren't aware, you would think it was landing. This is something else entirely.

     Richard Godfrey has completely ignored that fact that the speed was reducing all the way down the descent. He has hypothesised a steady descent angle at around 3.5:1 and therefore concluded that one engine had stopped and the other was on ~10,000lb of thrust because, at the initial speed they needed that thrust to counter the drag. But the AOA clearly increases markedly as the aircraft approaches the ground, which means that the speed was reducing significantly.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     As for statements such as:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     They make me take that whole spiel with a grain of salt.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     In a nutshell, he's saying they had an engine failure before rotation, then got all the way up to 300-odd feet (following what looked to me like an initially standard low-angle/flat 787 takeoff, then ran out of puff and crashed with the other engine running at 15-18% Thrust.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Pure speculation aka WAG.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I agree 100% with your last sentence.

     An "expert" who can't get something as basic as a runway slope calculation anything close to correct doesn't inspire much confidence in his other "analysis".

  Sounds like clickbait to me. I didn't watch the video. I prefer to wait for the actual report.

     On the 767, 757 and A330 anytime you are in single generator operations the aircraft is load shedding. The 787 with a totally different electrical system might function differently.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  The 87 load sheds as well.It's got 4 permanent magnet generators, 2 per engine, along with 2 permanent magnetic alternators, 1 per engine...these power the EECs. A 115v AC bus can power the EECs during startup, and can be used as a backup.

     Obvious questions, Is the procedure applicable to the GEnx engines installed on the accident aircraft and I assume this only applies if you realise the control switches are what the issue is, within seconds?

  Yes, the procedure is the same with the GEnx engines. No difference between the two when it comes to that situation.
