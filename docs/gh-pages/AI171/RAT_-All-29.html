     I suspect both recorders will contain the same data. Given the radio transmission after the loss of thrust the aircraft still had at least the emergency electrical bus powered. This should have kept both recorders online. It is however possible given the 10 minute battery backup that Boeing chose to put the the recorders on another bus but that\x92s not the norm.

  I am not certain on that. Remember the 737 didn't have them on the standby bus (Jeju). The NTSB doc states they're powered from the L/R 28VDC buses on the 787.

  This shows the centre TRUs can only power the instrument buses not the L/R DC buses, the RAT can't really power the right TRU without powering both R1/R2 buses, and powering the left TRU would require powering the left 235/115 ATU which would probably be a lot of magnetising current even if not much actual load. The contactor naming supports that.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  My money is on the L/R DC buses being unpowered in RAT operation; only the CA/FO instrument buses and the 235VAC backup bus.

  That's exactly why I would really recommend reading through the NTSB FDR report on the 2013 JA829J Boston incident helpfully posted by

  . There's potentially a wealth of data concerning a to me at least surprisingly number of 2000 of parameters written on a 787 EAFR, that is that at least if there's elec power. Even the 10 min RIPS is useless if there's no data sent from electrically shut off systems.

     NYT illustrated the story, drawing the same conclusions as this thread so far:
     <br/>
     <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/06/27/world/asia/air-india-crash-cause.html" target="_blank">
      https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/...ash-cause.html
     </a>
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Article seemed quite objective and avoided speculation of the cause. But the audio they included of the airliner flying overhead with RAT deployed seemed to be from the older video of another 787 where RAT was confirmed out rather than from the actual Ahmedabad crash footage?

  An admittedly approximate assessment of the airplane's lift-over-drag capability, considering other conditions (head wind, ground effect, actual airspeed vs that required to maximize L/D, etc.) suggests that the engines were providing some thrust in order for it to get as far as it did. Note that simple calculations based on conversion of energy, e.g. velocity and height, to distance are even more approximate in this scenario.

  I guess that that would not normally match the assumption that the generators disconnected (all four) and activated the RAT?

  Some thrust from idle and up would normally keep generators online.

  Thanks but I want to separate the RAT issue from the engines/thrust issue.
  <br/>
  Its possible that the RAT was deployed for other reasons, prior to the engines losing thrust. So, leaving the RAT out of the equation for a bit, do we think there is a sound of engines TRYING to run?

  Also note that either member of the crew can deploy the RAT in addition to the automatic modes, conceivably preemptively in response to the engines losing thrust (full disclosure: at least one poster has insisted than no competent crew would ever do that in those circumstances given the multiple actions with a higher priority to be taken). Others may know if their preferred scenario explaining the simultaneous loss of thrust and automatic RAT deployment could have then resulted in the engines recovering but not soon enough to stop the descent.
