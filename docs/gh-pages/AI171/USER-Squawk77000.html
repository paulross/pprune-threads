  How could the CVR have been "read out" if the CVR hasn't yet been located?

     I was struck by a comment in this or the earlier thread that I cannot now find. It was to the effect \x96 I\x92m paraphrasing \x96 that fuel shut off results in an almost immediate cessation of thrust.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Spot on, there's so much fuel being sucked at that power setting, it would be super quick and presumably at near enough to the exact same time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I assume (rightly so) that you're focused on what could cause them to fail at what appears to be the exact same time given the absence of yaw and any correcting rudder input.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One the face of it, it could only be throttle or fuel supply, with fuel supply only being able to be cut off by valves so abruptly.  Any kind of blockage or similar wouldn't give such a result, even if there was a low fuel condition, short of the pickups being exactly right next to each other, presumably that wouldn't give the outcome we've seen.

     The gag rule is pretty much the first thing you're told when you get drawn into an investigation - and you can get in big trouble for violating it (even if inadvertent).
     <br/>
     A Boeing management type got his hand slapped pretty hard not to long ago when he made the mistake of answering a reporter's question regarding the Alaska door plug blowout.
     <br/>
     I was tempted to contact my friend who was my counterpart during the 787/GEnx-1B development, but I suspect he's already been contacted and is considered to be part of the investigation - so he couldn't talk to me about it anyway.

  I wouldn't read anything at all into it, as it appeared on a single online news article from some low-budget unknown news source.

  There was talk back then that Boeing were going to cop the costs for this moving forward, however [I believe] that it's still dependent on the operator to pay the Imarsat sub.

  I haven't read anywhere where the yaw to the right was noticed not that long after takeoff? I'm assuming this was due to the roll-back.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  About 9 seconds after wheels-up it's clear that power is well and truly deminishing.
  <br/>
  17 seconds after wheels-up, there's a defined yaw to the right.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It looks like the right engine power is lost, a yaw to the right occurs and immediately after, the aircraft pitches up, potentially due to elevator input and subsequently some left rudder. It gives some credit to the theory that one engine was lost.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I can only assume that the associated yaw from a lost engine would be significant, so on the face of it, it doesn't look severe enough, but it does look somewhat upset.

     Maybe both engines didn't shut down absolutely sychronously. In the fly-by video a bit later not even a little bit asymmetry is visible. The rudder is straight and no bank whatsoever. That would also explain why the yaw is very small - a second later the other engine had failed as well.

     2. Put 200' as the altitude target in the FCU. Immediate ALT capture and all the power comes off. PF is still hand flying trying to increase pitch but is already way behind the aircraft.

   </div>
  </div>
  I fear you might be onto something here.  How quickly would the power drop off in this circumstance?

  Is the cleared altitude available from the ATC tapes and could it have been 2,000 or 20,000 perhaps?

     Not saying at all that is what happened here. Just interested in the logic.

  Software is all about logic and impossible to predict, as seem with the MCAS issues coded by an offshore company and not thoroughly checked or fully understood by those that commissioned the code.

  I lost my pitot input on my last flight and my auto-pilot started a set of uncontrolled pitches, so I disabled and hand flew.  I would have never expected that behaviour.  It has a speed tolerance with minimum speed, however it was nowhere near that threshold.

     There are numerous pictures ot the outside of B787 centre tanks on the net. Does anyone one have any internal pictures, showing the tank floor and fuel pump pick ups?
     <br/>
     We know the engines lost power in the initial climb, shortly after rotation. If there was water sitting between the tank lower skin stringers, the rotation would have been the point that the water could tumble over the stringers that were previously preventing its movement. accumulate at the back of the tank and enter both pumps more or less simultaneously.
     <br/>
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I had been wondering the same until I read that there is a forward and a rear pickup within the tank. Each pump in the centre tank draws from it's own pickup and is piped to the spar valves and then onto the engines.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a well designed boat, you'd have each engine feeding from a different tank for the utmost in redundancy, but seemingly not so in all aircraft.

     Interestingly enough on Airbus aircraft even when there\x92s fuel in the centre tank the centre tank fuel pumps are switched off automatically after the flaps are extended for takeoff and each engine is fed by its respective wing tank for takeoff. Surprised it\x92s not the case for Boeings
    </div>
   </div>

  Don't get me wrong, I'm not suggesting for even a moment that Boeing don't do the same thing; I have no idea.  I was merely pointing out how the centre tank feeds when it does.
