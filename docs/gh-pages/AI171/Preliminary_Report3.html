  Nothing in the report suggests that the engines began to run down before the fuel was selected to cutoff. The report states a sequence of events for power loss which
  <i>
   begins
  </i>
  with the switches being moved to cutoff. The maximum airspeed was immediately before the switches were moved, so there had not been a power rundown prior to that:

       Why are we concentrating on the engine switches .?

    The AAIB clearly pulled the N2 data at least out of the EAFR. There is no indication that the engines were operating abnormally prior to being switched off. We also see this:

  This is a preliminary report. It is quite detailed for a preliminary report.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Examining the before-takeoff checklists seems like it would be akin to examining the re-arrangement of the deckchairs before the titanic even hit the iceberg.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The engines were switched off. Unlike Embraer, B &amp; A have no protections stopping you switching an engine off inadvertently. From everything in the report, everything operated exactly as designed. I am not certain of how long the relight window is without windmilling speed, but +- 10 seconds seems entirely reasonable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The outstanding question that presumably requires much more in-depth investigation of the wreckage items and CVR audio is whether:
  <ul>
   <li>
    the cutoff switches were operated deliberately (and by who)
   </li>
   <li>
    the cutoff switches were operated inadvertently (and by who)
   </li>
   <li>
    the cutoff switches were bumped (by what) and the guards failed or weren't installed
   </li>
   <li>
    some electrical failure perfectly mimicked both many-pole switches being operated, then being operated again (seems unlikely)
   </li>
  </ul>

     I'm bewildered by the descriptions of the toggle switches. 'Lifting' is not the terminology I've lived with. The knob is pulled out so that the detents in the inner end of the knob can move over the sharp ridges on the switch body. A minor point, but what is not so minor is the inference that these detents and ridges are a safety design that is sometimes not installed. Surely, they must be talking about some further mechanism, or am I in the twilight zone? I cannot believe there's an aircraft with simple smooth action between off and on, an over-centre toggle . . . that will stop the engines!
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  The Service Bulletin (link below) referenced on page 6 of the preliminary report describes just that...fuel control switches without detents or what the bulletin describes as a "locking feature" that can be "disengaged" and still allow the switch to function. It's somewhat of a glaring omission that the report did not state the status (detent or not) of the switches on this aircraft. Presumably if no-detent switches were found then an emergency AD would already have been issued.

  Wouldn't they already know if the detents were missing in this case? They recovered the switches and told us what position they were in at impact.

     I'll leave the CVR extracts to those who want to run down that rat-hole, but WHO was flying and WHO was (doing all else) begins to matter.
     <br/>
     Do any of you actually know who was PF and who was PM?
     <br/>
     If you know that, how do you know that?

     I wonder if the scenario could be that the accident crew received a Stabiliser EICAS message on or around take-off and the Capt (who was PM) decided to action the first checklist item immediately from memory, by intending to move the Stab switches to Cutoff but moving the fuel switches instead.

  If there was some kind of Stabiliser error message during the timeline of this accident it would certainly be mentioned in the preliminary report. I am sure that the investigators would have noted it and arrived to similar conclusion you did. A Stabiliser error message would be too relevant piece of information to ignore it in the preliminary report.

  I hope this isn't too far off-topic, but a question raised a few times in the days after the crash was why we only had cell-phone video and foreshortened security camera footage from buildings near the airport. Why didn't the airport save 4K video of every takeoff? (I think this came up for Jeju too.)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The preliminary report includes a hi-res image of the aircraft shortly after takeoff. The airport _had_ good video. I would guess many do, and in this case the investigation team thought it was useful to release a still from it.

  Thanks for your comment. Agreed, but why did the report make mention of the Stabiliser fault on the previous sector? If this is completely irrelevant, why was it mentioned at all? There a quite a few specifics that are missing from this initial report, such as specific CVR information (what was actually said by the pilots). The report also says "...The EAFR data downloaded from forward EAFR is being analyzed in detail..." This indicates that more is known than is in the report. I suspect that the initial report was put out to meet the "30 day rule" and there will be further interim reports before the final.

     I just looked at a picture of the 787 throttle area and I don't see how one would ever confuse the stabilizer cutout switches with the engine fuel cutoff switches. They are completely different in look and feel and operation........Also, what is the supposed startling event here?
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Um, the flap and gear levers are a totally different design and they look, feel, operate differently. They are not even co-located, and occasionally people confuse them, withstanding decades of design efforts.
  <br/>
  The fact that EICAS messages were recorded does not mean that they were provided in the preliminary report.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The notion is that around liftoff EICAS reported an error related to an error logged on the previous flight, that the PM felt it prudent to remedy the problem by cutting the stab cutoff switches, inadvertently cutting fuel. Action-slip, as mentioned countless times in these threads.

  Really? It suggests to me and I would imagine the vast majority of us who have flown modern Boeings that they were physically moved, by one of the crew, one at a time, the question is why.

  The accident aircraft was written up for a status message of &rdquo;STAB POS XDCR&rdquo; on the previous flight, which is a message relating to implausible data from the stab trim switches. It was released from maintenance (according to the preliminary report) at 06:40UTC ahead of an 07:40UTC departure (the crash flight) with &rdquo;no fault found&rdquo;.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the 787-8, as all modern planes, switches are not cabled as dry closing contacts all the way from the switch poles to the affected end devices (FADECs in the case of fuel cutoff switches), but rather connect locally to an analogue/digital converter to encode the switch position data onto the digital comms bus ARINC629 which allows all aircraft systems to talk to one another.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Are the fuel cutoff switches, which are positioned adjacent to the stab trim switches, connected to the same ADC module which produced the error message on the previous flight, which maintenance was unable to resolve before the accident flight took off?  I do not know, but it must be worthy of being looked into.

     (Admin/Mod)Folks, it appears that the message isn't getting through.
     <br/>
     There were two professional pilots on that flight deck.
     <br/>
     It is not acceptable to effectively accuse
     <u>
      <b>
       both
      </b>
     </u>
     of a criminal act, because there is no evidence to identify which hand -
     <u>
      <b>
       if either
      </b>
     </u>
     - moved the fuel switches, or for what purpose or reason.
     <br/>
     Unless and until any such evidence is published by the relevant authorities, kindly desist from doing so out of respect for your professional colleagues.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  The Mods have stuck to this principle, which I shall try to adhere to.
  <br/>
  This preliminary report is just that, but maybe consider the issues the Indian AAIB have had to address in publishing it. They will have a similar concern to the pP mods, maybe more so since any apparent accusations directed at the pilots may lead to physical retribution.
  <br/>
  I therefore conclude great care has been taken to "sanitise" what the AAIB know, or at least strongly suspect, (from EAFR) into the report. They have conspicuously failed to identify which of the pilots was each half of the conversation they have not repeated the exact words, there's a lot missing (was positive rate ever called, was rotate ever called, any discussion about putting FC back to Run, who/how flying aircraft meanwhile). As a result we, the reader, should step back and not over-interpret this sanitised report.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Secondly, given the mod statement above,
  <b>
   <u>
    if
   </u>
  </b>
  a criminal act is suspected by the AAIB, this will likely trigger all sorts of 'primacy' issues in the investigation i.e. police? AAIB? or joint? and all the history that involves (SAS Linate?) - in Europe we have 996-2010 Article 12 para 2, but India?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <b>
   Summary
  </b>
  : For good reason I believe this report has been very carefully worded, sanitised with great care, and as such easy to inappropriately speculate what went on.

     From the report, there is no indicated time stamp identifying the point when one pilot asked the other "why did you cut off"
     <br/>
     This could explain the the assumption that it took ten seconds to reverse the switch positions.
     <br/>
     Cut off could have been noticed at any point later than 08:08:42 but before 08:08:52.

  From my reading of the AAIB report, the delay in noticing the cut off switch position could not have been any later than 08:08:47 because the reference to the verbal exchange was written before the reference to the RAT deployment and I assume the written narrative follows the chronological sequence of events.  The delay in resetting those fuel switches might therefore have been no more than 5 seconds.  It is a pity that the pilot making the challenge didn't simply reset the switches to run instead of challenging the other pilot.  I frequently tell people who blow their horns at pedestrians or other motorists that blowing the horn isn't going to help them avoid an accident and that what they really need to do in the limited time available to them is concentrate on applying the brakes and turning the steering wheel.

  May I ask where you found the "no fault found" info? I can't see that, though I suspected it.

     As someone suggested, the person asking the question might have asked it to cover the fact that he had performed the action.

   </div>

  That will be easily answered when investigators play CVR recordings to colleagues, family and friends who can recognise and identify the voices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They probably know that answer but it is omitted from preliminary report.
