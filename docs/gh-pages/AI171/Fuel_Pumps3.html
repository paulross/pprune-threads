     Retired engineer here. Following my post a while ago on the avionics electrical system I have read all the posts and also noticed mention of the hydraulics system.
     <br/>
     Returning to my original source, which is
     <span style="color:#000000">
      Book 1 Introduction to B787 Avionic/Electrical, I read on p. 96 that the RAT will deploy if any of three condions are met.
      <br/>
      Maybe the URL will work this time
     </span>
     <br/>
     <a href="https://fliphtml5.com/quwam/qhdw/Book_1_-_Introduction_to_B787_Avionics_Electrical" target="_blank">
      https://fliphtml5.com/quwam/qhdw/Boo...ics_Electrical
     </a>
     <br/>
     <span style="color:#000000">
      These conditions for deployment of the RAT specifically are:
      <br/>
      Loss of both engines
      <br/>
      Loss of power to the instrument buses
      <br/>
      Loss of all three hydraulic systems
      <br/>
      <br/>
      The latter one may be worth a close look because it would appear that problems took place when the wheels left the runway and I assume there was a change of states in various sensors. I surmise these sensors are different from the engine systems where both commands and power are needed to force a change of state in, say, fuel pumps. Is it the same for thrust control?
      <br/>
      It says there are three hydraulic systems but is there a common reservoir? I'm not an expert in that field but google tells me that B787 has a bootstrap reservoir system which I understand to mean that a pressure of 5000 psi is maintained using a piston arrangement.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      At this point think timeline, and changes of states.
      <br/>
      There is an operational change when the wheels leave the ground. The associated sensors would send that data to the CCS. What was sent? Maybe the CCS read Hydraulic L + Hydraulic R + Hydraulic C = incorrect or fail, which would trigger deployment of the RAT. What would the electrical and control system do then? More importantly what exactly did all the systems do on this aircraft following such an event.
      <br/>
      Was there a problem with the fluid in the hydraulics? Does hydraulic fluid ever 'go off' in very hot conditions. Or maybe there wasn't as much fluid in there than there should have been? How would hydraulics systems be compromised if indeed that was the case.
      <br/>
      All speculation - but forensic system analysis is a bit like that
     </span>
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Three hydraulic systems, each with their own reservoir, pumps, and accumulators. Engine bleed air (I think; some newer aircraft have a semi-permanent nitrogen charge) keeps a few tens of PSI of positive pressure in the reservoir to prevent pump cavitation; loss of this is not an emergency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Left and right hydraulics have an engine driven pump that will keep turning as long as the engine is turning unless explicitly disabled.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Low reservoir levels are both a maintenance check and something that will raise an EICAS warning.

     There are a few comments along the lines of "it is incredibly unlikely that..." this is selection bias in reverse. Something incredibly unlikely
     <b>
      has
     </b>
     happened, and it's contained in this sample set.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     To summarise some known facts about the TCMA system:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     1) TCMA will shut down an engine if:
     <ul>
      <li>
       It believes via multiple redundant sensors indicate the aircraft is on the ground
      </li>
      <li>
       It detects engine power in excess of that set by the thrust levers - subject to a margin to account for engine performance variation - that is determined to be a runaway condition
      </li>
     </ul>
     2) In 2019 an ANA pilot was able to confuse the TCMA by rapidly moving the thrust levers into reverse, to forward and back into reverse again. This caused both engines to shutdown.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     3) Since then the TCMA should have been updated/fixed (and indeed the software will have been updated by SB since the a/c was delivered, to detect a wider range of runaway conditions)
     <br/>
     <br/>
     And speculation:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     4) It may be possible - given the close timings - that a TCMA activation occurred as the a/c was leaving the ground, with kinetic energy and spool down time getting the a/c from the ground to its peak height
     <br/>
     <br/>
     In the recent BA LGW incident the PF reduced thrust to idle at V1, then added thrust back, then committed to a RTO. I wonder if something similar could have occurred:
     <ul>
      <li>
       In error, PF reduces power to idle at a speed approaching V1
      </li>
      <li>
       Engines begin reducing power, but n1 reduces more slowly than the TCMA system is expecting (perhaps because the TCMA margin is calculated when the a/c is stationary, but at 170kt a turbofan will spool down more slowly due to the ram air / windmill effect)
      </li>
      <li>
       TCMA detects a runaway condition - while a/c is on the ground - and cuts off fuel via the relay circuit
      </li>
      <li>
       PF decides to commit to takeoff and rotates, not knowing that TCMA has already activated
      </li>
      <li>
       10-15s after rotation, n1 has now dropped below minimums for electrical generation. Electrics fail, final transponder signal is sent, and RAT is deployed
      </li>
     </ul>
     Obviously this should not be possible, and there are other possibilities.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  If TCMA cut fuel flow while still on the runway the aircraft would have been decelerating from the moment it lifted off, which is not what the ADS-B data indicates. The kinetic energy in the rotating parts of the engine wouldn't add much speed to the aircraft as the engines run down with no more energy being added via fuel.

     It could do it, assuming fuses/contactors didn't vapourise first.
     <br>
      <br>
       I expect the VFSG shafts would be designed to fuse/slip long before the main radial shaft feeding the gearbox, as noted.
       <br>
        <br>
         But if it occurred, it would knock out not just your FADEC alternator but also the high pressure fuel pumps. Engine would stop dead near instantly.
         <br>
          <br>
           It would partly be a question of how much interlocking is present. I guess bypassing/mis-adjusting mechanical interlocks is something poor maintenance could &amp; would do.

  I have been really wondering what single point of failure could take out both engines simultaneously as seems to be the case here. One single main bus contactor closing in error seems to possibly be such a single point fault.
  <br>
   Online/running generators connected together by accident/fault will cause a HUGE load on everything, electric connections, generator itself and the shafts and gears driving the generators. Heck, I wouldnt be surprised if the generator could disintegrate due to such an electromagnetic shock load.
   <br/>
   So, the question is if there is something between the generators that could limit the electric current. A VFD possibly would as the VFD maybe would not be able to pass the current required for shearing the drive shaft for example. But then again, electronic switches like IGBT/MOSFET and such are able to pass an incredibly large over current for some milliseconds before exploding. Possibly 50 to 100 times the nominal current. So I am not sure if a VFD really would save the rest of the system in a situation with two generators connected together in error.
   <br/>
   So, where is the VFD part installed, directly on each generator or somewhere else in the system? Are there physical interlocks on the contactors or only electric interlocks?

     A flight test (at least one - it's often duplicated) is performed as a basic part of aircraft/engine certification. One engine with all boost pumps off and on 'suction' feed - the other engine with normal aircraft boost pump operation (for what should be obvious reasons). Start, taxi, takeoff, and climb in that configuration until the test engine quits due to fuel starvation as a result of the engine fuel pump cavitation (done using "unweathered" fuel - once fuel has been at altitude for a period of time (hours or more - i.e. 'weathered'), most of the dissolved gases in the fuel have vented off, and suction feed works far better - often up to cruise altitudes).
     <br/>
     I don't think this test is ever done during normal operations or maintenance (at least not on purpose) as it is
     <i>
      very
     </i>
     abusive to the engine driven fuel pump - the sort of cavitation that this causes rapidly erodes the pumping surfaces (it's SOP to replace the engine driven fuel pump after such a test).
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  This is a regular test during maintenance at my airline (British operator of 787s)
  <br/>
  Carried out as part of a 12k check.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fuel level in the wing tanks made to be between 3100 kg &amp; 3400kg. Engines are started, APU shut down and boost pumps are selected off.
  <br/>
  As long as the engines keep running, it\x92s test passed. (Just have to remember to fire the APU back up before shutting the engines down!)

  Seems to be funny that no-one has mentioned the Battery, which because of its age could have failed either Short-circuit or Open-circuit.
  <br/>
  Maybe some Boeing Electro Techs, could explain what role the battery has in this circumstance.
  <br/>
  The simultaneous failure of both engines points towards an electrical problem, unless the high temperature had adversely affected the fuel flow.

     Sorry I am not a pilot but I did spend three years filming a TV series at Boeing for pBS/Channel 4 about the design and construction of the 777, and my response is not a technical one anyway. Do airfields have high definition video coverage of all takeoffs and landings? If so, they should be public domain and there would not be hundreds of posts about grainy over-magnified smartphone footage. If they don't, a 6-cam setup on each runway (3 either side of runway, one back, one across and one forward) could record continuously to hard disk or cloud. If airfields don't have this, shouldn't it be made mandatory?

  We'd need to know the impedance/available fault current of the generators. 50x would be unusually high in an industrial setting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  VFDs are for frequency conversion to drive the motors (CAC/pumps/engine start). They won't be carrying the full generator load for galleys and anti-ice; that will be handled by cross-ties, which is a big black box on the 787.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fast fuses can be faster acting than circuit breakers, but are one-shot. I'm not sure how fast-acting and effective the generator contactors/controllers are; conventional ACBs/MCCBs will blow open magnetically under sufficient fault current regardless of what the trip unit or close coil commands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I wouldn't really expect electrical reconfiguration to happen on climbout, and I wouldn't expect it to be the first time this contactor gets used since maintenance - everything should get a good workout during sequential APU/engine starts.

     No system would be designed to parallel two frequency wild generators. The output from each would be rectified to dc and conditioned before application to the load, but could be paralleled at dc level if required for redundancy. These are quarter megawatt generators, where an out of phase connection could shear drive shafts, destroy the drive train, or worse.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Not designed to parallel, but you still need to switch each generator on/off buses and tie or separate buses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a very simple main-tie-main arrangement you can close any two of three breakers and still keep the sources separate. It gets much more complicated when you have ten different sources.
  <br/>

  I suspect the 'large motor power centre'

  parallel the rectified output of some generators.

     I no longer believe in the no flaps / flaps raised early theory.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I think this was a major electrical failure most likely due to the engines quitting.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The 787 is far more heavily dependent on electrical power to run it's systems than previous Boeing planes.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     It requires about 1.5 megawatts of power according to Wiki. 5X more than previous designs.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Things that were done by engine driven pumps/compressors and engine bleed air are all done electrically on the 787.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Flight controls that were moved hydraulically or pneumatically are moved by electric actuators. Etc.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  The 787 flight controls remain almost entirely hydraulic except for stab trim and two spoiler pairs. The centre system is now electric- or RAT-only with no ADP backup. Left and Right systems are still driven by EDPs and will remain pressurised as long as there's fluid and the engines turn.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  1.5MW is the figure for all six generators; only four can be used at once.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There's no indication they had any flight control issues.

     Seems to be funny that no-one has mentioned the Battery, which because of its age could have failed either Short-circuit or Open-circuit.
     <br/>
     Maybe some Boeing Electro Techs, could explain what role the battery has in this circumstance.
     <br/>
     The simultaneous failure of both engines points towards an electrical problem, unless the high temperature had adversely affected the fuel flow.

  Battery is essentially unused in normal operations other than to start the APU and keep the clocks running. It's there for emergencies (like

     As I've posted several times, in this business you 'never say never' - but the chances that
     <i>
      both
     </i>
     engines fuel pumps were deteriorated to the point where they could not adequately provide suction feed fuel to keep the engines running is very, very remote.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  OK I can accept that two bad pumps are unlikely but what I originally wanted to know was when the suction-feed system--as a whole--is ever tested.  Your answer as I understand it is effectively "never".  So then I'd ask what other parts of the system are there--check valves, tubes, fittings etc--that have to work properly in order to get fuel to the engines without electric pumps?  The engines are lower than the tanks so it really is suction-augmented gravity feed, but are there any points where a leak could air-lock the system?  Is the fuel feed to the pumps via a standpipe going through the bottom of the tank or via a loop that enters from the top of the tank?  There have been cases before where mechanics have systemically misassembled things.

  Can anyone help with my theory - I'm an electronics and software engineer, but not a pilot.
  <br/>
  My understanding of the infamous and previously fixed 787 issue was that the PCU software would trigger a shutdown of
  <b>
   all
  </b>
  AC generators (or rather their respective control units) after 248 days of continuous power due to an overflow of a software counter, and that this was fixed in software alone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <b>
   Hypothetically
  </b>
  , if the PCU software triggered this state during takeoff, what would happen? I know the engines may continue running with engine-driven fuel pumps, but I also understand this doesn't work in all situations and perhaps during rotation with a high fuel demand and fuel tanks not horizontal this could be an issue? What does everyone here think it would look like if all AC generators were shut down, in terms of engine performance - would you expect there to be a reduction in thrust? With the gear stuck down would that be serious enough?

     I think it needs to be said again that pretty much anything can happen to the aircraft systems and the engines will carry on running - this is by design as they have independent FADEC and power supplies and at sea level fuel will get through without boost pumps. You could almost saw the wing off the fuselage and the engine would still produce thrust, TCMA notwithstanding.

  Firstly, I've read through this whole thread - thank you Admin &amp; Mods for your considerable efforts to clean things up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Secondly, as a (now ex) glider pilot who remains extremely interested in aviation in most of its forms, this discussion has been an education and thought-provoking, as it so frequently is whenever I lurk here (usually without logging in). Thank you all for sharing your knowledge, expertise and thoughts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To my mind the above post (especially the sentence I highlighted) is amongst the best (and most succinct) summary of what the pilots likely faced, with little to no time to resolve the situation. I cannot imagine those last few seconds and my heart goes out to them, the passengers and the many loved ones left behind. If there is any good that can come of this, it is that the cause is found quickly, with no bias, and steps are taken to ensure the same holes in the cheese cannot happen again.

      When we see the video, the airplane is still climbing / flying straight and level (not losing altitude), yet we hear what we think might be the RAT, I can't imagine that they had the kinetic energy to do this with no engines. if they had dual engine failure, they would have been a brick, Hot and High, no thrust, flaps 5, zero chance.
     </span>
    </div>
   </div>

  How long does it take for an engine to fail in terms of thrust output - what does thrust over time look like for various failure scenarios - e.g., no electrically powered fuel pumps, or contaminated fuel, or thrust set to idle or other issues?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The original mobile video (not the copy from someones phone screen) clearly sounds like a RAT but what does the engine itself sound like - is it idle or reduced in some way?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  What is the minimum amount of thrust that would need to be lost to stop climbing and sink back down - it took 30 seconds from leaving the ground to impact from the CCTV and the first 15 was climbing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I would look carefully at the fact that the PCU still has the technical ability to tell all AC generator control units to turn off via software, as proven in the documented and fixed 248-day software issue.

     As I've noted previously, a complete loss of aircraft electrical power would not cause the engines to flameout (or even lose meaningful thrust) during takeoff. In the takeoff altitude envelope, 'suction feed' (I think Airbus calls it 'gravity feed') is more than sufficient to supply the engine driven fuel pumps. It's only when you get up to ~20k ft. that suction feed can become an issue - and this event happened near sea level.
    </div>

  Voltage fluctuation can have very nasty effects on electronics and sensors. There is a hacking technique called "voltage glitching" which makes use of these effects to trick electronics in states they are not designed for and never supposed to be.
  <br/>
  So I wouldn't vouch for the FADECs if there was catastrophic problem with the power distribution in the aircraft.

     We agree that there was a lack of thrust. Possibly caused by a dual engine failure. But the sharpest frames in the video do NOT show the RAT and this is counter evidence to the RAT theory. If there were substantial technical failures who knows what sounds could be generated. I find the evidence weak at best. And we immediately get into a chicken-egg problem: did some power issue of unknown nature cause an engine failure or did a dual engine failure occur, resulting in a power loss? Both are extremely unlikely and need to be backed by quality evidence. The video is not it, in my opinion. I don't know the APU intake mechanism and whether it could open after the impact.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  To simplify the chicken/egg:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tdracer earlier confirmed that an airplane electrical power loss would allow engines to keep running , because 1) engines are fully-capable of suction feed operation in takeoff envelope (if boost pumps lost), and 2) the EECs are powered by their own PMAs when running and to substantially below idle (I recall roughly 10% N2).  Airplane powers the EEC for ground starts, prior to PMA coming online, and as backup to the PMA after that.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Related:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Engine igniters are powered by the aircraft. So theoretical full loss of aircraft power would disable Autorelight upon a flameout. Ignitors typically don't make the cut for most-essential battery-only loads because it would also take an engine flameout, and the airplane past V1 in ground roll can fly fine on one engine that can achieve takeoff thrust.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Autorelight is relevant - if there was a single-engine failure post V1, autorelight will attempt to relight the engine, so there is no need for a pilot to try to cycle the fuel switch to reset the EEC (potentially grabbing the wrong one), or to otherwise intervene. In such a circumstance, they need to trust their training. I've heard accounts that the most likely pilot instinct in such a situation would be to push the throttle(s) forward.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Finally - there was talk earlier about accidentally cutting the fuel switches - and it was duly noted that they have to be pulled out over the detent, so very unlikely.  The same cutoff effect could be achieved with the engine fire handle(s), right behind the fuel switches on the pedestal - though they are an upward pull, so also not subject to inadvertent or accidental engagement.

  It is similar to the 248-day continuous power software bug on the 787. In both cases a counter in the software would overflow after an amount of time that would be proportional to something like the number of seconds, milliseconds or other unit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 248 day bug would cause the PCU to trigger
  <b>
   ALL 4 AC generator control units
  </b>
  to shut down. The fact that this is even possible in software alone is remarkable and should make any engineer concerned. The fact that this was only fixed in software with no redundant physical system (e.g. 1 or more AC units being independent of this system) is concerning. The fact that Boeing had a second software overflow error causing the 51 day directive should really have everyone discussing software as a possible cause for this crash.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  People may say that the engine driven pumps / suction feed / gravity feed would continue to power the engines but my understanding is the aircraft attitude and high fuel flow at takeoff could potentially mean less thrust than was needed if all 4 AC generators disconnected and stopped all AC fuel pumps during rotation.

     Water ingress into the E/E bay is a serious issue. The B744 had this issue in the past causing serious problems, one of which was fortunate to not lead to a loss of the aircraft, on a B744F. The B744 pax aircraft had a number of water problems related to the toilets and the galley. The forward galley on the B742/3s had many issues.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Any large aircraft going through maintenance is interesting to observe the extent of corrosion that occurs near toilets and galleys, and from water lines.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Water accumulations on the B744 came to light at rotate, and took out a lot of electrical services.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     My suspicion is some cause such as this will come to light shortly.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Both of the E/E bays contain stuff that is nice to keep dry and operating, and prior events have shown that multiple system failures can and have occurred when a flood is added to all the black boxes sitting innocently on their racks.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The ADs are not necessarily directly related to the specific cause, they highlight the potential for water damage and that bad stuff happens. In two cases I investigated, the event occurred at rotate. Both were B744's one pax, one F.

     Compound, unrelated system failures at rotate? Single cause? Water in the E/E bay.

  AD 2016-14-04 mirrors precisely what occurred to the Qantas 747 on 7 January 2008. It is possible something similar may have occurred on take-off of AI171, with water causing the equipment in the EE bays to become wet resulting in electrical short and potential loss of system functions

     If TCMA cut fuel flow while still on the runway the aircraft would have been decelerating from the moment it lifted off, which is not what the ADS-B data indicates. The kinetic energy in the rotating parts of the engine wouldn't add much speed to the aircraft as the engines run down with no more energy being added via fuel.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I was not aware that we have granular ADS-B data from the a/c itself showing airspeed post rotation (rather than speed interpolated from GPS). Apologies if I have missed it. If it does show acceleration after takeoff I tend to agree with you.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In no particular order, here are some more thoughts on TCMA having caught up on the thread:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If you cut the fuel from two big engines at take-off power, there must be some delay before n2 decays below the threshold for generation (below idle n2), the generators disconnect and RAT deploys. GEnx have relatively long spool up/down times as the fan is so large (and would be exposed to 170+kts of ram air). Perhaps someone has a view on how long this would be, but I imagine it could easily be 10s or more between fuel cut off and RAT deployment. On AI171 the RAT appears to be already deployed at the beginning of the bystander video. That starts c. 13s before impact and around 17s after rotation. This does not prove anything except that the supposed shut down must have happened very close to rotation and
  <u>
   could
  </u>
  have happened just before rotation while the a/c was on the ground.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As a thought experiment, imagine if ANA985 in 2019 had decided to go around. The a/c rotates and is ~50 ft above the runway, suddenly both engines spooling down, very little runway left to land on and no reverse thrust available. I am struck by how similar this scenario is to AI171. This theory would require there to have been unexpected thrust lever movement in the moments before rotation - but plausibly one pilot moving to reject, followed by an overrule or change of heart - or even a simple human error such as the recent BA incident at LGW - could achieve this. This is perhaps more likely that any sensor fault that you would expect to only impact a single engine given the redundancy of systems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tdracer writes that a key requirement of TCMA is to identify an engine runaway in the event of an RTO, in order to allow the a/c to stop on the runway. This will have been tested extensively - it is a big leap to imagine a false activation could be triggered. It did happen on ANA985 but through a very unusual set of inputs including application of reverse (albeit this latter point may not be relevant if TCMA logic does not distinguish between the reverser being deployed or not).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Incidentally there is an assumption the TCMA software version in place on the ANA flight had already been patched and fixed on AI171. That probably is the case but I am not sure it is a known fact.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In summary I remain baffled by this tragic accident. I have not yet read anything that explicitly rules out TCMA activation and it remains a possibility due to the vanishingly small number of factors that could shut down two engines at apparently the exact same moment when they have fully redundant systems. Fuel contamination, for example, has typically impacted each engine a few minutes (at least) apart. I am also cautious (as others have pointed out) of a form of confirmation bias about Boeing software systems with four-letter acronyms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In my mind the cause could equally well be something completely different to anything suggested on this thread, that will only become clear with more evidence. All of the above also incorporates a number of theories, i.e. that there was an engine shutdown - that are not conclusively known.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thank you to the mods for an excellent job.

     With the information we have accumulated so far, is the following a possible scenario? Normal departure up to VR, then a total electrical failure at lift off (possibly as the ground/air logic switches to air.) All hydraulics lost and cabin lights flicker plus RAT deploys. All fuel boost pumps fail so engines only have suction feed. Engines roll back. The aircraft seems to me to have gone too far to have suffered a total loss of thrust at lift off. There must have been some energy being provided by the engines? Such a system failure "can't happen", of course but nothing is impossible!
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  What you are saying is, as several have said before, is that everything started to fail at or shortly before rotation. Joining the dots from two other branches in this thread is it correct to say that there are only two things that happen at that point: the aircraft transitions from "ground" to "air" (multiple sensors) and there is a change in orientation such that any liquid (eg potable water) that has found its way into the EE bay will move. Question: the aircraft was routed DEL-AMD-LGW. Where was the potable water tankage topped up? Presumably prior to the longest sector? In addition to the inspection list that the Indian AAIB has mandated should they also inspect peer aircraft for EE bay corrosion...?

  Another hour spent sifting through the stuff since last night (my sympathies to the mods
  <img alt="" border="0" class="inlineimg" src="https://www.pprune.org/images/smilies/worry.gif" title="Uh oh"/>
  ). A few more comments:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Real time engine monitoring" is typically not 'real time' - it's recorded and sent in periodic bursts. Very unlikely anything was sent from the event aircraft on this flight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Commanded engine cutoff - the aisle stand fuel switch sends electrical signals to the spar valve and the "High Pressure Shutoff Valve" (HPSOV) in the Fuel Metering Unit, commanding them to open/close using aircraft power. The HPSOV is solenoid controlled, and near instantaneous. The solenoid is of a 'locking' type that needs to be powered both ways (for obvious reasons, you wouldn't want a loss of electrical power to shut down the engine). The fire handle does the same thing, via different electrical paths (i.e. separate wiring).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As I've noted previously, a complete loss of aircraft electrical power would not cause the engines to flameout (or even lose meaningful thrust) during takeoff. In the takeoff altitude envelope, 'suction feed' (I think Airbus calls it 'gravity feed') is more than sufficient to supply the engine driven fuel pumps. It's only when you get up to ~20k ft. that suction feed can become an issue - and this event happened near sea level.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Not matter what's happening on the aircraft side - pushing the thrust levers to the forward stop will give you (at least) rated takeoff power since the only thing required from the aircraft is fuel and thrust lever position (and the thrust lever position resolver is powered by the FADEC).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The TCMA logic is designed and scrubbed so as to be quite robust - flight test data of the engine response to throttle slams is reviewed to insure there is adequate margin between the TCMA limits and the actual engine responses to prevent improper TCMA activation. Again, never say never, but a whole lot would have had to go wrong in the TCMA logic for it to have activated on this flight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Now, if I assume the speculation that the RAT deployed is correct, I keep coming up with two potential scenarios that could explain what's known regarding this accident:
  <br/>
  1) TCMA activation shutdown the engines
  <br/>
  or
  <br/>
  2) The fuel cutoff switches were activated.
  <br/>
  I literally can come up with no other plausible scenarios.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In all due respect to all the pilots on this forum, I really hope it wasn't TCMA. It wouldn't be the first time a mandated 'safety system' has caused an accident (it wouldn't just be Boeing and GE - TCMA was forced by the FAA and EASA to prevent a scenario that had never caused a fatal accident) - and there would be a lot embarrassing questions for all involved. But I personally know many of the people who created, validated, and certified the GEnx-1B TCMA logic - and can't imagine what they would be going through if they missed something (coincidentally, one of them was at my birthday party last weekend and inevitably we ended up talking about what we used to do at Boeing (he's also retired)). Worse, similar TCMA logic is on the GEnx-2B (747-8) - which I was personally responsible for certifying - as well as the GE90-115B and the 737 MAX Leap engine - the consequences of that logic causing this accident would be massive.

     I am curious to learn what power source drives the high-pressure fuel pumps in the engine. If there is such a thing, I suppose there would.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Gearbox? This is at odds with a possible cascading electric failure that (might have) caused a loss of engine fuel feed.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     To my understanding on my ancient plane and engine design, the HP pumps that feed the nozzles are driven mechanically, which enables gravity feeding among other scenarios, but also assures the fuel supply is independent of whatever happens upstream of the nacelle. Except for LP/fire shut-off cocks.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  The engine driven fuel pump is literally driven off the engine gearbox (driven by a mechanical connection to the N2 shaft) - if the engine's running, the gearbox is turning (baring a major mechanical fault).  The engine driven fuel pump is a two-stage pump - a centrifugal pump that draws the fuel into the pump (i.e. 'suction feed'), and a gear pump which provides the high-pressure fuel to the engine and as muscle pressure to drive things like the Stator Vane and Bleed Valve actuators.  It takes a minimum of ~300 PSI to run the engine - the HPSOV is spring loaded closed and it takes approximately 300 psi to overcome that spring.
  <br/>
  Engine driven fuel pump failures are very rare, but have happened (usually with some 'precursor' symptoms that were ignored or mis-diagnosed by maintenance).  It would be unheard of for engine driven fuel pumps to fail on both engines on the same flight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As I've repeatedly posted, even a 100% aircraft power failure would not explain both engines quitting, at least without several other existing faults.  Again, never say never, but you can only combine so many 10-9 events before it becomes ridiculous...
  <br/>
  <br/>
  TCMA doesn't know what V1 is - it's active whenever the air/ground logic says the aircraft is on-ground.

     Is the ability of an engine to run using only suction feed ever actually checked or tested during operations or maintenance procedures?
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  A flight test (at least one - it's often duplicated) is performed as a basic part of aircraft/engine certification. One engine with all boost pumps off and on 'suction' feed - the other engine with normal aircraft boost pump operation (for what should be obvious reasons). Start, taxi, takeoff, and climb in that configuration until the test engine quits due to fuel starvation as a result of the engine fuel pump cavitation (done using "unweathered" fuel - once fuel has been at altitude for a period of time (hours or more - i.e. 'weathered'), most of the dissolved gases in the fuel have vented off, and suction feed works far better - often up to cruise altitudes).
  <br/>
  I don't think this test is ever done during normal operations or maintenance (at least not on purpose) as it is
  <i>
   very
  </i>
  abusive to the engine driven fuel pump - the sort of cavitation that this causes rapidly erodes the pumping surfaces (it's SOP to replace the engine driven fuel pump after such a test).

     In that case, I would think that it is not beyond the realm of remote possibility that for whatever reason there might be at least some of these in the field that will not actually function in the suction mode. And if we are talking about simultaneous dual-flameouts then we're already in the "realm of remote possibility", so they should be looking at these unlikely causes. If they're never tested, it's simply an unknown. Discussions so far just assume that this feature works. From what you say it would not be simple to test all of the in-service engines since the test itself is destructive. Perhaps there is some way to test without grinding up the pumps.
    </div>
   </div>

  The engine driven fuel pumps are regularly removed and overhauled - usually when the engines go through overhaul (somewhere in the 10-20,000 hour range).  The results of these overhauls are monitored, and if there is evidence of unusual deterioration, etc., that will be reflected in the recommended maintenance/overhaul intervals (BTW, this is SOP for virtually every system on the aircraft, regardless of Boeing, Airbus, etc.).
  <br/>
  The portion of the engine driven fuel pump that is subject to wear is the high-pressure gear pump - and excessive deterioration will become apparent in the inability to reach max TO thrust.  The centrifugal pump (that part responsible for the suction feed) is relatively lightly loaded and seldom experiences excessive wear or deterioration - even when exposed to severe suction feed events.
  <br/>
  As I've posted several times, in this business you 'never say never' - but the chances that
  <i>
   both
  </i>
  engines fuel pumps were deteriorated to the point where they could not adequately provide suction feed fuel to keep the engines running is very, very remote.
