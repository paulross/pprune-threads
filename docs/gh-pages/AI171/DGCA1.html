     An interesting statement.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Does the statement imply that something noted on the crashed aircraft was not present on the remaining aircraft.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     If the investigative team are aware of what happened, are they also aware of why it happened. As noted elsewhere - surely far too soon to be certain. If they are not aware of the why or how, how can they be certain there are no safety deficiencies.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Similarily, aircraft and maintainence comply with existing standards. It may well have been the case that existing standards were applied to the crashed aircraft. Does the statement imply that there was nothing wrong with either the Boeing aircraft or the Air India standards. What about the GE engines, are they considered part of the description of both aircraft and standards.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Or was the entire exercise merely a
     <acronym title="Google Page Ranking">
      PR
     </acronym>
     wash which achieved nothing other than optics that 787s and Air India are safe because standards are being maintained and aeroplanes have no issues.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I'm tempted to read nothing into the statement because it came from the DGCA rather than the AAIB of India.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  <br/>
  It was surely a worthwhile exercise, whatever the outcome. It hasn\x92t come up trumps but it was at least possible that inspecting the other aircraft might have thrown up a clue to the crash.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It would be interesting to know whether the crashed aircraft was used for parts around the Covid slowdown and whether this was exceptional or whether other inspected aircraft were similarly treated.

    As 5G telecommunications technology rapidly expands, India's Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has issued a directive requiring airlines to upgrade their aircraft's radio altimeters (RAs). This directive avoids potential interference between the new 5G telecommunications technology and the existing aviation equipment.

    For example, Air India, a fleet comprising 39 %

  I am not sure that is the case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under ICAO rules the AAIB has lead on this. It was an Indian registered aircraft that crashed in India, how could they not be?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The aviation minister ordered a &ldquo;high level&rdquo; investigation in to the accident. This is politics only.

     NEW DELHI, June 15 (Xinhua) -- India's federal civil aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu Kinjarapu Saturday said keeping in view the utmost seriousness of the incident, another high-level committee has been formed to probe the deadly plane crash in the western state of Gujarat.
    </span>
    <br/>
    <br/>

     The committee, according to Kinjarapu, will be headed by the home secretary and will submit its report in three months.

  This will make the minister feel he has control of the investigation and the narrative, in reality the EAFR data will be leaked by whichever party is in the clear.
  <br/>
  If the aviation minister understood his portfolio he would know that the AAIB and DGCA are the accountable and responsible agencies here.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Watch carefully.

  Please delete if already posted. This is from Reuters.

  "India's aviation watchdog has issued a warning to Air India for "repeated and serious violations" related to pilot duty scheduling and oversight, according to government directives reviewed by Reuters on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) directed Air India to remove three company executives from crew scheduling roles - a divisional vice president, a chief manager of crew scheduling and one planning executive - for lapses linked to flights from Bengaluru to London on May 16 and May 17 that exceeded the stipulated pilot flight time limit of 10 hours."

  3. The AAIB looked into crew rostering; this is a routine part of air accident investigations (maybe not in India? but they have NTSB and UK AAIB sitting in this time). The AAIB found irregularities; this is a safety issue, so they notified the DGCA. The DGCA would've told Air India, "we can pull your operator license over this, but we won't if you fire those responsible".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's a speculation, but I'd be surprised if it didn't fit the facts.
  <br/>
  Also, we can't draw any conclusions about the accident crew; the discovery could've been incidental, or the accident crew might be affected, but the investigation is ongoing, so that's not public yet. It will be in the report, perhaps in the preliminary report even. (I expect NTSB and UK AAIB insist on a preliminary report, but who knows.)

    Two teams from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) carried out surveillance during night and early morning hours at major airports, including those in Delhi and Mumbai. The surveillance order was issued on June 19, and the DGCA summarized its findings in a June 24 statement.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The assessment covered a wide range of areas such as flight operations, airworthiness, ramp safety, air traffic control, pre-flight medical evaluations and communication, navigation and surveillance systems. As part of this process, &ldquo;ground activities and aircraft movements were closely monitored to check the compliance [with] regulatory requirements and to identify weak areas for improvement,&rdquo; the DGCA said.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In one of the more notable findings, the DGCA observed multiple cases where &ldquo;reported defects reappeared many times on the aircraft indicating the ineffective monitoring and inadequate rectification action.&rdquo; However, the DGCA did not reveal details of the incidents, or the airline or aircraft involved.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Maintenance regulations or procedures were not followed correctly in some instances. Airport issues involved runway markings and lighting, ground vehicles and obstruction data.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    All of the findings have been communicated to the operators concerned, and they must take corrective actions within seven days, the DGCA said. &ldquo;This process of comprehensive surveillance will continue in the future to detect hazards in the system,&rdquo; the agency said.
