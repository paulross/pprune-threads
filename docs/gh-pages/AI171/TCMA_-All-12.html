     I\x92d like to add a complimentary test to user989\x92s logic on TCMA faults.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Regardless of whether the \x91aircraft on ground\x92 signal was incorrect after rotation it would have been correct during the takeoff roll. IF there was an unrevealed fault in a thrust lever position signal THEN why didn\x92t TCMA activate during taxiing or the takeoff roll?

     <br/>
     Such a fault occurring spontaneously in just the few seconds after rotation is way way down the probability table. Such a fault occurring spontaneously on both separate (think ETOPS) engine control systems is surely vanishingly unlikely.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     They may be out there but you\x92d have to ask if TCMA is implicated where are the lower consequence precursor events in the 787 fleet? These might be spurious TCMA action on one engine or faults with \x91aircraft on ground\x92 found during maintenance or engines not responding to thrust lever position and so on.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Change Analysis would ask what happened differently in the few seconds after rotation on this flight that separates it from all other 787 takeoffs and why at that particular time ?The interim report will provide some answers until then please let\x92s confine this thread to fact based technical discussion and debate.
     <br/>

  You mention here the a/c roll and after rotation but there is also a short period during take-off where the wheels are in the process of leaving the runway. There is also the situation where the MLG was suspended at an angle. What was the WoW value at this stage?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also during this period, the Rad Alt may not have been giving useful values given its proximity to the ground
  <br/>
  <br/>
  These two factors alone could increase the possibility of an error quite considerably.....

  Yours is very good logic, as far as it goes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But I'd posit these points (without making any assertions about the probabilities of the scenarios).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There is a flaw in the logic arising from the categorical assertion that the 'aircraft on ground' signal 'would have been correct' during the take off roll: "Regardless of whether the &lsquo;aircraft on ground&rsquo; signal was incorrect after rotation it would have been correct during the takeoff roll. IF there was an unrevealed fault in a thrust lever position signal THEN why didn&rsquo;t TCMA activate during taxiing or the takeoff roll?"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  What IF the 'aircraft on ground' signal into the TCMA systems was INcorrect during taxi and the take off roll, thus disabling the TCMA functionality during that phase of the flight, making no difference in any event because the engines were operating normally in accordance with the thrust lever settings? In that case, any error in, for example, the thrust lever signals and engine signals to the TCMAs would not have had any consequence. Maybe the signal reversed and stayed INcorrect after take-off. Of course, that's why we are all craving to find out from what source/s the TCMAs get the 'on ground/in air' input/s and what other systems use the same source/s.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And I reiterate the point that the TCMA is "just software". I haven't seen anyone dispute the suggestion that the thing 'common' to all 4 channels of the TCMA is 4 copies of software.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the earlier thread there was a statement about the 'obsession' of some with TCMA. I'm not 'obsessed' with it, but confess a prejudice towards trying to find a cause that is not a result of crew error. I therefore also have an attraction towards fuel contamination, but have difficulty in believing that fuel contamination would result in such a 'clean', immediate and simultaneous reduction in thrust from both engines after they'd operated normally during the take off roll.

     The 787-8 gear goes through the following movements on TO:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     3. When the pilot commands gear up, the gear retraction sequence begins, specific to the 787-8, the gear trucks tilt forwards first, instantly followed by the gear doors opening.

  I might have missed the thing, but as the gear up sequence did start we can be quite sure that the WoW logic had the aircraft \x94in air\x94 (not on ground).

  The gear tilt position is not definitive evidence crew had selected gear up. I've speculated another cause for this non-normal gear tilt is that C hydraulics failed around time of rotation. This would explain the gear remaining in the forward tilt position. There are reasons why the crew may have not selected gear up,

  There has been another incident of a TCMA equivalent function shutting down both engines. An airBaltic airbus a220 in July 2021 (YL- AAQ) had both PW1500 engines shut down by \x93TCM\x94 logic in the FADEC immediately upon landing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This seems to have been caused by a mismatch between actual and commanded thrust caused by rapid throttle movement that was \x93saved up\x94 until TCM was subsequently activated by its air/ground logic.

     There was no sign of asymmetric thrust failure, but rather, nearly total loss of thrust just after rotation. Something has caused a catastrophic electric failure that has impacted the air /ground logic functions. There are signs that this event is unique, although there have been cases in the past where the logic has failed and the aircraft no longer knows if it's airborne or not. The crew were probably faced with something they weren't trained for and overwhelmed them. There would have been not enough time to troubleshoot this.

  TCMA continues to be one of the few (very unlikely) causes of/contributors to simultaneous shutdown of both engines.  So far, though, I don't think we've seen a credible scenario explaining the possibility that TCMA was triggered in this accident.  I'm not sure I understand your speculation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the scenario you are considering, it's clear that the air/ground state would be wrongly "understood" by the TCMA function.  But we don't have,
  <acronym title="As far as I know">
   AFAIK
  </acronym>
  , a credible theory for how that might happen.  Surely it would have to result from either incorrect signals from the relevant sensors or a failure of the related logic in the FADEC TCMA function, or a combination of those.  Indeed, I don't think we yet know exactly which sensor readings that logic depends on or how those readings are fed to the FADEC.  Does your speculation include any thoughts about this?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also, the FADEC TCMA function has to "believe" that the engine is operating at high power and not responding to thrust lever operation.  In your proposed scenario, is this also a logic failure \x97 in both FADECs?  Or false inputs from both TLs?  Or are both engines actually operating at higher than commanded power levels?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Or do I misunderstand your post?

     Therefore we cannot determine wow or air/ground logic from an assumed gear retraction.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Further to the (logical in my view) points you make in response to AAKEE's ostensibly logical conclusion that the commencement of undercarriage retraction (if it did commence) is conclusive of the aircraft being 'in the air' for aircraft systems purposes, including TCMA purposes, I make the following points:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  First, whilst it may be that every system that monitors and makes decisions about whether the aircraft is 'in the air' does so on the basis of exactly the same sensor inputs, that may not be true and I'd appreciate someone with the expert knowledge on the 78 to confirm or refute the correctness of the assumption, particularly in relation to, for example, FADEC functions compared with undercarriage control functions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Secondly and probably more importantly, what happens if one of the sensors being used to determine 'in air' versus 'on ground' gives an erroneous 'on ground' signal
  <i>
   after
  </i>
  - maybe just seconds after - every one of those sensors has given the 'in air' signal?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Reference was made earlier in this thread to a 'latched' in air FADEC condition that resulted in engine shut downs after the aircraft involved landed and was therefore actually on the ground. But what if some sensor failure had resulted in the aircraft systems believing that the aircraft was now on the ground when it was not? I also note that after the 2009 B737-800 incident at Schiphol &ndash; actually 1.5 kms away, where the aircraft crashed in a field during approach - the investigation ascertained that a RADALT system suddenly sent an erroneous minus 8&rsquo; height reading to the automatic throttle control system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The conceptual description of the TCMA says that the channels monitor the &ldquo;position of thrust lever&rdquo; &ndash; no surprises there &ndash; &ldquo;engine power level&rdquo; &ndash; no surprises there &ndash; and &ldquo;several other digital inputs via digital ARINC data buses&rdquo;.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  WoW should of course be one of those "digital inputs" and be a 1 or 0. But I haven't seen any authoritative post about whether the change in state on the 78 requires only one sensor to signal WoW or if, as is more likely, there are (at least) two sensors &ndash; one on each MLG leg &ndash; both of which have to be &lsquo;weight off&rsquo; before a weight off wheels state signal is sent. Maybe a sensor on each leg sends inputs to the ARINC data and the systems reading the data decide what to do about the different WoW signals, as between 00, 01, 10 and 11.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There is authoritative information to the effect that RADALT is also one of the &ldquo;digital inputs&rdquo; to the TCMA. The RADALTs presumably output height data (that is of course variable with height) and I don&rsquo;t know whether the RADALT hardware involved has a separate 1 or 0 output that says that, so far as the RADALT is concerned, the aircraft to which it is strapped is, in fact, &lsquo;in the air&rsquo; at &lsquo;some&rsquo; height, with the actual height being so high as to be irrelevant to the systems using that input (if that input is in fact generated and there are, in fact, systems that use that 1 or 0).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If we now consider the &lsquo;worst case scenario will be preferred&rsquo; concept that apparently applies to the TCMA design so as to achieve redundancy, the number of sensor inputs it&rsquo;s monitoring to decide whether, and can change its decision whether, the aircraft is on the ground, becomes a very important matter. The TCMA is only supposed to save the day on the ground, if the pilots select idle thrust on a rejected take off but one or both of the engines fail to respond. In the &lsquo;worst case&rsquo; (in my view) scenario, both TCMA channels on both engines will be monitoring/affected by
  <i>
   every
  </i>
  WoW sensor output and
  <i>
   every
  </i>
  RADALT output data and, if
  <i>
   any one of them
  </i>
  says &lsquo;on ground&rsquo;, that will result in
  <i>
   both
  </i>
  engines&rsquo; TCMAs being enabled to command fuel shut off, even though the aircraft may, in fact, be in the air.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Of course it&rsquo;s true that the TCMA&rsquo;s being enabled is not, of itself, sufficient to cause fuel cut off to an engine. That depends on a further glitch or failure in the system or software monitoring engine power and thrust lever position, or an actual &lsquo;too much thrust compared to thrust lever position&rsquo; situation. But I can&rsquo;t see why, on balance, it&rsquo;s prudent to increase the albeit extraordinarily remote risk of an &lsquo;in air&rsquo; TCMA commanded engine or double engine shut down due to multiple sensor failure &ndash; just one in-air / on-ground sensor and one of either the thrust lever sensor/s or engine power sensor/s &ndash; or, in the case of an actual in air &lsquo;too much thrust compared to thrust lever position situation&rsquo;, why that &lsquo;problem&rsquo; could not be handled by the crew shutting down the engine when the crew decides it&rsquo;s necessary. Once in the air, too much thrust than desired is a much better problem to have than no thrust. The latter is precisely what would happen if all &lsquo;on ground / in air&rsquo; sensors were functioning properly and some &lsquo;too much thrust&rsquo; condition occurred.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hopefully the design processes, and particularly the DO-178B/C software design processes done by people with much bigger brains than mine, have built in enough sanity checking and error checking into the system, followed by exhaustive testing, so as to render my thoughts on the subject academic.

     TCMA continues to be one of the few (very unlikely) causes of/contributors to simultaneous shutdown of both engines. So far, though, I don't think we've seen a credible scenario explaining the possibility that TCMA was triggered in this accident. I'm not sure I understand your speculation.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     In the scenario you are considering, it's clear that the air/ground state would be wrongly "understood" by the TCMA function. But we don't have,
     <acronym title="As far as I know">
      AFAIK
     </acronym>
     , a credible theory for how that might happen. Surely it would have to result from either incorrect signals from the relevant sensors or a failure of the related logic in the FADEC TCMA function, or a combination of those. Indeed, I don't think we yet know exactly which sensor readings that logic depends on or how those readings are fed to the FADEC. Does your speculation include any thoughts about this?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Also, the FADEC TCMA function has to "believe" that the engine is operating at high power and not responding to thrust lever operation. In your proposed scenario, is this also a logic failure &mdash; in both FADECs? Or false inputs from both TLs? Or are both engines actually operating at higher than commanded power levels?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Or do I misunderstand your post?
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Let me try and summarise one possible scenario and then link in some of the better posts provide evidence relating to it:
  <ul>
   <li>
    In error, PF reduces power to idle and/or reverse at a speed after V1 (either deciding to reject, or for some unexplained reason e.g. the recent BA incident at LGW)
   </li>
   <li>
    Decision is changed to continue take-off, thrust levers moved to TOGA
   </li>
   <li>
    Let's say the thrust inputs are similar to NM985 and TCMA is triggered; and engines shut down around the time of rotation
   </li>
   <li>
    A/C rotates achieving a maximum speed in the region of 184kts
   </li>
  </ul>
  Relevant "ruling out" questions, with links to posts that add new information:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Q: Would the a/c have enough kinetic energy a 184kts to climb to 100-150ft agl and then reach its final position if the engines had failed at, or just, before rotation?
  <br/>
  A: Theoretically possible - see calculation
  <a href="https://www.pprune.org/accidents-close-calls/666581-air-india-ahmedabad-accident-12th-june-2025-part-2-a-43.html#post11907161" target="_blank">
   here
  </a>
  . NB, the a/c actually flew 1.5km from the end of the runway and 2.3km from the likely point of rotation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Q: Doesn't the forward position of the gear mean that power failed after the pilots had selected gear up?
  <br/>
  A: Inconclusive - had hydraulic power had been lost prior to rotation, the gear could also be in this position - explanation
  <a href="https://www.pprune.org/accidents-close-calls/666581-air-india-ahmedabad-accident-12th-june-2025-part-2-a-6.html?#post11903849" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">
   here
  </a>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Q: If the throttle levers were brought to idle during take-off, would the A/C have applied autobrake, reversers and speedbrake?
  <br/>
  A: Yes, although there is a built in delay before reverser and speedbrake actually deploy - see
  <a href="https://www.pprune.org/tech-log/633070-boeing-rto.html#post10804842" target="_blank">
   here
  </a>
  .
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Q: Is the ADS-B data consistent with this scenario?
  <br/>
  A: Yes, e.g. the Flightradar data shows the aircraft decelerating rapidly (12 knots in 4.2 seconds) from close to rotation. However, it's not clear how accurate this data is. For one, the altitude data is +/- 25 feet, second, while I was under the impression FR would have received airspeed data from the a/c sensors,
  <a href="https://www.pprune.org/accidents-close-calls/666581-air-india-ahmedabad-accident-12th-june-2025-part-2-a-47.html#post11907550" target="_blank">
   this post
  </a>
  suggests maybe not.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Q: Does TCMA activation require the thrust levers to be at idle or does it function when the thrust levels are above idle, but where the actual thrust is above that commanded?
  <br/>
  A: No, the latter is true (i.e. idle is not required) - confirmed
  <a href="https://www.pprune.org/accidents-close-calls/666581-air-india-ahmedabad-accident-12th-june-2025-part-2-a-17.html#post11904756" target="_blank">
   here
  </a>
  - there are of course many protections against false activation
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Q. Did AI171 have the same software version / logic paths as NH-985
  <br/>
  A. Unknown. That a/c had Trent 1000s so to some extent the software is different, but we understand the TCMA logic is broadly the same regardless of engine. I have not seen a post clarifying whether the TCMA software has been updated /changed via SB since 2019 to account for this incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Be grateful if posters could refrain from speculative responses "e.g. I think this is unlikely because I feel x". I am not opining on how likely this sequence of events is, simply trying to summarise whether or not this theory has been ruled in or out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I also recommend

     And I reiterate the point that the TCMA is "just software". I haven't seen anyone dispute the suggestion that the thing 'common' to all 4 channels of the TCMA is 4 copies of software.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  This has been setting a bit wrong with me for the entirety of the thread. When people say "software" they have an image in their head, and in this case the image is rather unhelpful if not outright wrong.
  <br/>
  When we say "Software" we mean things like this:
  <br/>

    <label>
     Quote:

    if ( happy == true ) {
    <br/>
    print("I'm happy!"
    <br/>
    }
   </div>
  </div>
  This is the type of software we are usually subject to in our everyday lives basically everywhere. Your phone, your fridge, your oven, your water heater, your car, etc. pp. ad nauseam.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In case of the Safran FADEC 3 this is not actually what we're dealing with. It uses something called an FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) which is a very different beast to what we are used to dealing with.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a normal computer we simply translate code like above into something less human readable but instead interpretable by a microchip or the like. This "machine code" is then run sequentially and does whatever it is meant to do (hopefully). If we were to expand our little happy check above with another condition then our computer would sequentially check these conditions. This opens up a lot of hoopla about timing, especially when interacting with the real world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Let's say you want to track N1 and N2 in an engine. You'd have to make a measurement, that value would have to go through an AD converter, which writes it to some (likely volatile) storage, where it is then accessed by some sort of (C)PU, transferred to yet another piece of volatile memory and then used in the computation. This takes time because you can't do those things within the same clock cycle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Unsurprisingly this is rather inconvenient when dealing with the real world and especially when dealing with volatile physical processes that need monitoring. Like a modern turbine engine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Enter the FPGA.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While it is programmable what that actually means is that (at a very high level) you can build a thing called a truth table, that means a definitive mathematical mapping of input states to output states. Unlike our sequential CPU driven system an FPGA will be able to perform its entire logic every time it is asked to do so. We don't have to wait for our happy check to perform any other check.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is very useful for our Turbine Engine, because now we can verify that N2 is smaller than X without delaying our check that the Throttle Control Lever setting is within acceptable distance to N1 and N2, while also creating the appropriate output for all the different bypasses and bleed valves in a modern engine, and so on. The Safran FADEC 3 does this "up to 70 times per second" as per the vendor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In order to be manageable the actual FADEC consists of multiple different pieces, many of which are FPGAs. At least two are used for so called "input conditioning". This is where we deal with converting messy real world values from sensors subject to real physics into nice and clean numbers. Here our values from the Throttle Control Levers come in, the signal from our N1 and N2 sensors, WOW signal, and on, and on, and on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is then changed into logic level signals provided to a different set of FPGAs. Lacking an actual schematic I suspect that this is what sometimes is referred to as "channels". The channel could consist of both a signal conditioning stage and then a logic stage or (more likely) redundant signal conditioning stages feed separately into separate FPGA "channels" are evaluated and then the end result is likely put into yet another FPGA for control output generation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <b>
   Why is this important?
  </b>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Because it is basically impossible for a "bug" to exist in this system. These systems are the epitome of a dumb computer. They do _precisely_ what they are meant to do. The TCMA is simply a set of conditions evaluated just like any other condition in those FPGAs. If there is an "error" then it is in the requirements that lead to the truth table used by these devices but never in the truth table itself.
  <u>
   In fact these types of computation device are used precisely because of that very property.
  </u>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  So when people say "the FADEC software" (ie TCMA) has "failed" or "has a bug" what they're really saying is:
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
   <i>
    The conditions that were experienced in the real world by the system were incorrectly assessed in the system requirements and lead to an undesired output state when taking into account the real world result we would have preferred.
   </i>
  </div>
  A bit of a mouth full, granted, but an important mouth full. This simply wouldn't be someone missing a semicolon somewhere in a thousand lines of code.

     I think tdracer said upthread, that there are two rad alt sensors, and one wow, giving three. Need to verify, `but if two out of three are in agreement, that might be enough redundancy.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  tdracer was detailing the inputs to TCMA on a 74 and has said repeatedly that he doesn't know the details of that function on 787s. I'm sure of that because I misread his original post and based a post of mine on the misreading. The inputs he described were multiple WoW switches and multiple RAs, with inputs from each group required to determine that the aircraft is on the ground to enable TCMA-initiated shutdown. It seems likely that the 787 is similar, but that hasn't been established here. I've been looking but haven't found the details yet.

  Whilst you\x92re right to highlight the type of software in a FADEC, it should also be recalled that after the dual uncommanded engine shutdown event on the Baltic CS300, the FAA mandated updated FADEC software for all of a family of P&amp;W engines. FADEC s/w can contain what we\x92d call bugs (whether they\x92re mistakes of coding or mistakes of logic in the design assumptions).

You'd have to make a measurement, that value would have to go through an AD converter, which writes it to some (likely volatile) storage, where it is then accessed by some sort of (C)PU, transferred to yet another piece of volatile memory and then used in the computation. This takes time because you can't do those things within the same clock cycle.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Unsurprisingly this is rather inconvenient when dealing with the real world and especially when dealing with volatile physical processes that need monitoring. Like a modern turbine engine.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Enter the FPGA.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     While it is programmable what that actually means is that (at a very high level) you can build a thing called a truth table, that means a definitive mathematical mapping of input states to output states. Unlike our sequential CPU driven system an FPGA will be able to perform its entire logic every time it is asked to do so. We don't have to wait for our happy check to perform any other check.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     This is very useful for our Turbine Engine, because now we can verify that N2 is smaller than X without delaying our check that the Throttle Control Lever setting is within acceptable distance to N1 and N2, while also creating the appropriate output for all the different bypasses and bleed valves in a modern engine, and so on. The Safran FADEC 3 does this "up to 70 times per second" as per the vendor.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     In order to be manageable the actual FADEC consists of multiple different pieces, many of which are FPGAs. At least two are used for so called "input conditioning". This is where we deal with converting messy real world values from sensors subject to real physics into nice and clean numbers. Here our values from the Throttle Control Levers come in, the signal from our N1 and N2 sensors, WOW signal, and on, and on, and on.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     This is then changed into logic level signals provided to a different set of FPGAs. Lacking an actual schematic I suspect that this is what sometimes is referred to as "channels". The channel could consist of both a signal conditioning stage and then a logic stage or (more likely) redundant signal conditioning stages feed separately into separate FPGA "channels" are evaluated and then the end result is likely put into yet another FPGA for control output generation.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <b>
      Why is this important?
     </b>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Because it is basically impossible for a "bug" to exist in this system. These systems are the epitome of a dumb computer. They do _precisely_ what they are meant to do. The TCMA is simply a set of conditions evaluated just like any other condition in those FPGAs.

  "it is basically impossible for a "bug" to exist in this system." This is not my experience.There are a lot of bugs in hardware and FPGAs. The guys doing this are real experts and bugs are less common than in software. But they do exist and they can be difficult to reproduce and subtle to diagnose. For someone new to FPGA it can be very intimidating because everything is parallel. It requires a different way of thinking. You can execute 1000 instructions simultaneously.Then various tricks to speed things up or reduce glitches add complexity. For example you may want to count in gray code or one hot instead of binary. Writing bug free FPGA code is very challenging. We cannot assume the FPGA code is free of bugs.

     This has been setting a bit wrong with me for the entirety of the thread. When people say "software" they have an image in their head, and in this case the image is rather unhelpful if not outright wrong.
     <br/>
     When we say "Software" we mean things like this:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     This is the type of software we are usually subject to in our everyday lives basically everywhere. Your phone, your fridge, your oven, your water heater, your car, etc. pp. ad nauseam.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     In case of the Safran FADEC 3 this is not actually what we're dealing with. It uses something called an FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) which is a very different beast to what we are used to dealing with.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     In a normal computer we simply translate code like above into something less human readable but instead interpretable by a microchip or the like. This "machine code" is then run sequentially and does whatever it is meant to do (hopefully). If we were to expand our little happy check above with another condition then our computer would sequentially check these conditions. This opens up a lot of hoopla about timing, especially when interacting with the real world.

  I will just comment here that FPGAs contain many logic blocks which have around them routing channels which allow these logic blocks to be connected up in various ways, some of the logic is asynchronous, some of it is synchronous and thus uses clock signals to advance the state of the logic according to a combination on input signals, asynchronous logic outputs and signals fed back from other logic blocks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All of this is created by writing software using something like VHDL (VHSIC Hardware Description Language where VHSIC stands for Very High Speed Integrated Circuit) with the output of the compiler for this software being an object file that contains the connection information for the on-FPGA routing. However, this process requires careful simulation, not just of the logical behaviour of the FPGA being designed but also of the ability of the programmable routing on the FPGA to get the required signals to where they are required with the necessary set-up delays so that the next clock edge does not allow a glitch where a signal changes state during the period when it must be static so that it propagates correctly through the logic blocks. With clock signals that form a clock tree across the device the skew on the clock signals must be carefully checked so that the lowest skew requirements are always met, there may be more margin for the less critical parts of the system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Now, I am sure that the state of the art has moved on a lot since I was heavily involved in this sort of engineering but I can say that when my colleagues were prototyping ASICs (which are application specific devices that are not programmable like an FPGA) using FPGAs because it can be reprogrammed to cure bugs found in the code that created it I am absolutely sure that it is possible for a latent bug to exist in what has been built despite extensive testing being carried out. I well remember sitting down with an FPGA designer and a software engineer and showing them a situation where one of my radio devices was not being commanded to transmit, they refused to believe me until we captured their output signals in the failed state and I was thus able to prove to them that it was their logic and code that was failing and that my radio system was fully working except it couldn't possibly transmit when its enable line was inactive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I would therefore never state that an FPGA-based FADEC is infallible. The devil will be in the detail of the functions contained within the devices and how they interact with each other and how the original logical functions are described and specified and then coded and checked for logical errors before getting on to the actual physical reality of the FPGA manufacturer's design and development system that bolts on to the back of the source code. If the FPGA devices are being pushed anywhere near the edge of their performance envelope, just like an aircraft things can go wrong. If a design begins with a device that is only just large enough in terms of how many logic blocks and routing channels are available for the logic required it's almost a certainty that development will take it to this area of its performance and a lot of tweaking may be needed which means that even more testing will be needed to be reasonable sure that it does what it is supposed to.

     If we now consider the &lsquo;worst case scenario will be preferred&rsquo; concept that apparently applies to the TCMA design so as to achieve redundancy, the number of sensor inputs it&rsquo;s monitoring to decide whether, and can change its decision whether, the aircraft is on the ground, becomes a very important matter. The TCMA is only supposed to save the day on the ground, if the pilots select idle thrust on a rejected take off but one or both of the engines fail to respond. In the &lsquo;worst case&rsquo; (in my view) scenario, both TCMA channels on both engines will be monitoring/affected by
     <i>
      every
     </i>
     WoW sensor output and
     <i>
      every
     </i>
     RADALT output data and, if
     <i>
      any one of them
     </i>
     says &lsquo;on ground&rsquo;, that will result in
     <i>
      both
     </i>
     engines&rsquo; TCMAs being enabled to command fuel shut off, even though the aircraft may, in fact, be in the air.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I don't think &lsquo;worst case scenario will be preferred&rsquo; is the philosophy they use. The way tdracer explained it, there can't be any single failure that leads to uncommanded high thrust on the ground. Presumably, each FADEC channel is treated as a single 'fault isolation area.' That's why the inactive channel has to be able to effect a shutdown in case the active channel causes a runaway.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the sake of argument, imagine if
  <i>
   every
  </i>
  air/ground sensor had to say 'ground' to enable TCMA. That should still meet the 'no single failure' requirement since you'd need at least 2 failures to get a runaway engine: the original thrust control problem, and a faulty air/ground sensor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  IIRC, he said that the 747-8 looks at weight on wheels, gear truck tilt, and radio altimeters. At least one of each has to say 'ground' for TCMA to be enabled.

  Could the testing of TCMA logic less robust for the portion that works only when is not armed (i.e. not on ground)? I am asking this because from previous posts the ground logic needs only one signal (WoW, radio altimeter) to be true, if so is correct a faulty sensor could have armed the TCMA? That would have removed a safety layer on the system.

  I read the whole threads, keeping my hands on the mousewheel so far since I'm not a pilot, just a EE / safety / systems engineer.
  <br/>
  The hamsterwheel ist spinning a lot here, and of course it could be anything including some VHDL FPGA code line or a broken RAM cell in a cheap memory bar within the computer it was compiled with. Anything is possible, but to be honest: development processes, if followed, are usually pushing the probability to a level where it becomes pure theory. BOSCH uses FPGA+\xb5C on the brake control box of cars. They sold 100 millions of those, used 4000h each (car lifetime) without error, with less strict development process. Most errors are made on requirement level, not code.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also, so far there is no evidence I've seen regarding the 'chicken-egg' problem, did the engines fall below idle (fuel, stall...) and this caused an electrical blackout (-&gt; battery, RAT...) or did an EE problem cause the engines to reduce thrust (FADEC, SW bug...). And where is the common cause in all this?
  <br/>
  There has to be a systematic error common to both engines, an external failure affecting both or a dependent fault with one affecting the other within seconds. This is the only thing I think everyone agrees here. And I refuse to beleave the external failure or dependent fault was sitting in the cockpit.
  <br/>
  I think it is something not common to every aircraft type for the last 50 years.
  <br/>
  So I started searching and found a candidate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I read myself into the EE architecture of this unique 'bleed-less' design and it's megawatt powergrid since this is the part where I may be able to contribute (and I'm most curious about). Generators on the 787 are &gt;250kW instead of &lt;100kW each and there are two per engine instead of just one. In fact, they can go up to 516 kW and shear off the gearbox at &gt;2200Nm (equal to &gt;2 MW, per generator).
  <br/>
  <a href="https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/downloads/7641/en" target="_blank">
   https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/downloads/7641/en
  </a>
  (page 11)
  <br/>
  So while on any other aircraft the generator is more like the dynamo on your bicycle, those generators are massive (x10).
  <br/>
  The gearbox is connected to the HP shaft (N2) on the GEnx. I learned from Wikipedia that RR moved this gearbox to the IP shaft on the Trend 1000. And RR is happy that the A330neo Trend 7000 uses bleed air and less load on the gearbox, since this maintains stability on the HP shaft at light load (also Wikipedia).
  <br/>
  Those generators are not in phase and frequency sync, or in other words: If you parallel them, they fight each other, it's like a short. They will almost block if this is not handled by the control box if possible (or some melting fuse blows at some point).
  <br/>

   787 electrical system - variable frequency generators?
  </a>
  <br/>
  Somehow I find it hard to believe that they are not able to disturb the engines despite that everyone here so far is claiming that there is no way an electrical problem could influence them because FADEC has it's own supply. I read that one is sufficent to start the engine, usually both are used.
  <br/>
  In my mind I find lot's of ways this could influence both engines simultanously. If just the BTBs on the 230V grid got some humidity (hot, no AC, water cooling...) and went up in one big arc (I think they made them semiconductor relays, too).
  <br/>
  Could those gearboxes and engines handle 4500Nm / almost 5 MW on each HP shaft, applied within a fraction of a second without any problem?
  <br/>
  Or if the engines were in a condition not far from compressor stall, one was stalling and 400kW load jumped from one engines generators to the other...
  <br/>
  I did some rough estimation and one of the generators could push N2 below idle in a second or less without fuel just with its normal 250kW load (just inertia).
  <br/>
  This is one point which is unique to this airplane model, so maybe worth a closer look.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I know that those engines are burning at &gt;100MW at full power, but how fragile in the balance between compressor load and this one turbine stage on the HP shaft / N2, without the inertia of a 2.8 meter fan? This is just out of my background, any thermodynamic expert here?
  <br/>
  Of course I also have no insight in SW and communication within the control boxes, how much they are talking to each other, delaying/ramping load redistribution etc. If FADEC recognizes a flameout, could it instantly command the generators to cut the load, even above idle rpm?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I would assume that some fuel contamination, valve blockade, even compressor stall would pop up slower. But such a generator could kick in within milliseconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As a safety guy I learned that one tends to look first at things one is familiar with (SW, HW, mechanics, pilot behaviour, maintainance, depending on one's profession) and in the end it's often the interface and dependent faults within which are not carefully considered (e.g. takeoff situation vs. thermodynamics vs. mechanics vs. power generation vs. humidity vs. generator control...) together with transient behaviour. It was the same with MCAS (safety culture vs. pilot training vs. SW design (repeated action) vs. single AOA input vs. bird strike probability close to ground vs. trim loading/blockade vs. stickshaker noise/distraction).
  <br/>
  In fact, I was trying to find information on all those systems and directly found slides on how the engines and generators could be simulated and the power grid tested in a HIL (hardware in the loop) environment. My experience from automotive is that such simulated environments are often far from reality and HIL environment programming finished after the product is already at the customer. But of course its far easier and cheaper to apply and test faults there. But then, some programmer programms what he thinks the reaction of the engine would be.
  <br/>
  This 'bleed-less' design was some massive change in airplane EE architecture with hugh consequences on the whole airplane design and extremely hard to fully analyze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I'm just asking questions and hope that we all learn a lot and this was fully considered or just not an issue. It's just an aspect I found worth mentioning and not only spinning the wheel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  PS: I doubt it was TCMA. The air/ground decision is done in a different box, evaluating 5 inputs in a 1/3 and 1/2 decision according to this discussion. This is then safely sent to the FADEC (as one input) and combined with the thrust lever position and N2. But if the thrust lever position is sensed (redundant and direct) close to idle, you do not need TCMA or ground mode to expect reduced thrust.

     I don't remember any credible posts suggesting that only one input to the air/ground decision logic is sufficient and I very much doubt that such is the case.

  Perhaps my earlier post was incredible and that's what prompted the SLF's question.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Let us assume a simple, hypothetical WoW sensor arrangement: One sensor per main landing gear.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of those sensors is indicating weight OFF wheels and the other is indicating weight ON wheels. What does the TCMA in each engine interpret that
  <i>
   ostensibly
  </i>
  contradictory sensor information to mean? (Note: For the time being, ignore the question whether the information is erroneous. It may be true.)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Are both engine TCMA's in the 'in the air' state, are both 'on the ground', or is one 'on the ground' and the other 'in the air'?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Given the purpose of the TCMA, I would have thought that any 'doubt' in this case would be resolved in favour of the 'on ground' state for both TCMAs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But maybe it's the other way around. Maybe any 'doubt' would be resolved in favour of both TCMA's being in the 'in the air' state.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I have difficulty in envisaging any advantage in the TCMA system being designed such that one engine's TCMA is in the 'in the air' state and the engine's 'on the ground'.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Whichever the design and outcome, there will be benefits and there will be risks.

  This was already addressed in one of tdracer's posts about the TCMA system: the air/ground decision is made by the aircraft itself (using multiple redundant inputs and voting logic), and only a single air/ground binary state is provided to the EEC(FADEC). Further, he also stated that the EEC assumes "air", as that is the safer state given the nature of its operations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Based on this, both engines will get the same air/ground indication from the aircraft and hence will always make the same TCMA decisions (subject to their individual throttle positions and thrust outputs).
