     The requirement for TCMA may have been specified by Boeing, but that doesn' t tell us who designed and built the solution in this case, though it must have been a collaborative effort between the two parties. Anyway, TCMA may be a red herring, since we still have not defined what, if any, other sources would have authority to issue an engine shutdown command
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  The "requirement" for TCMA was "specified" by the FAA. Manufacturers seeking certification of aeronautical products subject to the requirements then had no choice but to design and instal systems that met the FAA's certification requirements.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I'm pretty sure it's clear what "sources", other than TCMA systems if any, have "authority to issue an engine shutdown command", though it does depend on what you mean by "engine shutdown".

  I don&rsquo;t think that is clear at all. The shutdown hypothesis, if true, both engines, makes it likely that they were commanded to do so. While the discussion has centered around the TCMA subsystem, if other subsystems have the ability to do that, they need to be defined and looked at as well.

  Thanks for that. That begs the question, if there is overspead protection already, perhaps multiple channels and sensors, why is TCMA needed at all ?.  Blanket overspeed protection already covers the underlying requirement, ie: prevention of overspeed, all cases. Seems to be adding complexity for no reason.

  That is how it's done on the EC-135 helicopter (also FADEC controlled). One failed engine will disable the overspeed protection for the remaining engine. Of course a helicopter is a whole different story, though.

  TCMA is there to prevent higher than commanded thrust while on the ground in purpose to ascertain expected deceleration. N2 overspeed protection is a much older concept from the days before FADECs to prevent overspeeding engine disintegrsting and potentially causing lots of damage to the aircraft. In a GE engined 787 the N2 overpeed protection, while operating as designed, first try to lower the N2 and only if that fails it will shut down the engine.

     We have two donks individual fuel supply cut simultaneous in split seconds. There is no rudder activity visible for any thrust asymmetry during this timeframe. TCMA is implemented via the FADECs which are independent for each engine with their own power source from each engine. TCMA is designed to shut down its engine if its power lever is in retard position and the engine is still powering with too much thrust. In addition the airplanes ground sensors must indicate that it is on the ground. For each thrust leaver there are two independent position sensors. It is similar redundant designed as in modern car acceleration pedals. A dual redundancy in each thrust leaver. For TCMA to shut down two fuel supplies within split seconds we have to assume that 4 thrust leaver sensors malfunctioned and the ground sensing logic failed at the same time. The probability that this happens is nil (may be 1 in every 10exp15 hours) which would be about 10 times the age of our universe.
     <br/>
     Unless there is a software error in the FADEC TCMA system which only came to light on this flight. But there seem to be nothing special on this flight until rotation. If there is a software error I expect, that we get false single engine shut downs first. And that would already made the news if it happened during rotation.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Actually, according to
  <a href="https://www.pprune.org/members/414340-tdracer" rel="nofollow">
   tdracer
  </a>
  , each channel of the FADEC gets just one throttle resolver input, as the two resolvers are on separate wiring looms. So, the FADEC is using the dual channel feature to handle erroneous throttle position inputs. However, according to the patent at least, each channel can trigger TCMA and cut the fuel supply independently. So now we're down to only needing only one erroneous throttle signal per engine. Or one wrong interpretation of a signal, e.g. value clipping where you shouldn't (shortcircuit -&gt; idle), some integer overflow etc.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  So, from my understanding, if there is an issue with some of the throttle position sensors, the FADECs will detect a disagreement and keep the high thrust -&gt; assume safe is "fly", whereas one of the TCMA channels might read or misinterpret throttle position close to idle. As the thrust doesn't decrease, at some point the upper bound of the falling TCMA thrust contour will be breached and the engine will be shut down.

     Once again, a question for people who know: what happens if voltage is applied to CLOSED coil of HPSOV when OPEN coil was already energized (dual conflicting inputs)?
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I assume you're asking this because of the odd 'link', identified by an earlier poster, in the schematic in Boeing's TCMA patent application? If so, I wouldn't take that schematic as being accurate. There's at least one (other?) error in the schematic: The numbering of the diode in TCMA compared with the text explanation.

  A 'big hands / small maps' schematic in a patent application is not a version-controlled circuit diagram of the implemented system.

  The 787-8 landing gear retraction is primarily hydraulic, using the center hydraulic system for the main operation. However, the alternate gear
  <i>
   <u>
    extension
   </u>
  </i>
  system utilizes a dedicated electric pump to pressurize fluid from the center hydraulic system for gear extension. Obviously due its size and weight and staged retraction, the effort required to raise and stow the gear greatly exceeds that required for extension.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The main gear retraction/extension is controlled by the center hydraulic system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is apparent that the hydraulics failed when the engines shut down after breaking the down-locks and leaving the Main Landing gear bogeys in the tilt position, ready for a
  <b>
   <i>
    next step
   </i>
  </b>
  internal stowage and door closure (that was now never to happen). It is therefore apparent that the dual engine failure and consequent automated RAT extension was precipitated by this gear selection or retraction cycle and thus likely to be either WoW micro-switch or 5G Radar altimeter-effect associated. Due to accumulator depletion, the electric pump load would have spiked to replenish it. This may have precipitated the dual engine shutdown due to an unfiltered electrical surge affecting the Ground/Air microswitches (or a local 5G transmission affecting the RADALT) and resetting the TCMA.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The RADALT? Another plausibility? Because of the furore over a spasticated frequency allocation by the US FCC, the US FAA had finally &ldquo;bought in&rdquo; and declared that individual nations and their airline operators were responsible for their own 5G frequency spectrum allocations and for taking essential steps to ensure mitigation of the interference effects upon aircraft automated landings and other
  <i>
   critical systems
  </i>
  caused by their own national approved 5G spectrum decisions. It was admittedly a situation calling for extensive modifications to (and shielding for) the three radar altimeters fitted for redundancy considerations to all modern airliners... for Category 3 ILS approach and landing in zero/zero visibility conditions.  The RADALT also features in many air-ground sensing applications. (eg the 747-8).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This was an unusual FAA
  <i>
   &ldquo;passing of the buck&rdquo;
  </i>
  to manufacturers such as Honeywell etc. (to sort out with client operators). But then again, it was not the US FCC&rsquo;s right to dictate the specific 5G frequencies internationally. These spectrum allocations now vary over the wide selection of 5G phones available (and also nationally). 5G Radar Altimeters constitute a part of the ground/Air sensing that changes the TCMA from ground mode (able to fuel-chop engines) to the air mode (inhibited from doing so)... Ground activation is acceptable ...where fuel chopping of uncommanded thrust can prevent runway sideways excursions or runway length overruns. The question now becomes: &ldquo;Is it more (or less) safe having an automated fuel-chopping capability on BOTH your left and right, rather than leaving it to the pilot to react via his center console fuel cut-off switches... in the unlikely event of a runaway engine after landing (or during an abandoned take-off)?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <b>
   5G Frequency Variations
  </b>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The frequencies of 5G phones vary nationally based on the frequency bands allocated and used by different carriers in each country. In the United States, for example, carriers such as AT&amp;T, Verizon, T-Mobile, and others use a combination of low-band, mid-band, and high-band 5G frequencies.
  <b>
   Low-band 5G frequencies typically range from 600 MHz to 1 GHz, mid-band 5G frequencies range from 1.7 GHz to 2.5 GHz, and high-band 5G (mmWave) frequencies start at 24 GHz and go up to 40 GHz
  </b>
  . These frequencies are allocated by regulatory bodies such as the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and can vary between countries based on spectrum availability and regulatory decisions. In other countries, the specific frequency bands used for 5G may differ, leading to variations in the frequencies supported by 5G phones. Additionally, the deployment of 5G networks can also influence the frequencies used, with some countries focusing more on sub-6 GHz bands while others prioritize mmWave technology.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  5G interference? It may be an avenue worth exploring?

  The issue with 5G was the potential for interference with some models of radio altimeter. I think we have been told that RA is used in 787 air/ground logic.  We have also been told that air/ground state is used to enable TCMA.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I think it very unlikely that 5G interference was a contributing factor but I can see why someone would be interested in asking the question.

     The issue with 5G was the potential for interference with some models of radio altimeter. I think we have been told that RA is used in 787 air/ground logic. We have also been told that air/ground state is used to enable TCMA.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I think it very unlikely that 5G interference was a contributing factor but I can see why someone would be interested in asking the question.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I think the cellphone interference concern is indeed partly focused on radio altimeters, and also on some voice comms.  5G shouldn't be problematic for the altimeters though.  Modern ones operate at around 4.2-4.4 GHz, IIRC, and that's pretty far from any of the three bands 5G uses.  I seem to remember reading that EASA tested for 5G interference and that it permits 5G use in the cabin.  Whether that's true or not I don't know.  And it wouldn't be easy, or even realistic, to police it in an airliner cabin.

     Early during the 787 flight testing phase (9 Nov 2010) before the battery fire escapades, there was an electrical fire aboard aircraft ZA002 that had potential for serious consequences.
     <br/>
     From memory, the 787 electrical distribution does not involve electro-mechanical contactors but instead uses solid state devices that are controlled by software.
     <br/>
     The Air India accident aircraft was experiencing electrical problems in the cabin on the prior flight according to passenger reports.
     <br/>
     Were these problems addressed or where they non-MEL items?
     <br/>
     The accident aircraft seems to have experienced a significant electrical event coincident with transition from Ground to Air mode (which I would expect results in some software reconfiguration of the aircraft electrical system).
     <br/>
     If the ground to air transition momentarily activated a grounded electrical system, then there could be a rather large plasma cloud of vaporized metal surrounding adjacent wires which could send electrical power to places it would not normally go.
     <br/>
     Swiss Cheese model anyone?

  Very interesting. Pal of mine used to fly. Caught up with him last night over text. This is what he said:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  \x93An aircraft can be in service for many years before supposedly 'random' failures are discovered. We had a 747-400 departing JNB many years ago, and during the take off roll, the inboard leading edge flaps (flaps on the Jumbo, not slats) retracted. The only indication of this was the flaps secondary display popping up and crosses appearing over the inboard LE flaps. No Master Caution, no warnings of any kind. Apparently the system was working exactly as 'designed\x92!
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During the landing roll, when Reverse is selected, the inboard LE flaps automatically retract, to avoid damage from any debris blown up by the effect of the reverse thrust.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In this take off scenario, due to maintenance work being carried out earlier in the day, the aircraft thought the reversers had been selected, and 'correctly' retracted the flaps. At rotation, the stick shaker activated, and the aircraft struggled to get airborne. The passengers got lucky, as the First Officer, who was Pilot Handling, was an experienced aerobatic pilot, and was able to keep the aircraft airborne, flying in heavy buffet and with the stick shaker activated until the air-ground logic finally caught up after gear retraction, and the LE flaps deployed again.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Not something that most regular guys would cope with, particularly at night, with no outside horizon for reference. Pilots who\x92ve operated around Africa will know what I'm talking about.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They dumped fuel and returned to JNB.
  <br/>
  This happened on May 11th 2009 (Google it) - just how long had the Jumbo, of all variants, been in service before this 'glitch' was discovered?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The actual issue was that during the earlier maintenance, the engineers had cycled the thrust levers, with the engines off, all the way through the reverse gates, and back again (the aircraft had arrived earlier that day, and a reverser had failed to deploy). What no one knew, was that the action of moving the thrust levers through the reverse gate, would latch a bit of software logic in one of the computers on board, causing a near catastrophic sequence of events.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  We all know and love the Jim Reason Swiss cheese model - I suspect we're going to discover some previously unknown holes.\x94
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I find it rather a coincidence that this aircraft had so many electrical problems, had, not been retrofitted to solve one electrical issues like all 787s in the US had, and suffered what appears to be some kind of electrical failure.

  I have read that TCMA can not activate unless TL set to idle . How about this made up scenario . During takeoff run close to takeoff speed PF decides to reject for ANY reason and moves TL-s to idle . PM (captain ? ). Says my airplane we are continuing and move TL-s back to full trust . TCMA triggers and shuts off the fuel . I am not implying that crew did anything wrong .

  I'm pretty sure that's not true.  Everything I've found or read, and authoritative posts by tdracer, indicates that the required condition is thrust, as measured at N2 IIRC, higher than thrust lever position commands.  The lever(doesn't) hsve to be at idle.

     It does not follow that MCAS malfunction is a software malfunction.
     <br/>
     As far as I know, the software functioned exactly as it was specified/required to function. The problem did not lie in the quality of the software, as you suggest. It lay in the functional requirements for the function, and the hazard analysis of those requirements, and those are manufacturer tasks.

  I thought this was a very good point. There are some detailed posts discussing the TCMA patent
  <a href="https://www.pprune.org/accidents-close-calls/666581-air-india-ahmedabad-accident-12th-june-2025-part-2-a-6.html#post11903859" target="_blank">
   including this post
  </a>
  . Is it possible the TCMA software functioned exactly as specified, and the issue is input data into TCMA?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a total electrical failure, when the system switches to emergency battery power, how are input variables like rad alt and wow switches processed? (these were inputs someone mentioned on the 747-8, have the TCMA inputs been identified yet?)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I speculate the gear truck forward tilt is a symptom of a C hydraulic failure caused by a total electrical failure around the time of VR. Once they got 10 deg nose up on the rotation, with a total electrical failure, could the FADEC receive erroneous rad alt or wow inputs, and how would TCMA handle these inputs in the transition from ground to air logic?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  What is baffling is the simultaneous nature of the suspected dual engine shutdown. There is no obvious asymmetry, with the flight path or rudder movements. If the engine fuel control switches had been manually cut one at a time, there should have been some visible flightpath change or flight control response. Something happened to both engines at exactly the same time.

  SLF Engineer(electrical -not aerospace) so no specialised knowledge of any kind.
  <br/>
  The TCMA discussions on here seem clear that in normal operation the TCMA functions should not
  <br/>
  operate in air mode and the TCMA has multiple inputs from various sensors (Rad alts, WOW sensors).
  <br/>
  My query is to how these signals are routed to the engines, are they compared/aggregated in or routed through
  <br/>
  the EE bays. If they are present in the EE bays then fdr's idea of a water leak at rotate into the EE bays
  <br/>
  could generate shorts from the HV buses to the TCMA units.
  <br/>
  Are the TCMA units designed to cope with 400V AC inputs where a low voltage input is expected.
  <br/>
  I appreciate that the TCMA has to physically power a valve closed but applying high voltage to low voltage
  <br/>
  logic circuitry might have unexpected consequences.

     The only aircraft inputs to TCMA is air/ground and thrust lever positions - everything else is the FADEC and its sensors (primarily N1). Even if air/ground was compromised somehow, it would take other issues before TCMA could possibly be activated. Possible on one engine (although remote) - but two engines at the same time - almost literally imposssible (unless of course it's software error).
     <br/>
     The 'good' news is that even a cursory check of the FDR will indicate if TCMA activated, so we'll soon know.

  Software Engineer here. IMO software glitches are more likely than mechanical failures and pilot error, and I would say increasingly more so, particularly with Boeings. I have good reasons, experience and expertise for saying this that I\x92m not going to get into here because it\x92s too long winded and will no doubt upset some people who will mistake facts for rule and let it hurt their feelings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 2019 I think it was, an ANA 787 had a TMCA dual engine shutdown just after landing. There was also a bug that shut down all AC power on 787s powered on for 248+ days (integer overflow causing GCU failsafe) that was supposed to be remedied on 2019. Can\x92t find any information confirming that it was implemented on all 787s. These are just two examples of software bugs. There are placed of others, and it\x92s highly likely there are ones we don\x92t know about, either in the original software or in the updates.

     TCMA - first off, I have to admit that this does look rather like an improper TCMA activation, but that is very, very unlikely. For those who don't know, TCMA is a system to shutdown a runaway engine that's not responding to the thrust lever - basic logic is an engine at high power with the thrust lever at/near idle, and the engine not decelerating. However, TCMA is
     <i>
      only
     </i>
     active on the ground (unfamiliar with the 787/GEnx TCMA air/ground logic - on the 747-8 we used 5 sources of air/ground - three Radio Altimeters and two Weight on Wheels - at least
     <i>
      one of each
     </i>
     had to indicate ground to enable TCMA). TCMA will shutdown the engine via the N2 overspeed protection - nearly instantaneous. For this to be TCMA, it would require at least two major failures - improper air ground indication or logic, and improper TCMA activation logic (completely separate software paths in the FADEC). Like I said, very, very unlikely.

  You sound like you know what you&rsquo;re talking about. I&rsquo;m a software engineer. I think software glitches are more common for this type of event than mechanical failures or pilot errors. It can take years before software errors are discovered.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I read one post in here of a 747 flaps retracting on takeoff. No Master Caution, no warnings. Apparently, due to some maintenance triggering a software glitch, the computer thought reverse thrust had been activated during a take off. Whether it was still in ground mode I don&rsquo;t know.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Point is, being a software glitch in TMCA has already shut down two engines on a 787, I don&rsquo;t see why the same or another software glitch in TMCA or somewhere else couldn&rsquo;t do the same. Hadn&rsquo;t this plane just been in for maintenance?
