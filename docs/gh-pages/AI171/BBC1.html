     This is a screen shot taken from the Video thats posted on the BBC Verify website, that they have verified as authentic.

     I still can't see a RAT deployed.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I have seen your previous posts about this, and I happen to agree. Visually, as a lay man non visuals expert, I am in your \xabcamp.\xbb
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the rat is small, and the artifacts are plentiful. Small sensor, compressed video, compressed upload, zoom, it is in short an awful source.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the RAT is a much better noisemaker, and the audio signature is much more obvious than it&rsquo;s visual appearance in this case, and though the recording isn&rsquo;t fantastic quality, there was more than enough information there to objectively conclude the RAT is out. And that is my professional, on the weekend, opinion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I want to ask a pretty frank question for all of you, and I hope it is ok, from an audio specialist non-pilot:
  <br/>
  Provided the engines spooled down. Provided the RAT is out. (There are no explosions, no bird strikes.)
  <br/>
  Isn&rsquo;t software and previous electrical failures a red herring too?Would anything but a complete fuel shut off lead to this result? That still leaves everything from the Fate is the Hunter plot, to Airbus A350 center consoles and Alaska 2059 open as root causes.

  Aryan Asari, the 17-year-old who filmed the crash from his father's rooftop, gave his original interview earlier in the week to BBC Gujarati, i.e in Gujarati language.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I believe there are native speakers professional pilots on Pprune who might have read or could find the original piece. Could they help to clarify Aryan's statements in English?

  The BBC report in English also says that according to this witness account "the plane went on a downward spiral" which doesn't make sense given how low it was.

  More of this eyewitness' statements in Gujarati also might NOT have been translated into English. Maybe worth checking for more detailed information. Thanks.

  BBC's article quotes him as saying the shaking or moving left and right . But on more fresh interviews he didn't say that . He was assuming the plane was landing since it was his first time there . He came an hour before . He wanted to take video for his friends back at the village .  Apparently this is a phenomenon called Misinformation Effect "where well-documented phenomenon in psychology that describes the tendency for post-event information to interfere with and alter a person's memory of an original event."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Grand mother was the one saying it was shaking . She said her location was even closer to the airport  . She also said the plane was silent compared to how others make the sound

  Maybe he started incorporating extra information from her and in turn  Who know What Information she is getting Misattributed , Overwritten etc herself but her take is also possible take on engine failure.

  The Ministry of Civil Aviation has denied reports that the black boxes from the Air India plane crash are being sent overseas. The \x93Black Box Lab\x94 under India\x92s Civil Aviation Ministry is currently analysing the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder retrieved from the wreckage of the ill-fated Air India AI-171 flight. ( This must be the Rs 90 million allegedly state-of-the-art facility at Udaan Bhawan [ with the assistance of Hindustan Aeronautics Limited ], New Delhi which was ready on 9th April 2025 - shouldn't it be more appropriate for DGCA / MoCA to get needed expertise, if at all, to their Delhi facility ASAP ? ).

     That doesn\x92t make sense at all. 53% would be around 53t which is reasonable for that flight.
     <br/>
     A full fuel load of 100t would have brought them by far over the MTOM as there is only around 8t of load left with full fuel of 100t. My guess with 242 POB and some baggage would be at least around 24t of load. Furthermore the fuel burn for tankering almost 50t for 9h would be enormous.

  Multiple sources, including BBC, have quoted Amit Shah, Home Affairs Minister, as saying the plane had 100 tonnes of fuel on board. This seems to stem from a direct quote from Shah, in which it is reported he said:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <div style="margin:1rem; margin-top:0.3rem;">
   <div>
    <label>
     Quote:
    </label>
   </div>
   <div class="panel alt2" style="border:1px inset">
    <span style="color:#000000">
     The plane carried almost 1,25,000 litres of fuel, and due to the high temperature, there was no chance of saving anyone.
    </span>
   </div>
  </div>
  Using a rough approximation of 0.8kg = 1l leads to the 100t figure. Plenty of other sources for that 1.25 lakh litres fuel quote, including Times of India:
  <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/air-india-plane-crash-blaze-left-no-chance-of-rescue-says-amit-shah/articleshow/121815339.cms" target="_blank">
   https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/.../121815339.cms
  </a>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I have no idea if he actually knew how much fuel was on board, or whether he'd simply been told it was "full" and somebody had looked up the capacity (126k litres) and he then quoted that "full" number. Or whether, in fact, there was an excess of fuel. But since that seems so far the only public statement on fuel load, it shouldn't just be dismissed out of hand.
