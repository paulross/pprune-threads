     World wide grounding of the DC10 fleet after Chicago where maintenance had modified engine removal procedures which led to a wing engine loss taking out hydraulic systems that allowed the slats to retract ..aircraft stalled asymetrically and rolled inverted. Many other aircraft had damaged mounts/bolts not all were reported.

  AA191. The NTSB report with probable cause was published within less than a year, IIRC. But it wasn't all that difficult to determine once they knew that forklifts were being used to R&amp;R engines. In the 737 rudder hardovers, I think eight years passed between the first crash and a probable cause finding (in the second crash) that implicated the PCU servo. Of course, as someone has already posted, much more monitoring, data recording and transmission is available now in 21st century aircraft, although the accident aircraft in this case may not have transmitted much in the time available.

     Trying to keep an open mind, but\x85.
     <br/>

     Is no one surprised the lone survivor remembers a bang just before impact, and other things like apparently emergency lights, but has not mentioned the power going from takeoff power to nothing. Even the power change at thrust reduction altitude is often very noticeable in the cabin, so it surprises me nothing about the noise (and startle/panic) of full-power to no-power has been mentioned. I think we are getting into absurd scenarios trying to make the scenario of a simultaneous double engine failure just after liftoff fit, based on perhaps not the best evidence.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  As an expert on human memory and cognition has pointed out above (and we all more or less know), what that survivor remembers or he thinks he remembers \x97 and what we think or are told he doesn't remember \x97 cannot be considered accurate or reliable.  At all.

     I would guess that 787 pilot seats are electrically moved and use a worm gear drive.
     <br>
      <br>
       I'd be surprised if they are mechanically adjusted and held in place by a pin.

  They are electrically operated, and there have been known issues and incidents. See, e.g., LATAM 800.  Edit:  Just an old engineer, but the chances that uncommanded seat movement  was causative in the AI crash seem vanishingly small.

  Ah, yes.  Missed that.  Thanks.  But I have to assume (I know) that any responsible aviation engineers designing a system that can shut down both (all) engines simultaneously when the airplane is on the ground is going to want to make very sure that the airplane is on the ground.

  But I'll check.

     No, what I posted was the logic for the 747-8 - I simply don't know (or at least don't remember) what the TCMA air/ground logic looks like for the 787/GEnx-1B.

  I've been looking and haven't found the current TCMA configuration for that engine yet.  Perhaps of interest, I did find that Boeing petitioned for and received an exemption from \xa7\xa7 25.901(c) and 25.1309(b) in 2016.

     The TCMA patent application is at:

     Quite a simple system (not)
     <br/>
     What gets your attention is the fact that you can continue to operate the aircraft without an MMEL entry when one of the two systems (per EEC) that shadow each other... is unserviceable.
     <br/>
     As it says: "Typically the aircraft is allowed to operate for a limited period of time with just a single operative processing subsystem."
     <br/>
     That 787 was not long out of maintenance.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Thanks for posting this.  I read it quickly and glanced at the drawings, which are adequate for the patent application but not nearly adequate to understand the system in any depth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I note that, unless I missed it, the patent application doesn't address a mechanism for determining whether an aircraft is actually on the ground.  I suppose that will depend on some of those "several other digital inputs."

  Right.  When the aircraft is on the ground.  What inputs are used to determine whether the aircraft is on the ground?

     This has just appeared in the Times (of London) which is usually one of the most reliable sources of information in the UK.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     "A loss of engine power is emerging as the most likely cause of the crash of the Air India Boeing that killed at least 279 people at Ahmedabad on Thursday. The Boeing 787-8 series appeared to have suffered from lower than normal thrust from its General Electric GEnx engines as it took off and failed to climb more than 450ft before crashing, video and reports from the Indian authorities have indicated.The new information has eclipsed an early focus on the unusual configuration of the aircraft\x92s wing flaps and landing gear."

  Thanks for the heads up.  The story also says, "No cause has yet been identified for what would be an extremely rare power loss from both engines, but on Sunday the Indian civil air authority (DGCA) began urgent pre-flight inspections of fuel systems, electronic engine controls and other systems on Indian Boeing 787s."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And it quotes Juan Browne (Blancolirio): \x93There was something terribly wrong with this 787 jet and we need to find out really quickly what went wrong because we\x92ve got a thousand of these operating today and operators need to find out what happened.\x94

  Please, we really don't need any more snark in this thread.  And your snark suggests that you may not understand the implications of the story cited in the posts you quoted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That the
  <i>
   Times
  </i>
  reports, clearly based on information from official Indian sources, that loss of thrust in both engines was a key factor in this crash, and that DGCA has ordered urgent inspections of 787s because of preliminary findings of the investigation, is important news from one of the most responsible newspapers anywhere.  And Juan Browne's urging quick action and citing the importance to the entire fleet and to aviation generally is also significant.  He's a respected aviator many here pay serious attention to.

  Yes, so do I.  But we live now in a world where information from officials who aren't quoted because they aren't authorized to speak, or are authorized but insist on anonymity, is very often the only information available, especially early in an investigation like this one.  The fact that this story is in the

     [. . .] In this regard we can recall several instances of double engine failure associated with bird strikes generally involving large birds or large flocks or both. But it seems we have discounted this theory very early in discussion. Why? Because we cant see any birds, or flocks of birds or engine flames/surges or puffs of smokes from the engines which would support this. Really?

  It seems pretty unlikely that a bird strike that took out both of those

  engines simultaneously would not have been fairly obvious in ways that nearby observers (e.g., the crew, ATC, airport personnel?) would have noticed.   Possible, of course, but I don't think we've seen any evidence that points in that direction.  Also, for what it's worth, the

     Back to the subject of the TCMA, in order for the four channels (A and B for engine 1 and A and B for engine 2) to be truly independent, there would have to be, for example, four, separate weight on wheels sensors and two, separate throttle position sensors per throttle. I would be extraordinarily surprised if that's what has been implemented, but will happily stand correct.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  And a sensor per channel per engine for actual thrust, and sensor inputs in addition to WoW switches to validate on-ground state (perhaps radio altimeters, as described by tdracer for some of the 74s, which I misread as 787s).  I, too would be surprised \x97 stunned \x97 if all of that had been implemented.  I really want to know what exactly was implemented, and when and in which specific airplanes/engines.  What I expect, though, is that when we learn all of that, we'll decide that it really is exceedingly unlikely that TCMA shut down those engines in Ahmedabad the other day.  But it sure looks like something did.

  Thanks.  Do we know that these are monitored by TCMA for air/ground state and if so, do we know the logic used to make a determination based on those inputs?  Alternatively, do you know where we should be looking for those answers?

     No idea. I only got that info from the Master MEL on the FAA website. According to the MMEL the aircraft can be dispatched as long as there is one of each type sensor working on each main gear. (AIs MEL could be more restrictive)

  Thanks again. Yes, I checked the MMEL too.
  <strike>
   It also says that the aircraft may be dispatched with one of two TCMA functions operational
  </strike>
  .  Edit:  dragon6172 has pointed out that the cited MMEL entry for TCMA applies to Rolls Royce engines, so not relevant here.

     Pretty sure that the (RR) after that TCMA entry means it is only applicable to Rolls Royce engines. I believe the accident aircraft had GE engines?

  Ah, you're right.  Didn't notice.  And the accident aircraft did have GE engines.  Thanks.
