     That picture of the mostly intact tail section should indicate that the FDR and CVR should be eminently recoverable, most likely not even damaged, right?

  The Dreamliner as two identical &ldquo;Enhanced Airborne Flight Recorders&rdquo;, one in the tail section and one beneath the flight deck. Each one contains the CVR + FDR in one module, both have 10 minutes of battery power backup. I see reports that the one in the tail section has been recovered. All to easy to surmise the contents will be tampered with at the request of politicians/investors

  Surely a Dreamliner pilot on Prune has a realistic Flight Sim where they can try taking off with each of the suggested faults/errors and see which one(s) result in the aircraft crashing in the way seen?

  <br/>
  <br/>
  Given the evidence now in the public domain of RAT auto-deployment and simultaneous roll back, with no bird strikes, the most plausible primary trigger is a simultaneous, fuel-related thrust failure on both GEnx-1B engines. Simultaneous FADEC failure seems less likely, at least without tampering.

  There's some possible fuel contamination mechanisms which would only affect one aircraft
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - The fuel truck&rsquo;s water-absorbing &ldquo;monitor&rdquo; element breaks up, the first aircraft after the break gets the bead slug; later uplifts may be clear once the hose is flushed. The beads jam metering valves almost immediately.
  <br/>
  - After pipe maintenance, the first few hundred litres can carry residual cleaning surfactant that strips protective films and causes filter-monitor &ldquo;soap lock&rdquo;.
  <br/>
  - Biofilm growth happens inside one aircraft&rsquo;s wing tanks when it sits in humid conditions or does short hops with warm fuel. On the next flight the biofilm shears off, blocks strainers,

  As more days pass without the FAA/EASA issuing an emergency Airworthiness Directive re. the 787 Dreamliner, it does appear more likely the cause of the crash was specific to the Air India aircraft (as per speculation on fuel contamination, bad maintenance, crew error etc. etc.)

     Without incurring the wrath of the moderators, can I add another improbable and maybe with current understanding impossible possibility.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Electro magnetic interference. Intended or accidential.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I apologise that it might be another rabbit hole, but at present, and to quote the esteemed tdracer, 'never say never' and 'this is perplexing'.

  I looked at the possibility of a Directed Energy Weapon (DEW) being used to disrupt the onboard systems; India's Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) has been developing several types of DEW to counter drones (
  <i>
   ADITYA
  </i>
  and
  <i>
   KALI
  </i>
  projects). However this seems to be a very, very unlikely cause due the extent of shielding on the 787 electronics.

     I wonder if the delay in announcing any preliminary findings is because of the enormity of the consequences.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Let us say the investigation team have discovered a unique technical fault that caused the accident, but don&rsquo;t yet know why it happened, how would the team proceed? On the one hand they&rsquo;ve uncovered a fault which could reoccur and cause another accident (but a fault that has only happened once in 14 years). On the other hand a grounding would have enormous commercial consequences worldwide, with the possibility that an inspection and/or rectification are not yet available.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     What would they do?
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  A case in point is the 2013 Boeing 787 battery fires. After two thermal runaways in 52 000 flight-hours, the root cause was still unknown; however, the FAA nevertheless issued Emergency AD 2013-02-51 grounding every 787 until a modification was available. IMHO a risk where the outcome is catastrophic, even very low probability, would trigger the FAA to issue an Emergency Airworthiness Directive as per their policy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As I said in a previous post, every day that passes without a EAD suggest the cause was was specific to that aircraft (fuel contamination, maintenance failure, crew error - pick you own theory)
