     That picture of the mostly intact tail section should indicate that the FDR and CVR should be eminently recoverable, most likely not even damaged, right?

  Given the evidence now in the public domain of RAT auto-deployment and simultaneous roll back, with no bird strikes, the most plausible primary trigger is a simultaneous, fuel-related thrust failure on both GEnx-1B engines. Simultaneous FADEC failure seems less likely, at least without tampering.

  There's some possible fuel contamination mechanisms which would only affect one aircraft

  <br/>
  - The fuel truck&rsquo;s water-absorbing &ldquo;monitor&rdquo; element breaks up, the first aircraft after the break gets the bead slug; later uplifts may be clear once the hose is flushed. The beads jam metering valves almost immediately.

  - After pipe maintenance, the first few hundred litres can carry residual cleaning surfactant that strips protective films and causes filter-monitor &ldquo;soap lock&rdquo;.

  As more days pass without the FAA/EASA issuing an emergency Airworthiness Directive re. the 787 Dreamliner, it does appear more likely the cause of the crash was specific to the Air India aircraft (as per speculation on fuel contamination, bad maintenance, crew error etc. etc.)

     Without incurring the wrath of the moderators, can I add another improbable and maybe with current understanding impossible possibility.

     Electro magnetic interference. Intended or accidential.

     I apologise that it might be another rabbit hole, but at present, and to quote the esteemed tdracer, 'never say never' and 'this is perplexing'.

  I looked at the possibility of a Directed Energy Weapon (DEW) being used to disrupt the onboard systems; India's Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) has been developing several types of DEW to counter drones (
  <i>
   ADITYA
  </i>
  and
  <i>
   KALI

  projects). However this seems to be a very, very unlikely cause due the extent of shielding on the 787 electronics.

     I wonder if the delay in announcing any preliminary findings is because of the enormity of the consequences.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Let us say the investigation team have discovered a unique technical fault that caused the accident, but don&rsquo;t yet know why it happened, how would the team proceed? On the one hand they&rsquo;ve uncovered a fault which could reoccur and cause another accident (but a fault that has only happened once in 14 years). On the other hand a grounding would have enormous commercial consequences worldwide, with the possibility that an inspection and/or rectification are not yet available.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     What would they do?
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  A case in point is the 2013 Boeing 787 battery fires. After two thermal runaways in 52 000 flight-hours, the root cause was still unknown; however, the FAA nevertheless issued Emergency AD 2013-02-51 grounding every 787 until a modification was available. IMHO a risk where the outcome is catastrophic, even very low probability, would trigger the FAA to issue an Emergency Airworthiness Directive as per their policy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As I said in a previous post, every day that passes without a EAD suggest the cause was was specific to that aircraft (fuel contamination, maintenance failure, crew error - pick you own theory)

  We know that the right-hand GEnx-1B was removed for overhaul and re-installed in March 2025 so it was at \x93zero time\x94 and zero cycles, meaning a performance asymmetry that the FADEC would have to manage every time maximum thrust is selected. If the old engine was still on the pre-2021 EEC build while the fresh engine carried the post-Service Bulletin software/hardware, a dual \x93commanded rollback\x94 is plausible. A latent fault on one channel with the mid-life core can prompt the other engine to match thrust to maintain symmetry, leading to dual rollback.

     You think the Thrust Asymmetry Protection could kick in and leave the aircraft with little to no thrust?
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  This could be several issues aligning to cause the loss of thrust. If the new engine was installed and the synchronisation step was omitted by maintenance staff and the engines had different CPU/software versions then there could be an emergent failure mode when maximum thrust is applied resulting in a FADEC rollback. Almost impossible to anticipate and create that in a test scenario. Don't overlook that the pilot moving thrust levers to override rollback will be ignored by the software, if the FADEC has flipped into protective mode.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That said, the continued absence of the FAA issuing an Emergency Airworthiness Directive for the Dreamliner suggests to me the fault was something like contaminated fuel which was specific to that flight.

  With the recent (albeit unofficial) indications that both engine fuel control switches were found in the CUTOFF position, I wonder if it's time to reassess the tone and meaning of Captain Sabharwal's final transmission (perhaps translated from Hindi) &ldquo;Thrust not achieved&hellip; falling&hellip; Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!&rdquo;
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Viewed in light of the reported switch positions, the phrasing feels increasingly ambiguous. As is often stated on PPRunE, communication comes after aviation so you wonder why in the crisis and at low altitude, this message was transmitted. Being so atypical, the message merits re-examination.

  That said, switches found in the RUN position don\x92t generate investigative focus, they're assumed to be where they should be. The mere fact that the fuel switches are attracting attention implies there's something abnormal.

  FAA issued an SAIB in 2018 about these fuel control switches being installed without the locking feature engaged\x97Air India didn\x92t act on it (not mandatory).
  <br/>
  No evidence of birdstrike, fire, or mechanical failure. Both engines had good health data. The only obvious explanation at this stage is an inadvertent dual shutdown by crew,

  That &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t&rdquo; on the CVR doesn&rsquo;t sit right. If the cutoff switch movement was accidental, one would expect shock, confusion, or immediate troubleshooting, not a flat denial.

  It seems to me that there must have been further dialogue after the bland "I didn't". To have nothing reported after that two-line exchange, until the MAYDAY at 08:09:05, is a highly suspect omission from the interim report. In a two-crew cockpit, facing a sudden dual engine rollback just after rotation, I find it very hard to believe that this two-line exchange was the only interaction captured.
