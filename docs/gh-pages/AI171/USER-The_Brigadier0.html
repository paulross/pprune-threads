     That picture of the mostly intact tail section should indicate that the FDR and CVR should be eminently recoverable, most likely not even damaged, right?

  Given the evidence now in the public domain of RAT auto-deployment and simultaneous roll back, with no bird strikes, the most plausible primary trigger is a simultaneous, fuel-related thrust failure on both GEnx-1B engines. Simultaneous FADEC failure seems less likely, at least without tampering.

  There's some possible fuel contamination mechanisms which would only affect one aircraft
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - The fuel truck&rsquo;s water-absorbing &ldquo;monitor&rdquo; element breaks up, the first aircraft after the break gets the bead slug; later uplifts may be clear once the hose is flushed. The beads jam metering valves almost immediately.
  <br/>
  - After pipe maintenance, the first few hundred litres can carry residual cleaning surfactant that strips protective films and causes filter-monitor &ldquo;soap lock&rdquo;.
  <br/>
  - Biofilm growth happens inside one aircraft&rsquo;s wing tanks when it sits in humid conditions or does short hops with warm fuel. On the next flight the biofilm shears off, blocks strainers,

  As more days pass without the FAA/EASA issuing an emergency Airworthiness Directive re. the 787 Dreamliner, it does appear more likely the cause of the crash was specific to the Air India aircraft (as per speculation on fuel contamination, bad maintenance, crew error etc. etc.)

     Without incurring the wrath of the moderators, can I add another improbable and maybe with current understanding impossible possibility.

     Electro magnetic interference. Intended or accidential.

  I looked at the possibility of a Directed Energy Weapon (DEW) being used to disrupt the onboard systems; India's Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) has been developing several types of DEW to counter drones (

  and
  <i>

  projects). However this seems to be a very, very unlikely cause due the extent of shielding on the 787 electronics.

     I wonder if the delay in announcing any preliminary findings is because of the enormity of the consequences.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Let us say the investigation team have discovered a unique technical fault that caused the accident, but don&rsquo;t yet know why it happened, how would the team proceed? On the one hand they&rsquo;ve uncovered a fault which could reoccur and cause another accident (but a fault that has only happened once in 14 years). On the other hand a grounding would have enormous commercial consequences worldwide, with the possibility that an inspection and/or rectification are not yet available.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     What would they do?
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  A case in point is the 2013 Boeing 787 battery fires. After two thermal runaways in 52 000 flight-hours, the root cause was still unknown; however, the FAA nevertheless issued Emergency AD 2013-02-51 grounding every 787 until a modification was available. IMHO a risk where the outcome is catastrophic, even very low probability, would trigger the FAA to issue an Emergency Airworthiness Directive as per their policy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As I said in a previous post, every day that passes without a EAD suggest the cause was was specific to that aircraft (fuel contamination, maintenance failure, crew error - pick you own theory)

  We know that the right-hand GEnx-1B was removed for overhaul and re-installed in March 2025 so it was at \x93zero time\x94 and zero cycles, meaning a performance asymmetry that the FADEC would have to manage every time maximum thrust is selected. If the old engine was still on the pre-2021 EEC build while the fresh engine carried the post-Service Bulletin software/hardware, a dual \x93commanded rollback\x94 is plausible. A latent fault on one channel with the mid-life core can prompt the other engine to match thrust to maintain symmetry, leading to dual rollback.

     You think the Thrust Asymmetry Protection could kick in and leave the aircraft with little to no thrust?
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  This could be several issues aligning to cause the loss of thrust. If the new engine was installed and the synchronisation step was omitted by maintenance staff and the engines had different CPU/software versions then there could be an emergent failure mode when maximum thrust is applied resulting in a FADEC rollback. Almost impossible to anticipate and create that in a test scenario. Don't overlook that the pilot moving thrust levers to override rollback will be ignored by the software, if the FADEC has flipped into protective mode.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That said, the continued absence of the FAA issuing an Emergency Airworthiness Directive for the Dreamliner suggests to me the fault was something like contaminated fuel which was specific to that flight.
