  10 seconds to respond is a long long time if you&rsquo;ve just made a silly mistake, you&rsquo;d have those switches back on in a second. The startle factor isn&rsquo;t really a factor here, because you
  <b>
   know
  </b>
  what just happened.
  <br/>
  What is also unusual to me is the 4 second gap between moving Eng 1 fuel switch from cutoff to run, and moving Eng 2 fuel switch from cutoff to run.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One would imagine that in this situation, speed of response would have been critical. Why the slow, deliberate &lsquo;reaction&rsquo;?

  As Captains of Boeing twins, which fuel switch do you typically move first, Eng 1 or Eng 2?
  <br/>
  As First Officers, same question.

  Higher probability that the PM (Captain) manipulated the switches given the sequence of events.

     Regardless of what actually happened in that cockpit, reasoning like this seems completely backwards to me. Since when do humans reliably, instantly recognise that they've just made a mistake? If they were
     <i>
      that
     </i>
     attuned to their actions they're almost certainly attuned enough to
     <i>
      not
     </i>
     make the mistake in the first place, especially if we're talking about an action slip. I've e.g. absentmindedly added salt to my tea instead of sugar and I certainly didn't immediately realise that I'd done that - in fact it took a good few seconds even after sipping and spitting it out for my brain to catch up to what must have happened. Even if an observer had pointed out to me before drinking it that my tea had salt in it, I would just have been confused because
     <i>
      obviously
     </i>
     I wouldn't do something that silly (spoiler alert: I did)..

     On top of that I feel like people are overestimating how long ten seconds actually is, especially considering some of those seconds are reported to have been taken up by confused dialogue (that isn't even reported in its entirety). I thought it was common wisdom that accidents are never down to one thing; it would be light-years from being the first time that suboptimal crew response turned a maybe-recoverable error into a definite disaster without an ounce of malice in the mix.

  After making a mistake like accidentally turning off the engines, most pilot's brains would
  <b>
   immediately
  </b>
  realize what they&rsquo;d done, and their hand being right there, they&rsquo;d
  <b>
   immediately
  </b>
  reset both fuel switches to run. If you were slow, it would take 2 seconds, not 10.
  <br/>
  Again, the situation isn&rsquo;t a surprise to you, you
  <b>
   know
  </b>
  what just happened.

     If the thrust levers were found in idle but, according to the EAFR, were set to TO thrust until the end, doesn\x92t that also raise further questions?

  probably whatever bent the reverser levers also moved the thrust levers backwards, this is certainly no big mystery

     Deliberate pilot action should be ruled out until any evidence and motivation for why that's the case emerges.
     <br>
      <br>
       All we know is the fuel cut off switches were flipped to Cutoff for 10 seconds and then to run again. Not how or by what. The focus should be on how this could occur. Accidentally, technical malfunction, a foreign object somehow hitting and moving them or other reason?
       <br>
        <br>
         Theories needs to be tested in a cockpit with the exact configuration of this aircraft and with the angles and forces involved as much as we can. It should be possible to simulate it pretty closely and whatever happened should be repeatable. It's going to be something extremely unlikely, or we'd have seen it before in 10 years of 787 service.

   </div>
  </div>
  The one pilot asked the other one, \x93why did you cutoff?\x94
  <br>
   He didn\x92t say, \x93did you just see that pink elephant fall off the dashboard?\x94
   <br>
    <br>
     How are you going to \x93simulate something pretty closely\x94 when it\x92s also \x93extremely unlikely\x94?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The chance that it was a mechanical or electrical failure of
     <b>
      both
     </b>
     fuel switches ,
     <b>
      2 seconds apart
     </b>
     , is for all intents and purposes, zero.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Therefore they were moved by hand.
