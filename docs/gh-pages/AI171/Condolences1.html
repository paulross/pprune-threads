     It will come as no surprise to anyone that EE bays are well protected with the sort of things you have described.
     <br/>
     The 787 batteries are also in separate EE bays. Main one in the front and the dedicated APU battery in the power electrics bay aft of the landing gear.
     <br/>
     They are both contained in fireproof boxes that will vent to atmosphere in the event of a thermal runaway.
     <br/>
     I have been working on 787s for over a decade and leaks from gallies and lavs has not once been on my list of snags.

  The first B744 flood event in the E&amp;E was 25 years into the operation with one airline, and the other 2 occurred over 30 years into the operation of the type, one was uniquely a cargo loading event, and how the OEM would have guessed that some carrier would enter a wading pool worth of rain water into the E&amp;E, they had and have my sympathy. We took action after that to avoid a repetition, but it wasn't on the radar before it ended up with a bit of excitement for the crew. They happened to have a nice clear evening when the whole cockpit went darl. The B787 has a AD out since 2016 which was added to last year related to unwanted leaks. My own event with a B777 ended up with over 6 cubic meters of ice in the belly of the B773ER, and was only found doing a walk around where there was a number of the belly drains drooling onto the ramp, which happened to be dry. An event external to the system architecture remains a high probability, and as unusual as that may be it is not without precedent, with existing AD's related to such matters extant.

  When pax flush clothing and other rubbish down a vacuum toilet system, the potential for stuff to not work as advertised is not zero.
