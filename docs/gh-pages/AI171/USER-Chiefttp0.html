  767 pilot here, on the 767 it would capture the altitude, but more importantly, it would freeze the airspeed at whatever speed the alt capture occurred at. So the thrust levers would retard to maintain the much slower speed at the point of capture. This could be a possible scenario, especially if the crew was slow to realize what happened, AND the 787 has a similar low altitude capture issue.

     I agree with what you posted however the solution is so simple that I can&rsquo;t believe a professional flight crew would not handle it without much of a blip. Push the trust levers forward.

  Salvi, just spitballing here, a low alt capture is simple to rectify, but if you&rsquo;re not expecting it ( perhaps a wrong MCP alt setting) coupled with a HUD , which focuses your attention on it, not the thrust levers, and add to the mix an inexperienced F/O. I can

  also see in the final moments of desperation, reaching down and turning the Fuel Control Switches, OFF-THEN-ON, in the hope that an engine will come to life, if they believed that the engine was dead. This may be the reason the RAT extended? Just thinking out loud.

  Galaxy flyer,

  UPS had a triple engine shutdown on A RR Tay engined 727. The crew got one started in the nick of time and were able to land at KORD. I know the crewmemebers.

  I&rsquo;m a 767 Pilot, so I&rsquo;m not sure if this applies exactly to the 787. Referring to Loose Rivets post mentioning a longer than usual takeoff run, perhaps a scenario I&rsquo;ve seen in simulator sessions may have occurred. On the 767 we have a Thrust Mode Selection Panel (TMSP). To demonstrate a potential error that could occur, an Instructor would select &ldquo; Climb thrust&rdquo; on the TMSP instead of a takeoff thrust setting prior to takeoff. This can inadvertantly happen. In any event, if the crew mistakenly took off in a Climb thrust instead of a takeoff thrust, the takeoff roll will be much longer. With the high temperature conditions that day, the climb out would have been anemic, possibly prompting the crew to believe there was an engine thrust issue. In the simulators, when this issue was demonstrated, most crews didn&rsquo;t realize what was happening and continued the takeoff anyway resulting in tail strikes, and or very sluggish climb performance. There are protections to avoid this, but the insidious nature of this scenario has caught many a crew.

  My only question is, after close to 40 years flying, on takeoff, if I lost thrust/ Power, my immediate reaction would NOT BE TO CHECK THE FUEL CONTROL SWITCHES. Unless the Pilot flying saw the Pilot monitoring visually reach down and shut the fuel control switches off, which would be odd since as the PF, your attention is looking at the instruments and outside, not inside and downward in the direction of the FC switches. It seems odd how quickly they ascertained the fuel control switches were shut off. No startle factor, or confusion, just a very quick determination that the FC switches were cutoff. Very strange.
