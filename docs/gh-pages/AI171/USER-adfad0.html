  Can anyone help with my theory - I'm an electronics and software engineer, but not a pilot.
  <br/>
  My understanding of the infamous and previously fixed 787 issue was that the PCU software would trigger a shutdown of
  <b>
   all
  </b>
  AC generators (or rather their respective control units) after 248 days of continuous power due to an overflow of a software counter, and that this was fixed in software alone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <b>
   Hypothetically
  </b>
  , if the PCU software triggered this state during takeoff, what would happen? I know the engines may continue running with engine-driven fuel pumps, but I also understand this doesn't work in all situations and perhaps during rotation with a high fuel demand and fuel tanks not horizontal this could be an issue? What does everyone here think it would look like if all AC generators were shut down, in terms of engine performance - would you expect there to be a reduction in thrust? With the gear stuck down would that be serious enough?

      When we see the video, the airplane is still climbing / flying straight and level (not losing altitude), yet we hear what we think might be the RAT, I can't imagine that they had the kinetic energy to do this with no engines. if they had dual engine failure, they would have been a brick, Hot and High, no thrust, flaps 5, zero chance.
     </span>
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  How long does it take for an engine to fail in terms of thrust output - what does thrust over time look like for various failure scenarios - e.g., no electrically powered fuel pumps, or contaminated fuel, or thrust set to idle or other issues?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The original mobile video (not the copy from someones phone screen) clearly sounds like a RAT but what does the engine itself sound like - is it idle or reduced in some way?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  What is the minimum amount of thrust that would need to be lost to stop climbing and sink back down - it took 30 seconds from leaving the ground to impact from the CCTV and the first 15 was climbing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I would look carefully at the fact that the PCU still has the technical ability to tell all AC generator control units to turn off via software, as proven in the documented and fixed 248-day software issue.

     Anyone knows more about this reset evert 52 weeks?

  It is similar to the 248-day continuous power software bug on the 787. In both cases a counter in the software would overflow after an amount of time that would be proportional to something like the number of seconds, milliseconds or other unit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 248 day bug would cause the PCU to trigger
  <b>
   ALL 4 AC generator control units
  </b>
  to shut down. The fact that this is even possible in software alone is remarkable and should make any engineer concerned. The fact that this was only fixed in software with no redundant physical system (e.g. 1 or more AC units being independent of this system) is concerning. The fact that Boeing had a second software overflow error causing the 51 day directive should really have everyone discussing software as a possible cause for this crash.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  People may say that the engine driven pumps / suction feed / gravity feed would continue to power the engines but my understanding is the aircraft attitude and high fuel flow at takeoff could potentially mean less thrust than was needed if all 4 AC generators disconnected and stopped all AC fuel pumps during rotation.

     To my mind, this points to a potential software issue. 787s have already suffered from 2 separate software issues in which the passage of time causes a major and possibly catastrophic failure - the need to reboot systems before 51 days and 248 days have elapsed, due to poorly-written software. Given that history, the probability of there being a third, previously-unidentified but broadly similar in nature software issue seems surprisingly high. They aren't independent variables.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Such a passage-of-time software issue wouldn't show up in most (or possibly any) testing scenarios. It is the sort of issue that robust QA and static code analysis are designed to catch. But in at least two separate systems on the 787 it has not been caught prior to software shipping. Meanwhile, every new technical post demonstrates the myriad ways in which non-software potential causes are mitigated by redundant design.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The odds of two (or more) redundant mechanical systems failing in precisely the same way at precisely the same moment are very, very small. The odds of identical software on two (or more) redundant systems reaching a passage-of-time bug at precisely the same moment are, by contrast, very much higher. True redundancy would require different software on each redundant sub-system.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I am a software engineer, I find it alarming that the power control unit had the ability to command all AC generator control units to effectively shut down - regardless of that being the side-effect of a bug, or an ability of the system to call on in appropriate scenarios.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Integer overflow is a specific type of issue common to many systems, but like you said - it is something that should be found with robust QA and analysis. The ability to shut down all generators at once from a single source seems like a risky design decision to me and I agree with your point about different software on 2 or more redundant sub systems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  My theory is that this was an accepted risk because the engine-driven fuel pumps would be more than enough in most phases of flight to keep the engines running, and you would still have 2 engines for redundancy. The APU would also restore AC power in lets say 30 seconds and you would then have electric fuel pumps as well.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I think there are several factors that could explain how loss of all AC power during takeoff could lead to a crash:
  <ul>
   <li>
    The crash happened within 30 seconds - possibly too short for the APU to start, and the RAT doesn't power the AC electric fuel pumps
   </li>
   <li>
    The engine driven fuel pumps even if sufficient in level flight may have struggled during rotation - has Boeing tested an actual takeoff with only EDP feeding the engine while the fuel tanks are rotating and in extreme environments, or, have they only tested this statically?
   </li>
   <li>
    The takeoff was hot and heavy - combined with the landing gear stuck down and reduced thrust from loss of electric fuel pumps could this be enough?
   </li>
  </ul>

     MCAS wasn't "under the radar". The designers thought:
     <br/>
     * all MCAS can do is affect the trim
     <br/>
     * if something goes wrong with the trim, the crew works the "runaway trim" checklist
     <br/>
     * this cuts MCAS off from the trim
     <br/>
     * therefore, MCAS failure of any sort is going to be contained
     <br/>
     <br/>
     It just turned out that if a crew is stuck, shortly after takeoff, in an aircraft that wants to go down, and they have no clue why because "AOA disagree" indicators are considered a luxury item for Boeing and Boeing also did not want to train crews for this, the crew may not be in the right mindset to prioritise that checklist.
     <br/>
     Today, everyone is aware, so it's no longer an issue.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  There is a bigger issue here. The general public are more and more concerned that Boeing is cutting corners, and perhaps that is debatable and a complex balance of "how much do you want to pay for a plane ticket" vs "how absurdly close to diminishing returns can statistical probability get when dealing with some of the most complex machines and industries humanity has ever created".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  What isn't debatable is that MCAS was part of an initiative to save on regulatory and training costs. It was designed entirely because a regulatory environment existed where you could extend the fuselage to the point where you needed to mount engines in a way that would essentially make this no longer the same type, and probably not something that any aircraft designer would design fresh. Boeing, like everyone else, played within that framework, but Boeing didn't execute properly and the public optics are that they cut corners on top of cutting corners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I agree that engineering is all about tradeoffs but I don't think anything is "no longer an issue" because we had 2 disasters within a couple of years and learned from mistakes. There is an issue somewhere, maybe a systemic corporate issue, a
  <acronym title="Google Page Ranking">
   PR
  </acronym>
  issue, or just a Boeing issue - the Air India crash has the potential to make it far bigger.
