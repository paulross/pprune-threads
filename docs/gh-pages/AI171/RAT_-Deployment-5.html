     Why do you expect that? Are you in posession of the takeoff performance figures for this flight and the 2nd segment climb calculations? You are attributing something to not be possible simply due to an expectation that it can not be so?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     What do you expect that the clean maneuvering speed is when compared to takeoff flap in this instance?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     You may be right, you may be wrong. As may I - but to dismiss a potential and possible theory because you '
     <b>
      <i>
       expect
      </i>
     </b>
     ' that increasing thrust and AoA would be enough is quite short sighted!
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  <span style="color:#000000">
   With all due respect, based on the videos released so far, it appears the aircraft had no thrust\x97even without considering the sound of a deployed RAT. I could be mistaken, of course, but a flap/gear configuration error doesn\x92t strike me as a likely cause.

  In summary,
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Flaps were extended, possibly flaps 5 or 15. Looks like it in the video and clearly shown post crash.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Aircraft reached a height of just over 100\x92 AGL (possibly 200\x92 if you compare wingspan to height in videos)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  RAT was deployed. Seen on videos and heard conclusively.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Aircraft rotated at \x91usual\x92 spot. Comparing FR24 data from previous flights over the past week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Aircraft took off at \x91usual\x92 speed. Comparing other flights.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  FR24 data stopped being sent shortly after take off. Possibly indicating electrical fault.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Green and white flashing light reported by survivor. Possibly indicating electrical fault.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gear bogies were at unusual angle indicating Gear selected up and then interrupted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No smoke or flames to indicate bird strike. (Edit - still debate about this in the video above where the aircraft is behind a building)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No rudder input to indicate single engine failure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All speculation but hopefully a pretty balanced summary from the thread so far. It would be great if there was more focus now on what might have caused above rather than talking flaps, birds, 625\x92, etc.

  Misselection of flap, erroneous TO Performance data, dust = overrun, bird strikes\x85.all unlikely as none fit the evidence; the engines were very quiet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The clearest bit of evidence is the RAT deployment. As someone else pointed out gear bogey position indicates Gear UP cycle had commenced.
  <br/>
  So the most evidenced sequence of events was  rotation, positive rate = gear Up; \x85.catastrophic Power Loss. Flickering cabin emergency lights and Loud bang reported by survivor (was this heard RAT deployment or another system?).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 787 has some unique electrical/mechanical and air systems. Previous flight had issues (reported by passengers).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  So the root cause of the Power failure must be down to when either the 787 gets airborne (weight on wheels switch) or when Gear selected Up. I wonder if any 787 drivers could elaborate on what electric/hydraulic/air systems are affected at the very point of wheels up or gear up ?
  <br/>
  I\x92m wondering if the electrically powered cabin pressurisation system is affected at wheels up?

  In the take off video I think there is a subtle yaw to the right at lift off (the moment it begins being obscured by the building in the foreground). There is then a massive blast of dust on the airfield on the left side of the aircraft as it lifts off. Later video audio suggests the engines were not at full power ( or even operating - just wind noise) and that the RAT was whirring. It also shows the fuselage wheel bogies were tilted forward - so wheels up has commenced - but the gear doors are not open.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Possible sequence: right engine failure at rotation, firewalling of left engine, lift off and positive rate, gear up lever activated, wheels tilt forward, left engine failure, RAT deployed, insufficient hydraulics to Open gear doors to complete gear up sequence, ongoing dual engine failure?

     OK, another hour spent going through all the posts since I was on last night...
     <br/>
     I won't quote the relevant posts as they go back ~15 pages, but a few more comments:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     TAT errors affecting N1 power set: The FADEC logic (BTW, this is pretty much common on all Boeing FADEC) will use aircraft TAT if it agrees with the dedicated engine inlet temp probe -
     <i>
      but if they differ it will use the engine probe
     </i>
     . The GE inlet temp probe is relatively simple and unheated, so (unlike a heated probe) a blocked or contaminated probe will still read accurately - just with greater 'lag' to actual temperature changes.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     TCMA - first off, I have to admit that this does look rather like an improper TCMA activation, but that is very, very unlikely. For those who don't know, TCMA is a system to shutdown a runaway engine that's not responding to the thrust lever - basic logic is an engine at high power with the thrust lever at/near idle, and the engine not decelerating. However, TCMA is
     <i>
      only
     </i>
     active on the ground (unfamiliar with the 787/GEnx TCMA air/ground logic - on the 747-8 we used 5 sources of air/ground - three Radio Altimeters and two Weight on Wheels - at least
     <i>
      one of each
     </i>
     had to indicate ground to enable TCMA). TCMA will shutdown the engine via the N2 overspeed protection - nearly instantaneous. For this to be TCMA, it would require at least two major failures - improper air ground indication or logic, and improper TCMA activation logic (completely separate software paths in the FADEC). Like I said, very, very unlikely.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Fuel contamination/filter blockage: The fuel filters have a bypass - if the delta P across the filter becomes excessive, the filter bypasses and provides the contaminated fuel to the engine. Now this contaminated fuel could easy foul up the fuel metering unit causing a flameout, but to happen to two engines at virtually the same time would be tremendous unlikely.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Auto Thrust thrust lever retard - the TO lockup in the logic makes this very unlikely (it won't unlock below (IIRC) 400 ft., and even that requires a separate pilot action such as a mode select change or thrust lever movement). And if it did somehow happen, all the pilot needs to do is push the levers back up.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Engine parameters on the FDR: I don't know what exactly is on the 787 FDR with regards to engine parameters, but rest assured that there is plenty of engine data that gets recorded - most at one/second. Getting the FDR readout from a modern FDR is almost an embarrassment of riches. Assuming the data is intact, we'll soon have a very good idea of what the engines were doing
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  The speed at which there was a complete loss of thrust and electrical power degrading to the point of flickering lights and RAT deployment suggests to me an actual engine shutdown rather than anything linked to auto thrust or fuel contamination. There are not many things which can cause an engine to shut down: LP valves, FADEC incl TCMA, crew action\x85

     Some kind of thrust problem, whether real or incorrectly perceived, might have prompted for the DUAL ENG FAIL memory item being carried out. This calls for cutting off both engines and then on again.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <img alt="" class="post_inline_image" src="https://cimg3.ibsrv.net/gimg/pprune.org-vbulletin/387x572/screenshot_2025_06_13_124751_cd83327e47d2878fb8f4889838314f59c08ab20f.png"/>

  We're all shouting each other down with two main different theories on why the aircraft lost lift so shortly after takeoff.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  1) Incorrect flap retraction causing the aircraft to lose lift and unable to recover the energy in time. (Not unheard of and plenty of reports where this has happened - albeit usually not to a crash).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  2) Loss of engine thrust backed up two potential pieces of evidence that back up the RAT was deployed (apparent RAT sound, potential RAT seen on low res video).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is impossible to know which of these is the case. Considering this summary of memory items is there the potential for a combination of both theories to have taken place?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Inadvertant flap retraction by PNF leading the PF to sense a sink and loss of lift. Pushes the thrust levers forward to the firewall and still the aircraft sinks. PF looking through the HUD and so very much 'outside focused' and doesn't realise that PNF has instead moved the flaps. PF defaults to memory items for loss of thrust on both engines before PNF can realise or communicate to PF what they've done, start switches are cut off which drops the RAT and from that point they're only heading one way. This would satisfy the strongly held belief that the RAT was extended, whilst also following the more likely initial cause of an action slip by PNF starting the sequence, rather than a dual engine failure.

     Firstly, I don\x92t think an inadvertent selection of flaps up caused this accident. I think it\x92s a red herring that seemed plausible initially but it is not consistent with the RAT being deployed, and the evidence for the RAT is strong.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     To answer your broader question though, how could such an error happen? It happens because us simple humans learn how to do actions to the point where we don\x92t have to think about them anymore. This allows us to effectively automate routine tasks and save our brains for more novel tasks. The problem arises when we trigger the wrong automatic action in response to a cue. You ask for gear up, I know I need to select the gear up, I know where the gear handle is and what it looks and feels like, yet something goes wrong in the wiring of my body and instead, the flap-up automatic action is run. It\x92s run before I have consciously thought about it.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Sound far fetched? Well it has happened numerous times. I\x92ve seen someone do exactly that, select the flap instead of the gear, and there are incident reports publicly available. All modern passenger jets have a similar layout of the flap lever and the gear lever with the gear looking like a wheel and the flap looking like a wing, yet this error can still happen.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Have you ever gone to put something in the fridge that should\x92ve been put in the cupboard? I\x92d bet that most people have made that weird error at some point in their lives, and yet the fridge doesn\x92t look like the cupboard and they\x92re nowhere near each other.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Neurotypically an error in an automatic action will occur when the routine that encompasses that action is changed. Hence babies being left in back seats of cars, and probably a factor for the sterile flight deck rule. Any reason to think that might have been in play here?

  I agree it is helpful to seek a consensus on some of these matters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The most productive responses would be along the lines of:-
  <br/>
  (1) I too have read all previous posts and agree that your summary reflects the current consensus,
  <br/>
  (2) I too have read all previous posts and agree your summary reflects the consensus
  <i>
   HOWEVER
  </i>
  I challenge that consensus because... [ [i]EITHER (a) reference to previous post that merits greater credence,
  <i>
   OR
  </i>
  (b) new evidence supplied],
  <br/>
  (3) I too have read all previous posts but I do NOT agree your summary reflects the consensus [explanation required].
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is not necessary for everyone who thinks (1) to say it (although some initial feedback would be useful!). However, if any of the more experienced and informed PPRuNers are thinking either (2) or (3) then it would be instructive to hear that.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  FWIW, yours strikes me as a reasonable summary of the best consensus I have been able to discern (as of ~30 minutes ago). There are multiple caveats to each line item, but I presume you've deliberately left those out for the sake of readability, so I'll do the same!

  <br/>
  The only comments I would add are:-
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - It's a stretch to say the RAT is seen or heard "conclusively". Doubts have been expressed about the video quality and there are dissenting views regarding the audio. If a few more people were able to wade in on the audio point in particular, this could be very beneficial in moving the discussion forward because the presence or otherwise of the RAT is significant to several competing theories.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - On the subject of audio, I am surprised there has not been more discussion regarding engine noise. In the primary eye witness video the (alleged) RAT can be heard distinctly, as can the sounds of distant impact. If the engines were working as expected when overflying the camera and then flying directly away from it, do we really not think the engine noise would be more conclusive, i.e. louder (notwithstanding quiet engines and derated takeoffs)?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Whichever way readers are leaning in the flaps versus power loss debate, surely these two points are pivotal, and we have actual evidence available to discuss?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - Gear bogies: I'm not sure a consensus has yet been reached regarding the angle of the bogies. (I am not personally qualified to comment on this - I am purely saying I don't see a clear consensus just yet among those who are)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - Mayday call: I don't recall seeing a confirmed source for the widely reported mayday. Others have brought this up in the thread but nobody appears to be able to confirm one way or the other. If accurate, its contents are informative. Am I right to presume that you have left it out of your summary due to a lack of confirmation?

  The only other way the RAT can be deployed is manually, using the p/b on the overhead panel. Almost certainly this is a highly unlikely action given time &amp; distractions. But it is one possibility that needs examination and elimination in the data.

  I don\x92t give credence to any of his recollections. I do find the recorded sound of the RAT quite compelling after watching some other videos of a deployed RAT and hearing from the chap who hears them fly over while testing them every day. The photo of the section of wing in the wreckage with flaps still extended also puts paid to the other main theory, in my mind.

  Thanks for the response. All great points you raise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I simply forgot to mention the Mayday. I think there are enough sources to suggest one was made but I\x92m slightly wary of its content.
  <br/>
  The recording and rebroadcast of RT exchanges is illegal in India as it is in the U.K. so we can\x92t be sure until its official release.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gear bogies - This was also mentioned by Juan Browne/Blancolirio as something to focus on, that\x92s probably what swayed me on this.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I was initially in the gear up/flaps up camp but I\x92ve been impressed by the testimonies of others here, particularly by the poster who\x92s heard hundreds of these overhead and the several videos shared for comparison.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As you say, hopefully we can put most of these topics to bed now (unless there is contradictory new evidence) and focus instead on where Occam\x92s razor points us.

     We're all shouting each other down with two main different theories on why the aircraft lost lift so shortly after takeoff.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     1) Incorrect flap retraction causing the aircraft to lose lift and unable to recover the energy in time. (Not unheard of and plenty of reports where this has happened - albeit usually not to a crash).
     <br/>
     <br/>
     2) Loss of engine thrust backed up two potential pieces of evidence that back up the RAT was deployed (apparent RAT sound, potential RAT seen on low res video).
     <br/>
     <br/>
     It is impossible to know which of these is the case. Considering this summary of memory items is there the potential for a combination of both theories to have taken place?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Inadvertant flap retraction by PNF leading the PF to sense a sink and loss of lift. Pushes the thrust levers forward to the firewall and still the aircraft sinks. PF looking through the HUD and so very much 'outside focused' and doesn't realise that PNF has instead moved the flaps. PF defaults to memory items for loss of thrust on both engines before PNF can realise or communicate to PF what they've done, start switches are cut off which drops the RAT and from that point they're only heading one way. This would satisfy the strongly held belief that the RAT was extended, whilst also following the more likely initial cause of an action slip by PNF starting the sequence, rather than a dual engine failure.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Why the need to make the two theories fit in such a convoluted manner? Inadvertent flap retraction was theorised because people assumed that was most likely to have caused the loss of lift - hardly anyone believed dual engine failure was possible. Now we know that the loss of lift was indeed almost certainly caused by a loss of engine power, why all these awkward attempts to reverse engineer it to still fit the flap retraction theory? People need to realise they are only trying to make the flap retraction theory fit because of cognitive biases. If we had all been told immediately, there was dual power loss and the RAT deployed, no-one would even be considering flaps. Its confirmation bias of past assumptions, that's all.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As has been said many times as well, the landing gear retraction process appears to start as the bogies tilt, and then suddenly stops. Which rather suggests they did pull the gear lever. Based on the videos and the amount of speed the plane lost in the very brief sequence ovents, I'd say that the plane lost power a lot earlier than it would have in your theory.

 <div id="post_message_11900945">
  In my opinion ( and we all know the cliche about opinions ), there are only two plausible explanations.
  <br/>
  1. Dual engine failure/damage due to multiple bird strikes somewhere immediately after V2 and liftoff.
  <br/>
  Given the suddenness of the situation the gear could well have been overlooked by the PM who would be checking out the engine parameters only at this point in time. Flaps were in 5 position. No doubt about that.
  <br/>
  Take off thrust used was for Optimum thrust
  <br/>
  ( meaning minimum thrust for take off given runway and environmental conditions ). That accounts for the full runway length being used. This is policy. That means minimum thrust used for take off to meet 2nd segment climb gradient at almost MTOW.
  <br/>
  Loss of total thrust, RAT may or may not have deployed. At 650, AMSL no chance of any relight or turn back. Rest is history.
  <br/>
  This also corresponds to the thud heard by the survivor about 30 seconds after takeoff.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  2. Loss of thrust in only one engine and degraded performance in the other. Again, due to bird strike. Thereby not allowing even level flight.
  <br/>
  Gear staying down could have been overlooked by mistake OR left down intentionally forseeing an impending ground contact by PIC and trying to minimize damage to his airplane.
  <br/>
  Eitherways it added to additional drag and if anything, only accelerated the process of ground contact.
  <br/>
  Given the above conditions safe flight would have been close to impossible. If not completely impossible. He neither had the airspeed not the altitude to make a 180 or even look for a safer place to put her down.
  <br/>
  Refer the last Concorde flight/crash.
  <br/>

  A very very sad day for aviation indeed \x85 🙏

  Speaking as a B787 Captain..... There is so much rubbish and stupid suggestion being written here.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This aircraft was airborne for a grand total of 22 seconds, half of which was climbing to no more than 150' aal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - No Flaps? Due to the setup of the ECL it is physically impossible to go down the runway without some sort of take-off flap set. The T/o config warning would have been singing it's head off. Despite assertions to the contrary I have seen no video clear enough to detect a lack of flaps.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - RAT out? Almost impossible, I have seen no quality footage that definitively witnesses the RAT being out. Those who think they car hear a RAT type noise might be listening to a motorcycle passing or similar. It takes a triple hydraulic failure or a double engine failure to trigger RAT deploment. They happily went through V1 without a hint of rejected take off so as they rotated the aircraft was serviceable. These are big engines, they take a long time to wind down when you shut them down. I have never tried it however engine failure detection takes 30s or for the aircraft to react and they were not even airborne that long.
  <br/>
  - Flaps up instead of gear? The B787 flaps are slow both in and out. Given that the 'Positive rate' call is not made the second the wheels leave the ground, a mis-selection of flaps up would not cause any loss of lift for at least 20 seconds, by which time they had already crashed. I believe the gear remained down not because of mis-selection but because of a major distraction on rotate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Discounting the impossible, two hypotheses remain:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  1. Invalid derate set through incorrect cross-checking. Trundling down the runway takes very little power to reach Vr. It is only when you rotate that you create more drag and discover that you do not have sufficient thrust vs. drag to sustain a climb. Or....
  <br/>
  2. Put 200' as the altitude target in the FCU. Immediate ALT capture and all the power comes off. PF is still hand flying trying to increase pitch but is already way behind the aircraft.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It could be after this that Boeing are forced to review the B787 practice of exploring the very edges of the performance envelope.

  How would 'all the power come off' at 150ft AAL when the Autothrottle would still be in HOLD mode (until 400ft) and therefore be unable to move?

  And should't a genuine B787 captain know this?

  No argument on the flaps.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The engines, however: yes they take a long time to wind down
  <i>
   fully
  </i>
  , but they don't take long to stop providing thrust if you shut them down or cut the fuel (or indeed have a bird strike). I don't understand why you consider a loss of thrust to be an impossible hypothesis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There's also a still image above which appears to show a deployed RAT; that's even if we discount the sound track, which might indeed be something else than a RAT, and ignore the sound of the crash being clearly audible despite the lack of engine noise earlier in the video.

     Speaking as a B787 Captain..... There is so much rubbish and stupid suggestion being written here.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     This aircraft was airborne for a grand total of 22 seconds, half of which was climbing to no more than 150' aal.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     - No Flaps? Due to the setup of the ECL it is physically impossible to go down the runway without some sort of take-off flap set. The T/o config warning would have been singing it's head off. Despite assertions to the contrary I have seen no video clear enough to detect a lack of flaps.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     - RAT out? Almost impossible, I have seen no quality footage that definitively witnesses the RAT being out. Those who think they car hear a RAT type noise might be listening to a motorcycle passing or similar. It takes a triple hydraulic failure or a double engine failure to trigger RAT deploment. They happily went through V1 without a hint of rejected take off so as they rotated the aircraft was serviceable. These are big engines, they take a long time to wind down when you shut them down. I have never tried it however engine failure detection takes 30s or for the aircraft to react and they were not even airborne that long.
     <br/>
     - Flaps up instead of gear? The B787 flaps are slow both in and out. Given that the 'Positive rate' call is not made the second the wheels leave the ground, a mis-selection of flaps up would not cause any loss of lift for at least 20 seconds, by which time they had already crashed. I believe the gear remained down not because of mis-selection but because of a major distraction on rotate.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Discounting the impossible, two hypotheses remain:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     1. Invalid derate set through incorrect cross-checking. Trundling down the runway takes very little power to reach Vr. It is only when you rotate that you create more drag and discover that you do not have sufficient thrust vs. drag to sustain a climb. Or....
     <br/>
     2. Put 200' as the altitude target in the FCU. Immediate ALT capture and all the power comes off. PF is still hand flying trying to increase pitch but is already way behind the aircraft.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     It could be after this that Boeing are forced to review the B787 practice of exploring the very edges of the performance envelope.

     The RAT sounds to be deployed in some videos. Does the RAT deploy automatically on the B787?
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Please read this thread first before asking a question, it has been answered several times.
  <br/>
  Yes, the RAT will deploy automatically in the event of a loss of both AC Busses, both engines or all hydraulics.
  <br/>
  It can be deployed manually via a guarded push button switch on the overhead panel.

  Combining all the bits and pieces of info from this thread so far, IMO we can theoretically sequence it thus using the video from the left:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  00:18 Rotation. Normal takeoff config.
  <br/>
  00:24 Gear up starts. per Raffael with FF.
  <br/>
  ......... FR24 ADSB last transmission (71ft, 172kt) just before runway threshold. Matches with video aircraft altitude at 1/2 wingspan.
  <br/>
  ......... ? Full power flameout leaves N2 ~ 60%; Airspeed &lt; 200k so N2 will decay to 15% in 8-10s?
  <br/>
  ......... ? Takeoff EGT of 900C needs 25-35s to fall below 250C ?
  <br/>
  00:27 Gear up stops. per Raffael with FF. Bogies tilted.
  <br/>
  ......... ? APU starts. 20-55s to 95%N?
  <br/>
  ......... Per 787 dual-engine fail/stall memory items, PM initiates Fuel Cutoff and Run.
  <br/>
  00:28 Visible loss of thrust. Alt ~ 200ft using aircraft wingspan as measure.
  <br/>
  ......... Matches with eyewitness "within 5-10s ... it was stuck in the air".
  <br/>
  ......... Per 787 dual-engine fail/stall memory items, PM initiates RAT Switch for 1s. Whether auto or manual, the RAT initiates.
  <br/>
  ......... RAT "bang" heard by survivor
  <br/>
  ......... RAT coming online accounts for eyewitness "lights started flickering green and white".
  <br/>
  ......... Per 787 QRH below 1000ft, PF makes no change to Main Landing Gear and flaps, aircraft pointed straight for best glide.
  <br/>
  00:31 Descending visibly, somewhere beyond the runway threshold. Alt ~ 200ft using aircraft wingspan as measure.
  <br/>
  ......... ? Because EGT &gt; 250C FADEC blocks fuel (T-HOT hot restart inhibit?) so no relight though N2 &gt; 15% ?
  <br/>
  ......... 787 glide ratio between 16:1 to 25:1 with MLG down, Flaps 5. About 15-20s and 3-5000ft of glide from 200ft?
  <br/>
  ......... Some flap accounts for the ground pictures.
  <br/>
  00:34 ? N2 has presumably decayed to 15%, FADEC flips to X-START: airspeed outside envelope? No hope of relight now.
  <br/>
  ......... PM/PF transmits Mayday?
  <br/>
  ......... Video showing RAT deployed.
  <br/>
  00:46 APU reaches some fraction of 95%N (APU sound accounting for survivor's perception of thrust?).
  <br/>
  00:48 Impact. 4200ft from descent start, 3990ft from airport boundary road. 17s from visible descent start.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  if this is a valid sequence, the only remaining question is why the dual-engine failure at ~200ft agl?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  with condolences to the families and people affected.

  EVERY RAT automatically deploys under the right conditions usually loss of all electrics or all engines.  The C-5\x92s RAT dropped when 3 generators \x93in a row\x94 (1,2,3 or 2,3,4).  I can\x92t remember the Global but I thinks its loss of both AC generators.
