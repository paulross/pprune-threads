     Yeah but thought it worth discussing again IF we believe that the engine failure was caused by a pilot selecting both fuel control switches to cutoff. You\x92re right that I can\x92t imagine myself doing it but fear can make our inner chimps do strange things in response to the flight or flight response. (See the chimp paradox book).
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Or we could wait two more days because certainly that would be in the flight recorder data.

     PPRUNE could make a rule that all accident threads are locked until the final report is published when it can be discussed (I\x92m sure the mods have been tempted at times)! I suspect the website wouldn\x92t get many hits if it did\x85..

  I agree in principle, but it's not even a new theory, and the wait is just two days

  Seconds count:
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
   <i>
    As per the EAFR, the Engine 1 fuel cutoff switch transitioned from CUTOFF to RUN at about
   </i>
   <i>
    08:08:52 UTC. The APU Inlet Door began opening at about 08:08:54 UTC, consistent with the APU Auto Start logic. Thereafter at 08:08:56 UTC the Engine 2 fuel cutoff switch also transitions from CUTOFF to RUN. When fuel control switches are moved from CUTOFF to RUN while the aircraft is inflight, each engines full authority dual engine control (FADEC) automatically manages a relight and thrust recovery sequence of ignition and fuel introduction. The EGT was observed to be rising for both engines indicating relight.
    <b>
     Engine 1's core deceleration stopped, reversed and started to progress to recovery.
    </b>
    Engine 2 was able to relight but could not arrest core speed deceleration and re-introduced fuel repeatedly to increase core speed acceleration and recovery. The EAFR recording stopped at 08:09:11 UTC.
   </i>
   <br/>
  </div>
  That was with 10 seconds delay vs. 13 seconds for engine 2.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Time was spent with the verbal exchange, and then perhaps each pilot expected the other to put the switch back?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anyway, the preliminary report also establishes that the aircraft had only 3-4 seconds of powered flight. (Would the gear lever be operated that early?) Everyone who saw that from the CCTV video, pat yourselves on the back.

  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mayday call, dual engine failure, RAT deployment all confirmed.
  <br/>
  TCMA was a red herring, the aircraft was firmly in air mode as the accident unfolded, and the thrust levers were at takeoff thrust the whole time.

  Anyway, here goes:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A. Misconfiguration or wrong takeoff data &mdash;
  <b>
   OUT
  </b>
  : 5 tons under MTOW, flaps 5, takeoff roll uneventful
  <br/>
  <br/>
  B. Flaps retracted post-takeoff instead of gear &mdash;
  <b>
   OUT
  </b>
  : flaps 5 still set at crash
  <br/>
  <br/>
  C. Low-altitude capture &mdash;
  <b>
   OUT
  </b>
  : throttle was at take-off thrust the whole time
  <br/>
  <br/>
  D. Loss of both engines at or shortly after rotation &mdash;
  <b>
   IN: confirmed
  </b>
  to have occurred 3-4 seconds after liftoff
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I. Bird strike/FOD &mdash;
  <b>
   OUT
  </b>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  II.Fuel-related
  <br/>
  1. Loss of electric fuel pumps &mdash;
  <b>
   OUT
  </b>
  <br/>
  2. Fuel contamination &mdash;
  <b>
   as good as OUT
  </b>
  , but lab work is ongoing
  <br/>
  3. Vapour lock &mdash;
  <b>
   OUT
  </b>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  III. Improper maintenance &mdash; mostly
  <b>
   OUT
  </b>
  , switches might have been defective
  <br/>
  <br/>
  IV. Large-scale electrical fault (e.g. due to water in E&amp;E bay) &mdash;
  <b>
   OUT
  </b>
  . This would have been obvious from the flight recorder.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  V. Shutdown of engines by TCMA &mdash;
  <b>
   OUT
  </b>
  . Conditions not met (not on ground, throttle not at idle)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  VI. (Inadvertent) shutdown by flight crew
  <br/>
  1. Spontaneous execution of memory items (fuel control switches OFF, then ON; deploy RAT) due to assumed engine malfunction &mdash;
  <b>
   OUT
  </b>
  from CVR
  <br/>
  2. No indications whatsoever of an intentional shutdown for nefarious reasons &mdash;
  <b>
   IN but unsupported
  </b>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  VII. Malfunction/mishandling of the fuel cutoff switches (most recent)
  <br/>
  1. Wear or improper operation of the switches, so that they do not lock but can shift back into the OFF position. &mdash;

  2. Spilled drink leading to short in the wiring &mdash;

   Was the RAT deployed manually?
  </b>
  <br>
   The report says,
   <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
    <i>
     As per the EAFR data both engines N2 values passed below minimum idle speed, and the
    </i>
    <i>
     RAT hydraulic pump began supplying hydraulic power at about 08:08:47 UTC.
    </i>
   </div>
   This was 5 seconds after the fuel was cut off.
   <br>
    <br>
     It suggests to me that the RAT deployment was initiated while the engines were still above idle and generating electrical power. Obviously one of the pilots could have done it via depressing the switch, as it's a "dual engine failure/stall" memory item (see
     <a href="https://www.pprune.org/accidents-close-calls/666581-air-india-ahmedabad-accident-12th-june-2025-part-2-a-70.html#post11918946" target="_blank">
      Air India Ahmedabad accident 12th June 2025 Part 2
     </a>
     ) that won't hurt anything.
     <br>
      <br>
       Is there a way for the RAT to deploy while the engines are still above idle?

  the RAT can be deployed manually, and I believe a pilot did that here before power was lost.
