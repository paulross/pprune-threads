     For an aircraft that will likely have TOGA pressed and be at a high power setting (plus the RAT deployed) it sounds awfully quiet.
     <br/>
     Perhaps the gear was down because they knew they were going to force land due to lack of thrust.
     <br/>
     (Only a 738 driver), but the electric pumps to drive the hydraulics is much slower than the engine driven pumps and so flap selection / re-selection could be not as expected.
     <br/>

     RIP to all involved.

  787 gear and flaps/slats are both on the centre system, powered by 2x
  <i>
   big
  </i>
  electric pumps and no EDPs, so retraction should be minimally impacted by engine failure assuming electric power was still available and reconfiguration worked. Note the 787 has two generators per engine so generator failure is also unlikely to contribute, unless both engines failed taking out all four generators (and presumably no APU running).

     Assuming we're not facing a repeat of the Boeing 737‑800 crash at Muan International Airport when loss of loss of both engines apparently also cut power to Flight Data Recorder (FDR) and Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR)

  From that thread, I believe it was discussed that on most/all other large transports, deploying the RAT re-powers the CVR/FDR. The 737 didn't have that happen because no RAT. You may still get a few second gap while the RAT deploys.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 787 has 2x Enhanced Airborne Flight Recorders (EAFR), which each record both cockpit voice and flight data.
  <strike>
   I expect they are also fitted with the dedicated batteries that the Jeju was a year or two too early to require.

     Also, what is this discussion about the RAT? Unless someone has extremely quickly faked the audio on the video, it is pretty clear that the engines were running. (Both of them, there is some slight interference pattern I (maybe imagine) to hear.

  The suggestion is that the buzzsaw/propeller sound is the RAT; it does sound a bit like an interference pattern, but you don't get the engine roar with it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's also maybe visible in a few stills (e.g. post 64).

  Just to confirm.
  <br/>
  The 787 is an aircraft which likes to, performance wise, use all of the available runway for takeoff. Sometimes you can be sat in the 787 and as you are rolling down the runway, you start wondering if Rotate has been called or not. It loves taking up all of the runway.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nevertheless, there are some interesting speculations over on X. One guy even claimed the Captain was in the lavatory during the accident...
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many people have noted what appears to be the RAT deployed in the video footage suggesting dual engine failure. Possible wrong engine shutdown? But who diagnoses and actions an engine failure and shutdown below 400ft?

  I'm not convinced the RAT is out. I've looked several times and can't see it on any of the videos.

  The entire flight from rotation to impact was 30 seconds. Is it even possible to complete an engine shutdown in that time?

  You certainly should try that\x92s for sure. ANC and all that good stuff! In a panic it certainly is possible to just pull the wrong one. I\x92m not saying that\x92s what\x92s happened, to me it seems like dual engine failure, practically simultaneously.

     What is the precise trigger for the RAT to deploy automatically on the 787? Full failure of both engines?
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  In flight, the RAT deploys automatically if any of the following occur:
  <br/>
  &bull; both engines have failed
  <br/>
  &bull; all three hydraulic system pressures are low
  <br/>
  &bull; loss of all electrical power to captain&rsquo;s and first officer&rsquo;s flight
  <br/>
  instruments
  <br/>
  &bull; loss of all four EMPs and faults in the flight control system occur on
  <br/>
  approach
  <br/>
  &bull; loss of all four EMPs and an engine fails on takeoff or landing
  <br/>
  <br/>
  (EMP = electric motor pump, hydraulic)
  <br/>
  FYI the RAT is an emergency source for electrical and/or hydraulic power.

     nothing was normal the plane rotated right at the end of the runway far too late and barely climbed at all for 10 seconds before falling 20 seconds and finally crashing 30 seconds after take off.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The most obvious answer is low power/flaps setting if the engines were weird they would have probably aborted take off. Bird strike/engine issue during take off roll after v1? Super unlikely but never say never
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  An aircraft using derated thrust will use most of the runway to reach V1. It's not far too late. The initial climb looks normal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If the flaps weren't set then the aircraft would have accelerated on the runway faster, not slower. But I don't think the flaps were set wrong, or retracted early. The flaps appear extended in the video and the post crash photo. Why do you think a bird strike after V1 is unlikely? If you fly into a flock of birds a double engine failure is no less likely then a single failure. My initial thought watching the first video this lunchtime was power loss in both engines, probably bird strikes. I still think that.

     Delta airlines had a Captain do this in 1986 on a 757 out of LAX. Came within a few hundred feet of ditching. Then flew all the way to CVG with the rat hanging out!
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Not 757 - it was a 767. Second time it happened in about 12 months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Determined to be an ergonomics problem with the switch layout in the flightdeck.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Early 767s (JT9D and CF6-80A) had a supervisory "EEC" (Electronic Engine Control - Boeing still uses "EEC" to identify what most people call the FADEC on modern engines). The procedure if an EEC 'failed' was to switch both EECs off (to prevent excessive throttle stagger - unlike FADEC, the engine could operate just fine with a supervisory EEC failed).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Problem was that the EEC ON/OFF switch was located on the aisle stand - right above the fuel cutoff switches. Turned out 'muscle memory' was when the pilot reached down there, it was usually to turn the fuel ON or OFF - which is what they did. Fortunately realizing what he'd done wrong, the pilot quickly restored the switches to RUN and both engines recovered. And yes, they continued on to their destination (RAT was still deployed since there is no way to retract it in-flight).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Previous event was with JT9D engines (United IIRC). In that case, only one engine recovered (second engine went into an unrecoverable stall), they simply came back around and did a single engine landing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Realizing the ergonomic issue, the EECs were relocated to the pilot's overhead (retrofit by AD).

  To the best of my knowledge, there hasn't been a repeat of an inadvertent dual engine shutdown since the EEC switches were relocated. It's also very difficult to 'accidentally' move the switches as there is a locking detent - the switch must be pulled out slightly before it can be moved to CUTOFF.

     I am very sure the only variant of the 757/767 that had a RAT was the 767-400, which was not in production in 1986. I flew the 767-200 and -300 with 3 different engine combinations (around 30-40 different airframes and 2 airlines) and none of them had a RAT.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Happy to be corrected if this model 757 (or 767 as someone in a later post says) had a RAT.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Sorry but you are wrong.  The RAT was basic on the 767 - every single 767 built has one.  The Gimli glider deployed the RAT (1982), and the Delta dual engine shutdown out of LAX deployed the RAT.

     People on here seem convinced the RAT was deployed because they\x92ve seen it/heard it so many times before. They may be right. But if they are, then it means the RAT has deployed countless times before without both engines having failed, so it doesn\x92t definitively tell us anything.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  As has already been pointed out, these deployments were deliberate for test purposes and the approaches were done into airfields used by manufacturers for trials. Unless the Air India crew thought it would be fun to see what happened if they deployed the RAT shortly after takeoff, we are looking at something triggered by one or more of:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  System-wide electrical issues
  <br/>
  Double engine failure
  <br/>
  Selection of fuel switch and/or fire switch on both engines
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Any speculation about gear, flap, runway, etc. is redundant if the RAT did auto-deploy as it points to a very serious technical issue with the airframe rather than what was done with thrust levers or what the pilots had for breakfast.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I haven\x92t seen what the 787 cockpit looks like on battery power only but on the 777 it gets pretty dark with only the essential P1 instruments and VHF1 available until the RAT comes online, which is a measurable amount of time after deployment is triggered.

     One example of fuel contamination causing a significant loss of thrust on both engines at low altitude.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     But it seems extremely unlikely for contaminated fuel to impact both engines at
     <i>
      exactly
     </i>
     the same time, with no asymmetry and no surges or smoke.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     What can cause a sudden catastrophic loss of thrust on both engines at exactly the same time?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Birds (but no apparent surges)
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Inadvertent movement of the fuel cut off switches (which would be an incredible error but I suppose it could conceivably be muscle memory having done so recently after the last leg&hellip;weirder things have happened. Remember the 767 events of the late 80s)
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Intentional shutdown of the engines (pilot suicide has happened before)
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Some catastrophic electrical/FADEC/engine interface failure (which I highly doubt is feasible in a modern 1309 aircraft)
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I can&rsquo;t think of any others&hellip;
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  This seems to be the best summary so far. Based on the detail of the mayday its probably time to rule out the flaps, load shift, and other suggestions. Latest news is a quote from the survivor:
  <i>
   "
   <span style="color:#000000">
    Suddenly, the lights started flickering &ndash; green and white &ndash; then the plane rammed into some establishment that was there"
   </span>
  </i>
  <span style="color:#000000">
   .
  </span>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I cant think of any reason for electrical failure and "no thrust" (as per statements) without any visual cues other than (a) suicide, or (b) starvation. Is there any electrical failure that can cause fuel valves to close? I dont fly Boeing, so can any Dreamliner driver explain what conditions could trigger an overspeed and auto engine shutdown (quote from Google below)? Would short runway, and hot/low QNH do it? Also, what happened to the order demanding a full power down/recycle every 51 days?
  <br/>
  <br/>

  I didn\x92t think this could be a dual engine failure related accident until reports of RAT deployment started to gather steam.

  A few years back a B787 previously had a dual engine shutdown after rollout when the TR was deployed too quickly and not allowing the air/GND logic time to transition to ground mode before the TR deployed. If the TCMA had inadvertently latched the TR deployment from the previous rollout then it theoretically could be possible to shutdown on transition back to air mode.

  SLF.  I don\x92t know how B787 systems work but if that\x92s correct it must be a possibility.  It seems as though engines are working fine until airborne.  I\x92d just been asking elsewhere if it were possible that an electrical fault with the software could prevent both engines running? I know they don\x92t require outside power to continue to run, but if software was disrupted by a catastrophic electrical fault (issues reported on previous flight supposedly) would they shut down? But an error in the software could be more likely than the sort of failure requiring multiple backups to also fail I guess, and would also explain the timing of the engines shutting down/throttling back.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  RIP to all the victims.

  Many GE engines - including GEnx-1B/67s - require microprocessors to be routinely replaced due to soldered joints failing after multiple cycles. There is a 2021 AD that notes
  <i>
   "This AD was prompted by an in-service occurrence of loss of engine thrust control resulting in uncommanded high thrust"
  </i>
  (I cannot post a link but google: 2021-25491 (86 FR 66447))
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I am NOT suggesting that this specific failure mode happened here - for one thing, this would happen to one engine, not both. But on any flight it is possible that a unique set of sensor inputs to occur that are the first time any system has encountered them (example: NATS incident in 2023), and then you need failover &amp; redundancy to keep things working.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The GE Aviation CCS system, which includes thrust management, has up to now flown for 1m flight hours without incident. It would be interesting to hear the perspectives of any engineers familiar with the system.

  Presumably a dual engine shutdown under TMCA (i.e. similar to the ANA incident) would cause the RAT to deploy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Obviously difficult to envisage what could cause an TMCA activation on both engines simultaneously given the safeguards in place (weight on wheels etc). However maybe the time delay from an erroneous TMCA activation on the runway/at rotation would lead to a loss of power 10 seconds later.

     A few years back a B787 previously had a dual engine shutdown after rollout when the TR was deployed too quickly and not allowing the air/GND logic time to transition to ground mode before the TR deployed. If the TCMA had inadvertently latched the TR deployment from the previous rollout then it theoretically could be possible to shutdown on transition back to air mode.
     <br/>
     Anything is possible with these high tech machines.

  Just to clarify one point: the ANA B787 was powered with RR Trent 1000 engines while the Air India had
  <span style="color:#1e2837">
   GEnx-1B67 engines.
   <br/>
   So, the Air India thrust failure may still have its source in the TCMA system, however, if it's the case, the logical path must be somewhat different than for the thrust reversers of the ANA airplane.
