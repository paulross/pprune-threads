  Short introduction on faults:
  <br>
   <br>
    There are systematic and random faults.
    <br>
     Mechanics and SW only know systematic faults, only electronic HW does have random faults.
     <br>
      Why?
      <br>
       Mechanics are large enough to react in a reproduceable manner, SW too (on working HW).
       <br>
        Worn out part? -&gt; systematic fault, you did not calculate wear correctly in your analysis, adding maintainance cycles
        <br>
         Broken nut due to too much torque? -&gt; systematic fault, you did not analyse the severity and put QM measures in place within maintainance.
         <br>
          broken fan blade due to corrosion? -&gt; systematic fault, incorrect testing and environment assumption, other fan blades may be corroded, too
          <br>
           SW crash every 10 years? -&gt; systematic fault, you did not make it robust against some nasty timing circumstance or race condition.
           <br>
            So systematic faults do not mean they happen instantly, they may happen never or after dozens of years. Not on all parts but e.g. just if there is a problem in production like a cavity in aluminum casting.
            <br>
             But there are systematic ways to avoid them (FMEA, FTA...). This is why every accident is analyzed. If it was a systematic fault, other party could be affected.
             <br>
              This also counts for SW, there are techniques to avoid errors on all levels of development. But having the same SW with the same inputs and the exact same timing will give the same outcome (...on both engines).
              <br>
               <br>
                Random faults are unique to electronic HW. The reason is just because of miniaturization. One cannot exclude migration and degradation on such small scales, there will be faulting transistors or other parts. If you scale them bigger, your processor runs on kHz instead of MHz, this is not an option. Those are random HW faults. There are calculation methods (FMEDA) to calculate the expected lifetime and error probability over the expected temperature profile. But if you give the faulting part the same input, it will show the fault again. But not any other part without the degraded transistor will give you the same error.
                <br>
                 And there are soft faults (not SW faults, soft faults), those are not reproducible at all. Imagine some hard x-ray from the sky hitting a DRAM cell and changing it's state. You will never be able to reproduce this hard x-ray which made it's way thru the atmosphere without interaction hitting exactly the right \xb5m\xb3 to do the same bit-flip again. You can just have redundancy in information and processing (ECC, parity, lock-step etc.) to have enough probability to detect (and reset) or correct the fault.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Faults, no matter if systematic or random can be single, multiple, latent and dependent faults.
                 <br/>
                 Single fault: a single error leads to a hazardous state
                 <br/>
                 Multiple point fault: more than one (independent) error will lead to a hazardous state
                 <br/>
                 Latent fault: a fault which remains undetected for some time (e.g. only detectable during startup / power-on) and not hazardous by itself. But together with a second fault it will lead to a hazardous event. But the probability of 2 errors within a power cycle is sufficiently low.
                 <br/>
                 Dependent fault: A fault, by itself not hazardous which will influence the probability of a second fault with both in combination... exactly. (-&gt; freedom from interference not given)
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Having the same SW bug on both engines would fall within the dependent fault category. Redundancy only helps if freedom from interference is given.
                 <br/>
                 So if there is a fault in SW and both FADEC instances get the same input and have the same timing, they will react the same way. If there is a hidden systematic fault, both will show it. This is why things are often programmed twice by independent teams or on different processors. They will not do the exact same mistake. Or there is a normal function and a supervisor like TCMA. One complex function but a tiny, easy to analyze supervisor just checking for the hazardous state.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 All this can be analyzed and is really lots of work but necessary. So first there is an analysis how severe a fault would be on a high level, this defines the necessary level of analysis in detail.
                 <br/>

     Just in case it wasn't obvious, JustusW managed to make an excellent point twice in their post about FPGA's, software and bugs.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The above code has a bug, which I assume was deliberate in order to see how many of us were really reading what they had to say, and to drive that home. Well done you, it is a simple illustration of just how easy it is for issues to slip through and not be noticed.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     While this simple bug would have been picked up early on by a compiler there could well be other much more esoteric and subtle bugs that could take years in operation and require a very specific set of circumstances before they trip. I make no comment or assertion that's the case here for AI 171, but it is worth bearing in mind in any search for understanding and cause.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     FP.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Mmm. Yes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To be clear, this is 'happily' executed in
  <i>
   perl
  </i>
  , and doesn't give the results you might expect.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  if ( happy == false ) {
  <br/>
  print("I'm happy!")
  <br/>
  }
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A FADEC might faithfully implement the logic of the design, Someone might even have spent a lot of resources to
  <i>
   formally prov
  </i>
  e that the FADEC logic implements the specification. The trouble is, that does not tell you that the specification is
  <i>
   correct
  </i>
  .
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Additionally, even if the specification is correct, it is possible to be implementing the code on flawed hardware.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is
  <i>
   not impossible
  </i>
  that a common set of inputs* triggered an unusual FADEC response in separate FADECs: however, not impossible does not mean that it is
  <i>
   likely
  </i>
  .
  <br/>
  <br/>
  *For example, the FADEC could be programmed to expect an input value to be a positive integer e.g. for altitude. If the device that sends the altitude value to the FADEC sends a negative value, one of several things might happen: (1) it could be rejected as being out of range. (2) It could be replaced with the lowest possible positive value: +0 (3) It could interpret the signed integer it has been given as an unsigned integer and treat it as an unrealistically large positive value.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I am
  <i>
   not
  </i>
  saying this is what has happened. Getting disagreement in the format of values sent between differing systems is not an unknown problem. Software problems as a result of poor, or differing interpretations of specifications have hit many high-profile projects: such as the
  <a href="https://sma.nasa.gov/news/safety-messages/safety-message-item/lost-in-translation" target="_blank">
   Mars Climate Orbiter
  </a>
  and the
  <a href="http://file:///home/pgrb/Downloads/safetymessage-2006-02-01-ariane5-vits.pdf" target="_blank">
   Ariane 5
  </a>
  - so I will not say that a system that includes FADECs cannot have problems: rather, that problems are
  <i>
   unlikely
  </i>
  .

     That\x92s the nature of a common mode bug. If the software was vulnerable to Mars being in the house of Uranus, the scent of lilacs and the DOW being less than 42,000 then you\x92d expect the failure to occur everywhere when these conjoined. Same when an aeroplane\x92s systems and/or the environment present data that triggers an unplanned/unforeseen response in something like an EEC/FADEC. The experts still appear to think that this is unlikely but we have been presented with an unlikely occurrence...
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I have to both agree and disagree with both this and the next post by TryingToLearn.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yes, there may be (let's assume is) "identical" FADEC/TCMA hardware and firmware on both engines, but if the Left Engine is subject to Mars in the house of Uranus (wink wink), then the Right Engine cannot be, maybe it's Venus in the same House. This is simply because the Left engine TCMA 'contraption', I'm going to call it, is monitoring Left Engine Conditions (Shaft Speed, T/L setting / position data - Right or Wrong, and calculating and comparing accordingly against its internal map) while the opposite TCMA "device" is monitoring and calculating etc, Right Engine Conditions. There are some things in common, but (I say) it's virtually impossible for the Engine Conditions being individually monitored to be identical in both engines.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Thrust Levers are electro-mechanical devices, almost certainly at this stage pushed by a somewhat squishy human hand, likely with a slight offset. What is the probability that those two levers are in identical positions, and even if they are, that the calibration (e.g. "zero points") of both levers are identical, and that the values they output (response slopes/curves) are exactly matching in every matching point in their individual travels? That's just one aspect, but consider the engines. They are different ages. Have different amounts of wear. They have separate fuel metering valves (or other names), separate HP Fuel pumps (and, I guess relief valves?), all also subject to wear), and each has a host of other, correspondingly paired, sensors, (maybe of different makes and certainly of different ages and different calibrations and response curves) from which each FADEC, supposedly independently of the TCMA, adjusts the fuel metering device settings and resulting engine power, and shaft RPMs follow in some other slightly non-matching way.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sure, I would completely agree that the two engines and their calculated Throttle Lever positions to Shaft RPMs are always going to be similar during normal, matched operation, and they will very likely dance with each other, maybe one 'always' (75% of the time, say) leading during one dance (TO, say) with the other leading in dancing to a different tune (descent, say).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To me, the fact that this appears to have been an almost simultaneous dual engine failure, pretty much, for me, rules out a FADEC/TCMA firmware bug, especially as there don't seem to be any reports of even a single engine mid-air TCMA shutdown.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  HOWEVER, and I want to stress this, that doesn't rule out the possibility that both TCMAs shutdown their respective engines simultaneously. Any lack of simultaneity observed would be due to those slight differences in other pieces of hardware, such as the time for one Shutoff valve to close versus the other.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As far as I know, there isn't enough information on what's actually inside those TCMA Black Boxes to say anything for sure, but here's a thought, which I think has been alluded to, or the question asked, here in one or other thread, earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  What does the TCMA firmware do when an engine is already running at a high power setting and TWO things occur in quick succession?  I suspect this kind of event is a highly probable cause, but these two events have not occurred close enough together, or ever, before.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Imagine this: Plane taking off, Throttle Levers near Full Power, Engines performing correctly, also near Full Power, Rotation etc all normal, plane beginning to climb, positive rate achieved.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pilot calls GEARUP. GearUp, activated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Gear Retract sequence begins. Due to some unforeseen or freshly occurring (maybe intermittent short or open circuit) linkage between the gear Up sequence and the WOW or Air/Ground System, the signal to both TCMAs suddenly switches to GROUND. All "good", so far, as the engine RPMs match the Throttle Lever settings and TCMA doesn't flinch. The plane could be in a Valid Takeoff sequence, so it had better not!  But it does make a bit of sense. How is WOW / Air/Ground detected? Somewhere near the Landing Gear, I assume.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  HOWEVER, now, a moment later, and perhaps due to a related system response, the Thrust Levers suddenly get pulled back to Idle, whether by man or Machine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  What would you expect the TCMA system to do? I would guess, fairly soon thereafter, two, independent, Fuel Cutoffs... Though I fully admit, I'm guessing based on a severe lack of knowledge of that Firmware.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ok, no need for further explanation on that point, but I did refer to TCMA unflatteringly as a contraption, earlier. Last night (regrettably, before bed) I started looking at the TCMA Google Patent. Let's just say, so far, I'm aghast! My first impressions are bad ones. How did this patent even get approved?  What I suspect here, now, is not a Firmware bug, but a serious Logic and Program Defect. But we'd have to see what's inside the firmware.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When I get more time, I'll dig deeper.

  , I think this has been covered, especially re the engines, in some depth already. Several who post here have extensive knowledge in FADEC and associated protections. It's all a mystery tbh and I guess we just need to wait now until some concrete evidence is produced by the AAIB.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Not wishing to dampen enthusiasm to find out a cause but, 2 Threads in, no-one is much the wiser. Just my opinion but that seems to be where we are. What a dreadful accident - I can't even begin to imagine what the crew went through in those final moments.

     This has also been touched upon earlier in the thread, but it rather seems the cut-off switches are in the same LRU, in close proximity, using the same connector and goes through the same wiring harness. No one was able to say whether it works purely by digital signaling, and goes through any common software, or if it is duplicated by purely direct signaling. There might be numerous failure modes of the cut-off switch design, it is obviously very, very robust and overall sound, since dual failures here have never happened, but this is alredy an outlier event.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Again, disclaimer that my direct knowledge of the 787 specifics is limited, standard Boeing design practice is that all engine wiring is segregated between engines (and were practical, between FADEC channels).
  <br/>
  The fuel switches are located adjacent to each other; however all the wiring would be separate.

     Separate would seem to be a relative term, ofcourse wires are separated in some way, but how separate? Do they share a quick connect? Are there 2 separate looms each side of the throttle installation, or are thety in some twisted bundle together. Someone on this thread claimed the fuel cut offs where inhibited if the throttles weren\x92t in idle. Is this true? If so, is this a software or mechanical system?
     <br/>
     Can anything so closely placed together be considered separate when looking at an outlier event?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Everyone is looking for something that would shut off both engines at the exact same time. This installation could, it is the closest the 2 systems get in proximity, physically and electrically, at least and it seems we don\x92t know a whole lot about it.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Engine isolation means just that.  No common wire bundles, no common connectors.  You can move the fuel levers at any time - there is no lockout of any kind with respect to thrust lever position (imagine dropping something into the lever linkage that jams the thrust lever at max power - then being unable to shut that engine down?)
  <br/>
  Obviously, since the thrust levers are placed next to each other - the separation that's available in the center console is limited, but as soon as the wiring exits that constrained area, the separation increases.  Furthermore, the same engine-to-engine wiring separation also applies to channel A/B FADEC channels, as well as the fuel switch/fire handle wiring.
  <br/>
  All these requirements are documented in the Boeing DR&amp;O (Design Requirements and Objectives) - and there is an audit done late in the design process to insure compliance.
  <br/>
  In short, you're barking up a tree stump - there is nothing there.

     Thank you for that answer, edge cases do abound in complex systems, but would not moving the throttles forward by hand (as the thrust was beginning to reduce {for that strange reason}) overcome that and restore thrust?
     <br/>
     (As I don't fly the 787, I may be missing something basic on how the systems work).
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I too don't fly that plane or any other FADEC plane for that matter, so I'll leave that to others. I keep thinking of the DA-42 that killed both engines due to an odd circumstance they didn't think would happen. It was a gross example of a corner case, but you can have other ones much harder to root out.

  This could be several issues aligning to cause the loss of thrust. If the new engine was installed and the synchronisation step was omitted by maintenance staff and the engines had different CPU/software versions then there could be an emergent failure mode when maximum thrust is applied resulting in a FADEC rollback. Almost impossible to anticipate and create that in a test scenario. Don't overlook that the pilot moving thrust levers to override rollback will be ignored by the software, if the FADEC has flipped into protective mode.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That said, the continued absence of the FAA issuing an Emergency Airworthiness Directive for the Dreamliner suggests to me the fault was something like contaminated fuel which was specific to that flight.

  However, a roll back on its own to idle would not give the evidenced gear behaviour nor the RAT (I happen to concur that the RAT was deployed and probably automatically). Given the gear tilt, it is safe to assume no engine is at idle, the normal electrical systems are not functioning at all.

  The idea is to set the switch to CUTOFF and then to ON as that resets the FADEC (the circuit that controls the engine) and hopefully clears any issues it might have. The hope is that the turbine is still rotating fast enough for the FADEC to restart it. I believe this works the same as the auto-relight feature.
  <br/>
  The turbine rotation would also provide the electrical power for that.
  <br/>

  Do a thread search on "detent" to learn more about the construction of these switches than you ever wanted to know.

  Unfortunately the wikipost linking to it is gone, presumably a victim to the recent forum changes.

     One thing that I remember from when I was a simulator TRI/TRE on a Boeing was that as an instructor you get very used to operating critical
     <br/>
     switches rapidly without following any procedure, in order to set the sim up for a single engine landing etc. When I was then line flying next I had to guard against doing the same thing in the real aircraft.

  Muscle memory is a strange and (usually) wonderous thing.  It allows us as humans to perform amazing things without actually thinking about what we are doing.  Professional Athletes have perfected this to a high art, but the rest of us do things using muscle memory on a regular basis.  Back when I was still racing, I happened to look down at my hands on the steering wheel in fast, bumpy corner, and I was simply amazed at the large, rapid steering inputs that I was making to compensate for the bumps - with absolutely zero conscious thought. Muscle memory at its best.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, it can also bite us.  The Delta dual engine shutdown during takeoff from LA (referenced way back when in the 1st accident thread) was caused by muscle memory - the pilot reached down to set the EEC switches (located near the fuel On-Off switches) but muscle memory caused him to do something else - set both fuel switches to OFF.  Fortunately, he quickly recognized his error, placing the switches back to RUN and the engines recovered in time to prevent a water landing (barely).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is conceivable that a pilot - reaching down to the center console to adjust something unrelated - could have muscle memory cause him to turn the fuel off to both engines.  While all new engines are tested for "Quick Windmill Relight" - i.e. the fuel switch is set to CUTOFF with the engine at high power - and the engine must recover and produce thrust withing a specified time (memory says 60 or 90 seconds) - it takes a finite amount of time for the engines to recover (spool down after a power cut at high power is incredibly fast - plus moving the switch to CUTOFF causes a FADEC reset, which means it won't do anything for ~ 1 second).  Doing that at a couple hundred feet and the chance that an engine will recover and start producing thrust before ground impact is pretty much zero

  It would be a lot more conceivable if the pilot had been practicing this action in a simulator recently.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's ironic that cognitive science arguably started with 'The Cambridge Cockpit'; an attempt to make sense of, and mitigate, pilots doing this sort of thing when tired, stressed and so on.  This kick started an ergonomics revolution which appears to have come full circle.  Now we have cognitive science offering Bayesian accounts of neural function that might explain how innocent but unfortunate priming of 'muscle memory' when practicing for emergencies could, almost predictably, lead to this sort of complex, protection overriding, error.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As non consciously executing a complex, well practiced, but unintended, action is a fairly common experience in less critical situations, I'm surprised that there isn't already a more effective ergonomic fix than the safety switches fitted.
