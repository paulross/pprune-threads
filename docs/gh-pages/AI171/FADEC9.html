  Short introduction on faults:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There are systematic and random faults.
  <br/>
  Mechanics and SW only know systematic faults, only electronic HW does have random faults.
  <br/>
  Why?
  <br/>
  Mechanics are large enough to react in a reproduceable manner, SW too (on working HW).
  <br/>
  Worn out part? -&gt; systematic fault, you did not calculate wear correctly in your analysis, adding maintainance cycles
  <br/>
  Broken nut due to too much torque? -&gt; systematic fault, you did not analyse the severity and put QM measures in place within maintainance.
  <br/>
  broken fan blade due to corrosion? -&gt; systematic fault, incorrect testing and environment assumption, other fan blades may be corroded, too
  <br/>
  SW crash every 10 years? -&gt; systematic fault, you did not make it robust against some nasty timing circumstance or race condition.
  <br/>
  So systematic faults do not mean they happen instantly, they may happen never or after dozens of years. Not on all parts but e.g. just if there is a problem in production like a cavity in aluminum casting.
  <br/>
  But there are systematic ways to avoid them (FMEA, FTA...). This is why every accident is analyzed. If it was a systematic fault, other party could be affected.
  <br/>
  This also counts for SW, there are techniques to avoid errors on all levels of development. But having the same SW with the same inputs and the exact same timing will give the same outcome (...on both engines).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Random faults are unique to electronic HW. The reason is just because of miniaturization. One cannot exclude migration and degradation on such small scales, there will be faulting transistors or other parts. If you scale them bigger, your processor runs on kHz instead of MHz, this is not an option. Those are random HW faults. There are calculation methods (FMEDA) to calculate the expected lifetime and error probability over the expected temperature profile. But if you give the faulting part the same input, it will show the fault again. But not any other part without the degraded transistor will give you the same error.
  <br/>
  And there are soft faults (not SW faults, soft faults), those are not reproducible at all. Imagine some hard x-ray from the sky hitting a DRAM cell and changing it's state. You will never be able to reproduce this hard x-ray which made it's way thru the atmosphere without interaction hitting exactly the right \xb5m\xb3 to do the same bit-flip again. You can just have redundancy in information and processing (ECC, parity, lock-step etc.) to have enough probability to detect (and reset) or correct the fault.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Faults, no matter if systematic or random can be single, multiple, latent and dependent faults.
  <br/>
  Single fault: a single error leads to a hazardous state
  <br/>
  Multiple point fault: more than one (independent) error will lead to a hazardous state
  <br/>
  Latent fault: a fault which remains undetected for some time (e.g. only detectable during startup / power-on) and not hazardous by itself. But together with a second fault it will lead to a hazardous event. But the probability of 2 errors within a power cycle is sufficiently low.
  <br/>
  Dependent fault: A fault, by itself not hazardous which will influence the probability of a second fault with both in combination... exactly. (-&gt; freedom from interference not given)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Having the same SW bug on both engines would fall within the dependent fault category. Redundancy only helps if freedom from interference is given.
  <br/>
  So if there is a fault in SW and both FADEC instances get the same input and have the same timing, they will react the same way. If there is a hidden systematic fault, both will show it. This is why things are often programmed twice by independent teams or on different processors. They will not do the exact same mistake. Or there is a normal function and a supervisor like TCMA. One complex function but a tiny, easy to analyze supervisor just checking for the hazardous state.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All this can be analyzed and is really lots of work but necessary. So first there is an analysis how severe a fault would be on a high level, this defines the necessary level of analysis in detail.

     Just in case it wasn't obvious, JustusW managed to make an excellent point twice in their post about FPGA's, software and bugs.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The above code has a bug, which I assume was deliberate in order to see how many of us were really reading what they had to say, and to drive that home. Well done you, it is a simple illustration of just how easy it is for issues to slip through and not be noticed.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     While this simple bug would have been picked up early on by a compiler there could well be other much more esoteric and subtle bugs that could take years in operation and require a very specific set of circumstances before they trip. I make no comment or assertion that's the case here for AI 171, but it is worth bearing in mind in any search for understanding and cause.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     FP.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Mmm. Yes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To be clear, this is 'happily' executed in
  <i>
   perl
  </i>
  , and doesn't give the results you might expect.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  if ( happy == false ) {
  <br/>
  print("I'm happy!")
  <br/>
  }
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A FADEC might faithfully implement the logic of the design, Someone might even have spent a lot of resources to
  <i>
   formally prov
  </i>
  e that the FADEC logic implements the specification. The trouble is, that does not tell you that the specification is
  <i>
   correct
  </i>
  .
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Additionally, even if the specification is correct, it is possible to be implementing the code on flawed hardware.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is
  <i>
   not impossible
  </i>
  that a common set of inputs* triggered an unusual FADEC response in separate FADECs: however, not impossible does not mean that it is
  <i>
   likely
  </i>
  .
  <br/>
  <br/>
  *For example, the FADEC could be programmed to expect an input value to be a positive integer e.g. for altitude. If the device that sends the altitude value to the FADEC sends a negative value, one of several things might happen: (1) it could be rejected as being out of range. (2) It could be replaced with the lowest possible positive value: +0 (3) It could interpret the signed integer it has been given as an unsigned integer and treat it as an unrealistically large positive value.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I am
  <i>
   not
  </i>
  saying this is what has happened. Getting disagreement in the format of values sent between differing systems is not an unknown problem. Software problems as a result of poor, or differing interpretations of specifications have hit many high-profile projects: such as the
  <a href="https://sma.nasa.gov/news/safety-messages/safety-message-item/lost-in-translation" target="_blank">
   Mars Climate Orbiter
  </a>
  and the
  <a href="http://file:///home/pgrb/Downloads/safetymessage-2006-02-01-ariane5-vits.pdf" target="_blank">
   Ariane 5
  </a>
  - so I will not say that a system that includes FADECs cannot have problems: rather, that problems are
  <i>
   unlikely
  </i>
  .

     That\x92s the nature of a common mode bug. If the software was vulnerable to Mars being in the house of Uranus, the scent of lilacs and the DOW being less than 42,000 then you\x92d expect the failure to occur everywhere when these conjoined. Same when an aeroplane\x92s systems and/or the environment present data that triggers an unplanned/unforeseen response in something like an EEC/FADEC. The experts still appear to think that this is unlikely but we have been presented with an unlikely occurrence...
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I have to both agree and disagree with both this and the next post by TryingToLearn.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yes, there may be (let's assume is) "identical" FADEC/TCMA hardware and firmware on both engines, but if the Left Engine is subject to Mars in the house of Uranus (wink wink), then the Right Engine cannot be, maybe it's Venus in the same House. This is simply because the Left engine TCMA 'contraption', I'm going to call it, is monitoring Left Engine Conditions (Shaft Speed, T/L setting / position data - Right or Wrong, and calculating and comparing accordingly against its internal map) while the opposite TCMA "device" is monitoring and calculating etc, Right Engine Conditions. There are some things in common, but (I say) it's virtually impossible for the Engine Conditions being individually monitored to be identical in both engines.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Thrust Levers are electro-mechanical devices, almost certainly at this stage pushed by a somewhat squishy human hand, likely with a slight offset. What is the probability that those two levers are in identical positions, and even if they are, that the calibration (e.g. "zero points") of both levers are identical, and that the values they output (response slopes/curves) are exactly matching in every matching point in their individual travels? That's just one aspect, but consider the engines. They are different ages. Have different amounts of wear. They have separate fuel metering valves (or other names), separate HP Fuel pumps (and, I guess relief valves?), all also subject to wear), and each has a host of other, correspondingly paired, sensors, (maybe of different makes and certainly of different ages and different calibrations and response curves) from which each FADEC, supposedly independently of the TCMA, adjusts the fuel metering device settings and resulting engine power, and shaft RPMs follow in some other slightly non-matching way.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sure, I would completely agree that the two engines and their calculated Throttle Lever positions to Shaft RPMs are always going to be similar during normal, matched operation, and they will very likely dance with each other, maybe one 'always' (75% of the time, say) leading during one dance (TO, say) with the other leading in dancing to a different tune (descent, say).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To me, the fact that this appears to have been an almost simultaneous dual engine failure, pretty much, for me, rules out a FADEC/TCMA firmware bug, especially as there don't seem to be any reports of even a single engine mid-air TCMA shutdown.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  HOWEVER, and I want to stress this, that doesn't rule out the possibility that both TCMAs shutdown their respective engines simultaneously. Any lack of simultaneity observed would be due to those slight differences in other pieces of hardware, such as the time for one Shutoff valve to close versus the other.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As far as I know, there isn't enough information on what's actually inside those TCMA Black Boxes to say anything for sure, but here's a thought, which I think has been alluded to, or the question asked, here in one or other thread, earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  What does the TCMA firmware do when an engine is already running at a high power setting and TWO things occur in quick succession?  I suspect this kind of event is a highly probable cause, but these two events have not occurred close enough together, or ever, before.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Imagine this: Plane taking off, Throttle Levers near Full Power, Engines performing correctly, also near Full Power, Rotation etc all normal, plane beginning to climb, positive rate achieved.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pilot calls GEARUP. GearUp, activated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Gear Retract sequence begins. Due to some unforeseen or freshly occurring (maybe intermittent short or open circuit) linkage between the gear Up sequence and the WOW or Air/Ground System, the signal to both TCMAs suddenly switches to GROUND. All "good", so far, as the engine RPMs match the Throttle Lever settings and TCMA doesn't flinch. The plane could be in a Valid Takeoff sequence, so it had better not!  But it does make a bit of sense. How is WOW / Air/Ground detected? Somewhere near the Landing Gear, I assume.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  HOWEVER, now, a moment later, and perhaps due to a related system response, the Thrust Levers suddenly get pulled back to Idle, whether by man or Machine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  What would you expect the TCMA system to do? I would guess, fairly soon thereafter, two, independent, Fuel Cutoffs... Though I fully admit, I'm guessing based on a severe lack of knowledge of that Firmware.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ok, no need for further explanation on that point, but I did refer to TCMA unflatteringly as a contraption, earlier. Last night (regrettably, before bed) I started looking at the TCMA Google Patent. Let's just say, so far, I'm aghast! My first impressions are bad ones. How did this patent even get approved?  What I suspect here, now, is not a Firmware bug, but a serious Logic and Program Defect. But we'd have to see what's inside the firmware.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When I get more time, I'll dig deeper.

  , I think this has been covered, especially re the engines, in some depth already. Several who post here have extensive knowledge in FADEC and associated protections. It's all a mystery tbh and I guess we just need to wait now until some concrete evidence is produced by the AAIB.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Not wishing to dampen enthusiasm to find out a cause but, 2 Threads in, no-one is much the wiser. Just my opinion but that seems to be where we are. What a dreadful accident - I can't even begin to imagine what the crew went through in those final moments.
