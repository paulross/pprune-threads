  I guess I\x92m hoping that there is (and trying to find) a logical explanation to this accident that we can all learn from and make sure it never happens again. There aren\x92t that many things that scare me in my job. Some of the alternatives I find terrifying for the industry, the manufacturer, the operators and the travelling public.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  PPRUNE could make a rule that all accident threads are locked until the final report is published when it can be discussed (I\x92m sure the mods have been tempted at times)! I suspect the website wouldn\x92t get many hits if it did\x85..

  The fire switches potentially provide that capability.

  <br/>
  There are many types where the shutoff position is a fully aft thrust lever, past a lift-up gate. Apparently this has caused a few human-factors issues because other types use the exact same mechanism for setting reverse thrust.

     One thing that I remember from when I was a simulator TRI/TRE on a Boeing was that as an instructor you get very used to operating critical
     <br/>
     switches rapidly without following any procedure, in order to set the sim up for a single engine landing etc. When I was then line flying next I had to guard against doing the same thing in the real aircraft.
    </div>

  Muscle memory is a strange and (usually) wonderous thing.  It allows us as humans to perform amazing things without actually thinking about what we are doing.  Professional Athletes have perfected this to a high art, but the rest of us do things using muscle memory on a regular basis.  Back when I was still racing, I happened to look down at my hands on the steering wheel in fast, bumpy corner, and I was simply amazed at the large, rapid steering inputs that I was making to compensate for the bumps - with absolutely zero conscious thought. Muscle memory at its best.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, it can also bite us.  The Delta dual engine shutdown during takeoff from LA (referenced way back when in the 1st accident thread) was caused by muscle memory - the pilot reached down to set the EEC switches (located near the fuel On-Off switches) but muscle memory caused him to do something else - set both fuel switches to OFF.  Fortunately, he quickly recognized his error, placing the switches back to RUN and the engines recovered in time to prevent a water landing (barely).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is conceivable that a pilot - reaching down to the center console to adjust something unrelated - could have muscle memory cause him to turn the fuel off to both engines.  While all new engines are tested for "Quick Windmill Relight" - i.e. the fuel switch is set to CUTOFF with the engine at high power - and the engine must recover and produce thrust withing a specified time (memory says 60 or 90 seconds) - it takes a finite amount of time for the engines to recover (spool down after a power cut at high power is incredibly fast - plus moving the switch to CUTOFF causes a FADEC reset, which means it won't do anything for ~ 1 second).  Doing that at a couple hundred feet and the chance that an engine will recover and start producing thrust before ground impact is pretty much zero

     Theory alert : If you don\x92t have, or delete the cruise altitude in the FMC the aircraft will command a level off at 400ft, with the thrust levers reducing thrust significantly (I\x92ve seen it in the sim and happened at least once for real to my operator). It\x92s easy to do when loading the descent winds if you hit the wrong button. Could this have been confused with a loss of thrust?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     And I would say the cut off switches do make a fairly unique click when being moved - I can hear it in my head as I write this!
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I asked because if the FDR indicates that the switches were pulled, but there's no sound on the CVR, that might be giving them pause.

  A bit of a pedantic point, but the locking lever in the photo above is not the right action for the fuel cut off switches on the 787.

  It would be a lot more conceivable if the pilot had been practicing this action in a simulator recently.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's ironic that cognitive science arguably started with 'The Cambridge Cockpit'; an attempt to make sense of, and mitigate, pilots doing this sort of thing when tired, stressed and so on.  This kick started an ergonomics revolution which appears to have come full circle.  Now we have cognitive science offering Bayesian accounts of neural function that might explain how innocent but unfortunate priming of 'muscle memory' when practicing for emergencies could, almost predictably, lead to this sort of complex, protection overriding, error.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As non consciously executing a complex, well practiced, but unintended, action is a fairly common experience in less critical situations, I'm surprised that there isn't already a more effective ergonomic fix than the safety switches fitted.

   : if that were actually the scenario, would they not instead be focusing on why "for some extraordinary reason [they were] confronted with both engines out on lift off", rather than having "narrowed its focus to the movement of the plane's fuel control switches", which would just be a side effect not a root cause?

     There has been discussion recently about a procedure that involves moving the fuel switches to CUTOFF and then back to RUN following a dual engine failure.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Attached is an image of a page from the Air India 787 Training Manual that discusses this procedure.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I am submitting this without comment or opinion.

  Nobody seems to have discussed this.  If I'm reading it right (and I'm not a pilot), it seems to be suggesting that in the event of a dual engine failure, a restart should be attempted while the engine still has high RPM?  It also seems to be indicating that fuel switch resetting should be attempted if the restart has failed to start the engine?

     As a 787 operator I can observe a couple of things......
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Deliberately cycling the Engine Cutoff switches just after rotate, in response to a dual power loss is inconceivable. You are way too low and slow for it to have any effect and your attention is better devoted to aiming for the flattest area ahead to crash into. Commencing the Dual Eng Fail/Stall checklist memory items is conditional upon both engines being at sub-idle and the aircraft being within the in-flight relight envelope. Neither of those conditions existed.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Given your professional view above, how do you react to the posted Air India 787 manual suggesting that dual engine relight should be attempted at any altitude?

  <br/>
  <br/>
  Obviously, because it's going to require quick action to catch high RPM. And maybe that's what they tried.

  Not sure about this. I think it's saying Resetting to initiate a Restart attempt. Not repeating it.

  I don't have any comment on it other than to note that the manual is not specific to Air India. My B787-9 FCTM is identical as far as I can tell. The actual memory item for dual failure is to reset the fuel switches and start the RAT. It is also conditional on the engines being sub idle as noted by the other poster.

  Excellent, thank you. More and more I'm convinced, as I was at Day One, that this guy* was a genuinely excellent pilot. More sad than ever.

     It is not inconceivable to me that a human being who THINKS they've had a dual engine failure at possibly the worst time imaginable (correctly or incorrectly) and has not taken the time to confirm, or take it all in and has immediately launched into memory items. I could certainly foresee one being rather startled by the energy state and the rapidly approaching buildings.
     <br/>
     I'm not saying that this happened to this crew but it certainly could happen to someone. People do weird !!!! under high stress. There is an initial "oh !!!!, what's going on" then the training kicks in. Often at super fast rate and the challenge becomes slowing it all down.
     <br/>
     The bloody master warning on the Airbus for smoke in the forward Lav used to get me everytime. Was always at night over the ocean too.

  It\x92s also not inconceivable that a human being who KNOWS they\x92ve had a dual engine failure at the worst time has immediately launched into memory items. Those memory items include \x91cycling\x92 the fuel cut off switches\x85

  A couple of points if I may......
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I don't see it written in the 787 FCOM but I have always been told that the action of resetting the Engine Cutoff switches in the event of a dual engine failure, is merely backing up what the FADECs have already done.  If there is an 'engine event' the FADECs will manage ignition and fuel-flow to restore the thrust that was demanded before the event.  If that management has failed then the manual resetting may be more successful.  (The same holds true for the RAT, manual selection is merely backing up the auto-deployment).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Any airline pilot will tell you that executing an in-flight relight on a big engine, no matter if it is by electric start, windmilling RPM or cross-bleed assisted, can take between 1 and 3 minutes to restore power.  This aircraft was airborne for less that 30 seconds.  No pilot in his right mind would prioritise an in-flight relight procedure, in a situation where they had neither the time, the height nor the speed for it to succeed.  I have no doubt the crew focussed entirely on pointing the aircraft at the clearest area they could see, to mitigate what would inevitably follow.

  Yes, and of course if selecting the cut off switches was a result of both engines shutting down would the FDRs be able to register switch movement after, one assumes, all electrical power has been lost.
  <br/>
  Anyway, the other thread is open at the moment, maybe this should be moved there.

  The data recorder has all the information most are questioning. They already know if the fuel control switches were selected to cutoff and they know if this happened before or after the loss of thrust. Perhaps the sequence of events will be more clear tomorrow. I can tell you that from aircraft rotation to loss of thrust was a very short time period. Perhaps 8 seconds. I simply won&rsquo;t believe in that time period the crew were taking any non deliberate actions that would have shut the motors down.
