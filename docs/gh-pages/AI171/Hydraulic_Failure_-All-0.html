     Given the sound which clearly mimics the RAT, images and collective tech knowledge, what could lead to this symmetric loss of thrust/lift at 200ft?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Fuel supply/quality issues?

  Gear unable to be retracted and flaps retracted due to no hydraulic pressure? It would certainly explain the RAT being deployed and the loss of lift.

     You are saying the RAT is deployed but we can rule out engine failure?

  Of course the RAT will deploy if all three hydraulic systems have low pressure even with both engines running. This is the case on the 77/78.

     And your post squarly falls within the categories you describe in your first paragraph. I have, and still am flying 757/767s, flown probably around 40 examples from early to late production planes AND EVERY SINGLE ONE had a RAT.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  You are quite correct. Every wide body Boeing (and Airbus) twin plus the 747-8 has a RAT - Some drive a generator and/or some drive a hydraulic pump. The reason for the 748 having a RAT is that for a 3 or more engine flameout (Boeing speak for a 4 engine flameout) the EDP&rsquo;s are depressurised to unload the gearbox for ease of windmilling. Hence, no engines = no hydraulics. Edited to clarify the different reasons for the RAT. Edited to add every &ldquo;wide body&rdquo;

  There isn't enough clarity on numerous issues, and without answers to the following, zero conclusions can be made as to a possible cause. This is definitely one that could go in numerous directions. Anyone claiming to have the definitive answers must have the FDR data, and I'm assuming that shouldn't take too long to be located and analysed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  1a. Were flaps deployed at start of take off roll?
  <br/>
  1b. Were flaps retracted coinciding with climb rate reduction?
  <br/>
  2. Did the RAT definitely deploy? The videos are grainy low quality. AI improvement surely isn't reliable.
  <br/>
  3. If the RAT deployed, would that indicate complete power loss?
  <br/>
  4. Was there any other audio indicating thrust loss or variations during departure?
  <br/>
  5. Can we confirm the pilot Mayday indicating thrust loss? If so, that needs investigation as a first priority. The pilot was telling us the cause. Unless we have alternative information he should be believed.
  <br/>
  6. Why was the gear not retracted? Distraction, hydraulic failure, flap instead of gear, intentionally, the possibilities are endless.
  <br/>
  7. If complete thrust loss occurred, other than a severe fuel issue, what could cause simultaneous flameout? That would be almost unimaginable, yet this is what the pilot allergy said happened. It would have massive ramifications if that gets confirmed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I don't think the video clips we have are clear enough to say anything at all at this stage. Flaps are hard to see on 787 imo for departure settings. All I can say is it appeared to climb well in the first seconds, then coinciding with the point that gear would usually be retracted, lift appears to very quickly be lost. That indicates sudden speed loss, or lift loss. Speed loss would be thrust, lift loss would be flap retraction if thrust was still available.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pilot allegedly reported thrust loss, that should be highest on the list of causes imo. In the case of double engine failure without any apparent outside influence visible on videos, that would be quite something for investigators to fathom.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I don't know if anyone has data to show speed trend at the point the aircraft starts to descend, or a better audio for thrust variations at that point. I'm guessing that the update frequency on FR24 would be too slow to show that sudden change at the highest point achieved.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  We'll have the answers soon enough, all I can say is there appears to be no clear answers here without the data recorders or clear improved information. Indeed no conclusions whatsoever can be made as to crew actions either.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  RIP crew and passengers, condolences to the families.

  Any autothrust discussion is misleading since every pilot in that situation will firewall the levers whatever thrust reduction was selected for TO . the same is true for the RAT discussion- if enough hydraulic pressure was generated or not . The plane pitched up last second so there obviously was control until the end . Of course , without energy pulling alone will not bring you anywhere .

     Still no one talking about the landing gear position?
     <br/>
     A 787-8 with the landing gear down should have the bogey tilting upwards. Clearly in the video, the bogey is tilting downwards, which would indicate something on the aircraft is not working 100% as it should.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Although the gear bogie isn\x92t in the initial post-liftoff position, if you can see the retraction mechanism operating in a 787 It first tilts the bogie forward. I\x92d therefore consider that a \x93gear up\x94 switch was activated but the action failed \x97most likely due to hydraulic pressure loss. In the second video (left-side view), I could interpret that gear retraction begins around 24 s and then halts before 27 s, exactly when the aircraft stops climbing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Just my two cents, from the perspective of an aircraft engineer with a background primarily in Airbus.&ZeroWidthSpace;&ZeroWidthSpace;

  Let\x92s be careful about absolutes. Emirates 521 and Turkish 1951 are both examples of crews not firewalling the thrust levers despite low energy. The late pitch up could be due to the onset of a stall not an order from the crew.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  TCMA is function which can reduce thrust on both engines simultaneously. It had done so in error in the past resulting in an AD. It uses air/ground logic so that it only operates on the ground, however note that at the point of thrust loss the gear is still down without any movement of the gear or doors. I would expect gear retraction to start before that height. Could we imagine an air/ground logic fault inhibiting gear retraction and allowing TCMA, which triggered (for whatever reason!) causing dual thrust loss? I would expect this to be in the realms of a combination of failures shown to be extremely impossible, but\x85

  The gear is required to be retracted within 12 seconds even on one engine. The fact that it wasn't means it was either not selected or there wasn't engine driven hydraulic pressure to do it.
  <br/>
  Out of interest about when did the RAT include a hydraulic pump, not that it would be sufficient to retract the gear anyway.

     Although the gear bogie isn\x92t in the initial post-liftoff position, if you can see the retraction mechanism operating in a 787 It first tilts the bogie forward. I\x92d therefore consider that a \x93gear up\x94 switch was activated but the action failed \x97most likely due to hydraulic pressure loss. In the second video (left-side view), I could interpret that gear retraction begins around 24 s and then halts before 27 s, exactly when the aircraft stops climbing.

     <br/>
     Just my two cents, from the perspective of an aircraft engineer with a background primarily in Airbus.&ZeroWidthSpace;&ZeroWidthSpace;

  Thank you, and to HI288 too! this combined with the FR24 blog post about adsb loss just over the runway threshold, and the latest DGCA ask for Air India 787 maintenance adds more weight to the theory, IMO, that there was a major technical issue in play here.

     The gear is required to be retracted within 12 seconds even on one engine. The fact that it wasn't means it was either not selected or there wasn't engine driven hydraulic pressure to do it.
     <br/>
     Out of interest about when did the RAT include a hydraulic pump, not that it would be sufficient to retract the gear anyway.

  </div>
  Gear is actuated from Centre system hydraulics which is pressurised by two AC electric pumps not the engines.

     Question is why both engines lost power . Foreign object ingestion , contaminated fuel or both cutoff levels operated ? We do not know .
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Any autothrust discussion is misleading since every pilot in that situation will firewall the levers whatever thrust reduction was selected for TO . the same is true for the RAT discussion- if enough hydraulic pressure was generated or not . The plane pitched up last second so there obviously was control until the end . Of course , without energy pulling alone will not bring you anywhere .
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Why did both engines fail the same second as they would be cut off ???

  Actually not true. Remember the 737 with iced up itt probes that hit the Washington bridge?

  a simple \x93yugga\x94 on the power levers would have prevented disaster.

  probably irrelevant to this topic however

  Speaking as a B787 Captain..... There is so much rubbish and stupid suggestion being written here.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This aircraft was airborne for a grand total of 22 seconds, half of which was climbing to no more than 150' aal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - No Flaps? Due to the setup of the ECL it is physically impossible to go down the runway without some sort of take-off flap set. The T/o config warning would have been singing it's head off. Despite assertions to the contrary I have seen no video clear enough to detect a lack of flaps.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - RAT out? Almost impossible, I have seen no quality footage that definitively witnesses the RAT being out. Those who think they car hear a RAT type noise might be listening to a motorcycle passing or similar. It takes a triple hydraulic failure or a double engine failure to trigger RAT deploment. They happily went through V1 without a hint of rejected take off so as they rotated the aircraft was serviceable. These are big engines, they take a long time to wind down when you shut them down. I have never tried it however engine failure detection takes 30s or for the aircraft to react and they were not even airborne that long.
  <br/>
  - Flaps up instead of gear? The B787 flaps are slow both in and out. Given that the 'Positive rate' call is not made the second the wheels leave the ground, a mis-selection of flaps up would not cause any loss of lift for at least 20 seconds, by which time they had already crashed. I believe the gear remained down not because of mis-selection but because of a major distraction on rotate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Discounting the impossible, two hypotheses remain:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  1. Invalid derate set through incorrect cross-checking. Trundling down the runway takes very little power to reach Vr. It is only when you rotate that you create more drag and discover that you do not have sufficient thrust vs. drag to sustain a climb. Or....
  <br/>
  2. Put 200' as the altitude target in the FCU. Immediate ALT capture and all the power comes off. PF is still hand flying trying to increase pitch but is already way behind the aircraft.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It could be after this that Boeing are forced to review the B787 practice of exploring the very edges of the performance envelope.

  How would 'all the power come off' at 150ft AAL when the Autothrottle would still be in HOLD mode (until 400ft) and therefore be unable to move?

     I've been closely examining a video frame captured very early in the footage depicting the aircraft's final moments. In this particular frame, I believe the
     <b>
      left main landing gear (MLG) door is clearly visible in the open position
     </b>
     , while the
     <b>
      right MLG door appears closed
     </b>
     . Additionally, both
     <b>
      main gear bogies are noticeably tilted forward
     </b>
     \x97 a configuration that typically occurs at the initiation of the gear retraction sequence.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     This combination strongly suggests that a
     <b>
      gear retraction was commanded
     </b>
     , but the
     <b>
      sequence was interrupted and never completed
     </b>
     . What\x92s particularly striking is the
     <b>
      asymmetry
     </b>
     \x97 the left door open, the right door closed \x97 which should not occur during normal operations and points toward a possible
     <b>
      hydraulic failure scenario
     </b>
     during retraction.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     As many will know, on the Boeing 787-8,
     <b>
      each main gear door is hydraulically actuated and powered by its respective side\x92s hydraulic system
     </b>
     \x97 the
     <b>
      left gear door by the left hydraulic system
     </b>
     , and the
     <b>
      right by the right
     </b>
     . This leads me to propose the following hypothesis:
     <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
      <li>
       Shortly after rotation, with a positive rate of climb established, the
       <b>
        flight crew commands gear up
       </b>
       .
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       The
       <b>
        gear retraction sequence initiates
       </b>
       ; the
       <b>
        main gear bogies tilt forward
       </b>
       , consistent with the start of retraction.
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       <b>
        The right engine fails first
       </b>
       , resulting in a
       <b>
        loss of right hydraulic system pressure
       </b>
       . Consequently, the
       <b>
        right MLG door does not open
       </b>
       .
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       The
       <b>
        left MLG door, still powered by the left hydraulic system, opens
       </b>
       .
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       <b>
        Moments later, the left engine also fails
       </b>
       , leading to
       <b>
        loss of the left hydraulic system
       </b>
       . With the door now open but no remaining hydraulic pressure,
       <b>
        the left main gear remains extended and the door remains open
       </b>
       .
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       The
       <b>
        ram air turbine (RAT) deploys
       </b>
       , consistent with total engine and electrical power loss.
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       With the
       <b>
        loss of thrust from both engines
       </b>
       , the aircraft loses lift and enters an unrecoverable descent, tragically ending in impact.
       <br/>
      </li>
     </ol>
     This sequence would explain the
     <b>
      partially completed gear retraction
     </b>
     and the
     <b>
      asymmetric gear door position
     </b>
     observed in the video evidence. It\x92s worth noting that the timing of the hydraulic losses would have to be
     <b>
      very close together
     </b>
     \x97 potentially within seconds \x97 which aligns with a
     <b>
      dual engine failure shortly after take-off
     </b>
     . In such a scenario,
     <b>
      asymmetric thrust would be minimal or non-existent
     </b>
     , making the aircraft\x92s attitude appear otherwise stable in its descent.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Further supporting this theory are:
     <ul>
      <li>
       <b>
        Eyewitness reports of a loud bang
       </b>
       , possibly indicating an engine failure.
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       A
       <b>
        mayday call
       </b>
       reportedly made by the crew.
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       The
       <b>
        audible presence of the RAT
       </b>
       in the video, suggesting a complete loss of engine-driven electrical and hydraulic systems.
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       The
       <b>
        noticeable absence of typical engine noise
       </b>
       , supporting the hypothesis of dual engine failure.
       <br/>
      </li>
     </ul>
     This scenario would offer a tragically plausible explanation for the aircraft\x92s behavior and the observed configuration in its final moments. Of course, the
     <b>
      official investigation will provide the definitive answers
     </b>
     , and we must await their findings.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     In the meantime, my thoughts are very much with all those affected by this heartbreaking event.
     <br/>
     <br/>

     <b>
      NOTE:
     </b>
     Unfortunately this is my first post here. I wanted to upload the frame for all to see but the forum is restricting me from doing this until I reach 8 posts. I can't link to it via a URL either. I studied a frame from the very start of the video, just as the full aircraft enters view and expanded it by 400% allowing me to see the position of the MLG doors).
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I have no knowledge about 787, but every landing gear system I\x92ve worked with did not sequence Left and Right MLG to retract and extend with each other. In fact it is typical for left and right side to move at slightly different speed due to different friction etc. Retraction assymmetry is probably not a clue to this mystery.

  No argument on the flaps.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The engines, however: yes they take a long time to wind down
  <i>
   fully
  </i>
  , but they don't take long to stop providing thrust if you shut them down or cut the fuel (or indeed have a bird strike). I don't understand why you consider a loss of thrust to be an impossible hypothesis.

  There's also a still image above which appears to show a deployed RAT; that's even if we discount the sound track, which might indeed be something else than a RAT, and ignore the sound of the crash being clearly audible despite the lack of engine noise earlier in the video.

     Speaking as a B787 Captain..... There is so much rubbish and stupid suggestion being written here.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     This aircraft was airborne for a grand total of 22 seconds, half of which was climbing to no more than 150' aal.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     - No Flaps? Due to the setup of the ECL it is physically impossible to go down the runway without some sort of take-off flap set. The T/o config warning would have been singing it's head off. Despite assertions to the contrary I have seen no video clear enough to detect a lack of flaps.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     - RAT out? Almost impossible, I have seen no quality footage that definitively witnesses the RAT being out. Those who think they car hear a RAT type noise might be listening to a motorcycle passing or similar. It takes a triple hydraulic failure or a double engine failure to trigger RAT deploment. They happily went through V1 without a hint of rejected take off so as they rotated the aircraft was serviceable. These are big engines, they take a long time to wind down when you shut them down. I have never tried it however engine failure detection takes 30s or for the aircraft to react and they were not even airborne that long.
     <br/>
     - Flaps up instead of gear? The B787 flaps are slow both in and out. Given that the 'Positive rate' call is not made the second the wheels leave the ground, a mis-selection of flaps up would not cause any loss of lift for at least 20 seconds, by which time they had already crashed. I believe the gear remained down not because of mis-selection but because of a major distraction on rotate.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Discounting the impossible, two hypotheses remain:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     1. Invalid derate set through incorrect cross-checking. Trundling down the runway takes very little power to reach Vr. It is only when you rotate that you create more drag and discover that you do not have sufficient thrust vs. drag to sustain a climb. Or....
     <br/>
     2. Put 200' as the altitude target in the FCU. Immediate ALT capture and all the power comes off. PF is still hand flying trying to increase pitch but is already way behind the aircraft.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     It could be after this that Boeing are forced to review the B787 practice of exploring the very edges of the performance envelope.

  I have to agree with everything here except your assertion about engine shutdown.
  <br/>
  Even though these are big engines with plenty of inertia, when you select engine shut off they spool down very quickly if on load. IE, The generators, two per engine and hydraulic pumps, etc, being driven by the (relatively) small mass of the N2 rotor will drag the speed down very quickly, the gennies will trip offine in seconds, the pumps will quickly reduce flow and pressure.
  <br/>
  As for what went wrong.
  <br/>
  If the engines have stopped working there has to be a common failure mode, fuel is one but as has been said, no other aircraft has had a problem, as far as we know. FOD? It would have to be something major to shut down two GeNX engines and there would be debris all over the runway, we would know by now.
  <br/>
  I have no idea if the RAT has deployed, I can't see it in the video and the noise could be something else.
  <br/>
  We shall see.
  <br/>
  There is compelling evidence that flaps are set correctly and not retracted inadvertently.
  <br/>
  I await further evidence.
  <br/>
  Edit to add. LAE 40 years, type rated on 737 to 787 with lots of others in between.
