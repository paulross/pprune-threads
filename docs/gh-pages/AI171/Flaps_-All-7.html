     A mate tried gear/flap scenario in the sim earlier. Selecting flaps up (all the way) instead of the gear did not predjudice the flight path at all. They selected flaps up at normal gear retraction height and punched the AP in. The Slats remained out until 225kts (as per my post about 50 pages ago) and the aircraft climbed happily away clearing all obstacle by a good margin.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  can you ask him by any chance what the outcome would be with f15 or 20 speeds, but in a F5 config and a rotation at VrF15 ?
  <br/>
  and retract the flaps to 1 instead of gear ?
  <br/>
  sorry I don\x92t know if that has been tested already.

     . It is amazing that people are still arguing about the height the aircraft reached during the first 11s of the flight. It is almost measurable to the metre from the aircraft wingspan on the video. Do not mistake the power required to reach Vr within in the TORA with the power required to maintain a stable climb at V2 to V2+10 in the second and third segments. They are very different numbers, that's why Perf A is one of the dark arts of aviation! It is quite probable that this aircraft rotated below a suitable Vr speed for the weight and ambient conditions and was unable to establish a stable climb due lack of applied power. Big engines take time to spool up, your immediate future depends on how late you recognise the situation and go for TOGA.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     But you ask..... How can an aircraft possibly get airborne with a stalled wing? Look at
     <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%A9gional_Flight_7775" target="_blank">
      Air France 7775
     </a>
     . At rotate the wing was already stalled (albeit for different reasons) but the airborne profile of the aircraft was rather similar to Air India.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  The rotation in the video appears normal and tail clearance is normal as well. That suggests VR was correct as well as the flap setting.

  What I cannot do is add new theories or uncover any new facts the actual experts have not already thought of. However, since summarizing and structuring information is one thing lawyers tend to regularly do (and sometimes even do well), here is my attempt at a useful contribution to this thread: an attempt to summarize the main theories discussed here since day one (which I think hasn't been done for quite some time) in the hope that a birds-eye view will be helpful to those who have not read everything since the beginning or might even trigger some new flash of inspiration for someone more knowledgable than me. I have focused on the cons since there does not seem to be enough evidence to come to any positive conclusion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I shall try to be concise and to refrain from personal evaluations of my own. Of course, no disrespect whatsoever is intended towards all those who have contributed to this thread and to the individual theories, one or combinations of which may turn out to have led to this tragic outcome. That arguments can be made against every single theory that has been propagated seems to be the result of the highly improbable and unusual nature of this deplorable event and certainly not due to any lack of knowledge or reasoning skills in this forum.

   Widely refuted, since
  </span>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <span style="color:black">
     rotation, takeoff and initial climb seem normal;
    </span>
   </li>
   <li>
    likely extreme errors would have been required to have such tragic effect (the fuel tanks should have been only about half full, so not close to MTOW);
   </li>
   <li>
    there is strong evidence that at least some flaps were extended for takeoff (post-crash photo, perhaps also visible in video from behind)

     B. Flaps retracted post-takeoff instead of gear
    </span>
   </u>
  </b>
  <br/>
  <span style="color:black">
   Still brought up from time to time. However, widely disregarded due to
  </span>
  <ul>
   <li>
    the fact that with two working engines an inadvertent flap retraction should easily be recoverable, even with gear down;
   </li>
   <li>
    strong indications that hydraulic and electric power were lost (audible/visible indications of RAT extension, survivor statement, lack of engine noise, position of MLG bogies).
   </li>
  </ul>
  <span style="color:black">
   For a while, the forward tilt of the bogies as first part of the retraction cycle was seen as additional evidence that the gear had been selected up. However, it has been pointed out that the forward tilt and the opening of the gear doors occur almost simultaneously so that it seems unlikely that hydraulic power was lost in the split second between bogie tilt and gear door actuation. It is now assumed the forward tilt of the bogies was merely a consequence of the hydraulic power loss.
  </span>
  <br/>
  <span style="color:black">
   It should be pointed out that the question of "RAT in or out" was for a while the most contentious in this thread.

  <ul>
   <li>
    inconsistent with apparent loss of hydraulic/electric power;
   </li>
   <li>
    PF would have been flying manually (however, A/T reaction would have been unexpected for the PF);
   </li>
   <li>
    should have been recoverable (unless one assumes that the crew (a) remained unaware of the changed FMA annunciations although alerted by the unexpected FD commands; and (b) was so startled that an A/T thrust reduction was not noticed and corrected, even though the PF was apparently sufficiently alert not to follow the FD commands).

     Can someone help me with the calculations on how far from the point of our last ADS-B readout we can expect the stricken jet to fly/glide?
     <br/>
     I am assuming the take off mass around 190-200 tons with 50 tons of fuel. For the glide phase this is of no importance, however.
     <br/>
     Data on the Internet puts the glide ratio of a 789 around 18-21:1. Gear and flaps/slats out should have a significant negative effect. Does anyone have a good take how much? Minus 40%?
     <br/>
     From the available data we can infer the plane never was higher than 200\x92 AAL, maybe even 100\x92. If I understood the online sources correctly, the point of impact was only about 20\x92 lower than the average runway level.
     <br/>
     If I am not mistaken the distance from the last ADS-B point to the impact site is about 2 km as per Reuters and the Guardian. That would put it at 6,500\x92.
     <br/>
     I just can\x92t get these numbers over each other without the aircraft producing thrust. Please help me correcting the numbers.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  In prior posts, I used approximately the same numbers and came to a similar conclusion (we can't rule out the possibility that there was a least idle thrust available after the loss of thrust), using a guess of a 44% reduction for the configuration from a max L/D of 21. Starting with the height and distance being approximate however, we also don't know what the airspeed/angle of attack was at any point in the descent versus the speed for the maximum (and unknown) L/D for the gear and flaps extended and the RAT out, the amount of  headwind, the increase in L/D in ground effect (at a height less than the wingspan) over other than a smooth surface, thermal activity in a urban area, the distance gained in the flare at the end, etc.

     In the CSV data set that can be downloaded from that link the first point with altitude data is 1630 ft short of the departure threshold. That point is 575. The highest alt recorded in the data set is 625. All the points with altitude data overlay the departure runway. I do not understand how anyone is using this data set to determine the maximum altitude which was way past the departure end.

  I posted my first-cut analysis in the earlier thread.
  <br/>
  I've had a bit more time to analyse now.
  <br/>
  Those ADS-B data points (and particularly the rate of deceleration) are EXACTLY what you would expect to see from a total engine failure at or very shortly after TAKE-OFF
  <br/>
  (it implies a 13:1 L/D which must be pretty close for gear down and flaps 5).
  <br/>
  It places takeoff at 700m before the runway end @ ~185kt
  <br/>
  Based on those, max altitude was c250ft @ 140kt (or the equivalent total energy equivalent), 500m after the end of the runway.
  <br/>
  13:1 L/D would also get you groundspeed on impact of 120kt
  <br/>
  Do those numbers make sense?

     (it implies a 13:1 L/D which must be pretty close for gear down and flaps 5).
     <br/>
     It places takeoff at 700m before the runway end @ ~185kt
     <br/>
     Based on those, max altitude was c250ft @ 140kt (or the equivalent total energy equivalent), 500m after the end of the runway.
     <br/>
     13:1 L/D would also get you groundspeed on impact of 120kt
     <br/>
     Do those numbers make sense?

  <i>
   Exact location of house, Approx distance of 1.5 km from end of runway to crash site .

   Coordinates of the camera :  23\xb003'42.3"N 72\xb037'03.5"E

  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Approx Camera location of the Balcony is the Red Mark . Can the speed be calculated .  Does the speed line up with the ADS B data , Does it  Gain Any speed after this Balcony point ?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Co-incidently Another Witness is the Grand Mother of the Balcony Teen, she  was closer to the airport as per her . she  is saying that the engine was silent after it passed over (but making sound ,  when it was Over , RAT already deployed?? )  and made offhand comment it was gonna crash . Found that out later .

     . What is apparent is a (substantial) loss of thrust. That's what one can say with some certainty.

  The available video and trajectory information are quite conclusive that both engines stopped producing thrust within 12 seconds of the main wheels leaving the ground. Had partial power of any level remained, the aircraft impact would have been further away from the departure end of the runway. The NE end camera shows by using transit sightings against identifiable structures, that the failure occurred while the aircraft was still within the airport boundary area. The energy state of the aircraft at that time trades off to impact at the correct time and place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On departure at these weights the aircraft would have some assumed temperature thrust reduction from max available on the GEnx -1B70, Unless they were carrying lead, they were around 30,000 or more below the limit weight for a flaps 5 TO. At that weight, around 440k lbs, they would have had a fair OEI climb gradient on one engine, certainly a positive gradient with the gear down, so they lost more than 50% of total thrust. There is no yaw or roll, or inputs to counter a yaw or roll moment so the aircraft was symmetrical at all times, that means losing absolutely no less than 50% of total available thrust at that point on each engine. At 50% reduction. the aircraft would have continued a positive gradient with the gear down and the flaps at the TO setting. It did not, it decelerated at around 1meter sec, or 0.1g deceleration for just maintaining level flight, but it also had to descend and that was worth around 0.05g as well. Instead of having any positive thrust margin, the guys were needing to descend to balance the decrement in thrust of around 0.15g, and that means it has negligible to no thrust from the engines. The full analysis takes more effort as the AOA has increased over the 15-20 seconds to impact, which is increasing the drag of the aircraft rapidly towards the end. For the first 5-10 seconds however, it is not such a great change, but it is still increasing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In level flight, the aircraft would accelerate level at around 0.3-0.4g gear down with both engines running at max chuff. Lose one, and you are back to 0.05-0.1g or so. These guys had far less than one engine remaining, gravity was all that they had going for them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To that end, there is no requirement to have the EAFR readout of the N1, N2, FF, or EGT, the video shows they had no puff going worth a darn. That is basic back of the envelope physics and anyone who does aircraft performance testing would be able to get that answer straight from the video without using a calculator, by the time they had watched the video a couple of times in replay.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I have no qualms on stating that the engines are not operating, the RAT, gear tilt are consistent with the dynamics of the aircraft. This is far simpler to determine the energy state than that of the B738W at Muan, the lack of early video required a couple of iterations of the kinetic energy of the aircraft at Muan to end up with a probable flight path, and most likely estimate of the thrust remaining for those most unfortunate souls.
