     Regardless of how this happened I find it perplexing that a switch with such consequence in either position can be operated with a flick of the wrist.
     <br/>
     Firewall shutoff switches are guarded, fire bottle switches are guarded or require both hands to operate, all require two deliberate actions to operate, except two switches in the middle of the console which do so many consrquential things..
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  They have a reasonably substantial pull-out gate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Over-guarding stuff can have its own issues. People become used to operating the guard as part of normal operations, and it becomes muscle memory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apparently Embraer aircraft inhibit the shutoff switch if the thrust lever is above idle - if you have a stuck thrust lever, you need to use the fire shutoff.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another option would be to have a blocking solenoid (with override button) similar to the landing gear lever while airborne or at high speed.

     The report mentions that the immediate prior flight crew had written up a "STAB POS XDCR" status message, and that troubleshooting was carried out.
     <br/>
     Is it possible that the troubleshooting/diagnostics left the stab cutout switches on the pedestal in the cutoff position, which went unnoticed until liftoff (i.e. upon noticing that the trim wasn't operable), resulting in a reach towards those switches, which are situated right next to the engine cutoff switches?
    </div>

  That seems to me to be a very feasible possibility. Noticing, then accidentally hittting the wrong thing in a quick reaction, especially during a possibly bumpy take-off, then only realsing as power starts to die away... A very simple human error possibility - and the switch location makes it horribly easy, especially ofthe switch locking is dubious. Ergonomics and human factors in design? In a very different environment many years ago I was involved in investigating somethimg rather similar (though not deadly). Taught me a lot about operational human factors and our design assumptions...
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's possible, damn it. How dreadful if correct.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That is also a worrying place to put vital switches. Handy place to rest your arm. I have one person I fly with who tends to rest his hand right on the flap lever (light aircraft) if he is not handling the aircraft. I really don't like that. It's bit like my current car, which has the handbrake 'switch'(!) on the central console, behind the gear lever. Just right for accidental operation - and it has been done.

  Just read all 16 pages - been flying! I think comment \x93why did you cutoff\x94 is not the reaction I would expect from a Training Captain who has just witnessed a trainee turn both fuel control switches off. They would possibly utter an exclamation, but would surely correct the error immediately - this didn\x92t happen for 10secs. The words are more likely to have come from an FO under training who has both hands on the control column and is concentrating on the rotation.
  <br>
   <br>
    Every flight we do as PM we move both fuel control switches to cutoff, 1 after the other, with a gap of about 1 sec between each one. It\x92s a learnt action in response to the phrase \x93shutdown\x94.
    <br>
     Every sim the TC has conducted he will have moved critical switches without much thought in order to setup the sim for the exercise. I remember being slightly shocked one day on the aircraft, having been training in the sim the previous day, that I nearly operated a critical control without thought. It\x92s something I had to consciously guard against after that.
     <br>
      <br>
       There is no rational explanation for doing it though - moving both fuel control switches down instead of moving the gear lever up is not a likely action slip. It seems either a totally subconscious act or a totally deliberate act.
