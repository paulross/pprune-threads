     That is because the take off roll and initial climb looks normal. Things go pear shaped at about the time the gear should be retracting.

  Thanks for answering the question I hadn't yet asked but wanted to confirm!

  <br/>
  I'm still sticking with "Major Electrical Fault" as my most likely cause, and this adds to my suspicions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As I understand it, the landing gear is raised / retracted by electric motor-driven hydraulic pump (pumps?). This/these would create a significant electrical load.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If the plane's multi-redundant electrical system has a fault which is intermittent (the worst kind of electrical issue to diagnose), and which causes the redundancy controls to go haywire (as there are, of course, electronic controls to detect failures and drive the switching over of primary and backup electrical supplies), then this fault could to triggered by a large load coming on-line.  It could even be as simple as a high current cable lug not having been tightened when a part was being replaced at some stage. The relevant bolt might be only finger-tight. Enough to work 99.99% of the time between then and now... But a little bit more oxidation, and particularly, a bit more heat (it was a hot day), and suddenly, a fault.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Having worked in electronics for years, I know that semi-conductors (and lots of other components, especially capacitors [and batteries]) can also degrade instead of failing completely. Electro-static discharges are great for causing computer chips to die, or go meta-stable - meaning they can get all knotted up and cease working correctly - until they are powered off for a while. They can also degrade in a way that means they work normally a low temperatures, but don't above a certain temperature.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anyway, there MUST be ways that the redundant power supplies can be brought down, simply because, to have a critical bus powered from a number of independent sources, there must be "controls" of some sort. I don't know how it's done in the 787, but that's where I'd be looking.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As there is a lot of discussion already about how the bogies are hanging the wrong way suggesting a started but failed retraction operation, and it's now confirmed that the retraction would normally have taken place at about the point where the flight went "pear shaped", I'm going to suggest that the two things are connected.  More than that: I'll suggest that the Gear Up command triggered the fault that caused both engines to shut down in very short succession. Nothing the pilots did wrong, and no way they could have known and prevented it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's going to be difficult to prove though.

  Best post until now in my view. We will find out very soon I think. Gear up command triggered the instant lack of fuel to both engines. I'm not sure on how the fuel flow is dependant on the power supplies on the 787 but I genuinely believe you are very very close to what might have happened here.

     This to me makes more sense; perhaps I`ve got it wrong but in the video the trailing edge flaps definitely look up. Maybe there`s more and they weren`t.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     On a flap 5 takeoff the FMS could be programmed to select climb power at flaps 1 which would seem like an apparent loss of thrust. Same as for F15 to F5 or further.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I`m not sure if they would have cycled the FCS switches or not. But the airplane certainly would have experienced a loss of lift would the flaps been inadvertently retracted. As well as perceived loss of thrust.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     OTOH any castastophic failure which left the gear down would have essentially left the flaps where they were. They are hydraulically activated with electrical backup but it`s wayyyyy slow.

   I believe this is the right wing, (the registration marking appears on the right wing in online photographs of the aircraft). These flaps look down (extended) to me. I believe the structure bottom left, aft of the markings is the right aileron. The flap structure is extended rearward past the aileron structure. You can just make out the rear edge of the LE slat, top right. It is deployed, not retracted.

   I understand things &ldquo;move&rdquo; in an accident sequence. Verifying all this will be straightforward by examining the screw-jacks and of course, the flight data.

     Flashing the seatbelt lights to get people back to their seat quicker, while somewhat unreliable, is for doing exactly that.

     <br/>
     It is not to tell the passengers to brace for impact! That\x92s ridiculous.

  Not a pilot, former CC, but - this was actually in the manuals some years ago at the carrier I worked for - not for pax but as a backup for cabin crew in the event of a PA failure during a cabin prep scenario. Not sure if more than the operator I worked for used it, but it was there and practised during drills. Possible it's a holdover from those procedures (which were from an airline that started in the 40s) not sure if BA ever had the same way back when?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I was going to wait until I'd read the full thread, but since I'm only a few pages off the end I might as well address this point while replying to the above.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  in regard to the 'green and white light' - as mentioned, it is likely he is referring to the exit light above the door, which on the 787 is the universally understood 'running man'.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Now that in itself can be a clue - it's been a while since I was on a Boeing widebody, and my experience is more with Airbus widebody, but the operation 'modes' of exit lights might tell something, depending on the usual operation on a 787.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For example, on Airbus, they stay on until gear is retracted and stowed at which point they switch off and only illuminate again with loss of power, manual emerg lights selection (by FD or CC) or gear extension.
  <br/>
  If the 787 follows the logic of older Boeing models, I believe (if memory hasn't failed me) that they are not on during takeoff but only if "required"- i.e. loss of power or emerg lights selected on by anyone (FD or CC)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If this is the case on 787, that they are not illuminated normally during takeoff, them coming 'on' means two things: gear extension - which we know the gear was already down, or some change in the power status. Is it possible if they were mid-retraction the lights would have gone off then on again? I don't know 787, only 777/A380, but in A380 the lights did not trigger 'off' until the gear doors closed (I could always hear this right before the 'ping' audio cue that the lights were now off.)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Any 787 people care to confirm what the exit lighting actually does? I would imagine the floor/aisle lighting and other lighting would also have come on in a total power loss scenario as well, but IME passengers often don't even notice it coming on during normal pre-departure when it's being check/power modes are switched over, let alone when they're experiencing what this guy did.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it's an interesting comment from the witness and just one more piece to tell investigators what's gone on.

     Question: regardless of the intricacies of various aircraft-specific systems, is it possible to establish from sheer aerodynamics what can/cannot have happened here? Or to put it another way - leaving aside any and all rumours, theories, plausible sights/sounds, and other extraneous details, and focusing solely on the flight path, can loss of thrust be conclusively ruled in or out? Several times now I've seen someone put forth the argument that it's impossible for the flight path to have been as short as it is if the flaps were retracted but the engines were still producing (even derated) takeoff thrust. It might be helpful to reach a consensus on whether this is true or not - if it's inconclusive then we're back to where we already are, but if a conclusion
     <i>

     </i>
     be reached it would probably save everyone a lot of breath going down various theoretical rabbit holes.

  IMO
  <br>
   <br>
    In the CCTV video, the aircraft stops climbing at 00:28. 3 seconds after, it starts visibly descending. At peak altitude, using the 197ft wingspan as a measure, the altitude is around 200ft or below. The fireball is at 00:48, 17s after descent starts visibly.
    <br>
     <br>
      Per google maps and the impact location mapped at avherald, the impact point is ~3990ft from the airport boundary road and about 4200ft from the midpoint of the runway threshold and the airport boundary road.
      <br>
       <br>
        16:1 to 25:1 is what I could find for the 787 glide ratio range (unpowered) with main landing gear down and flaps 5. So the aircraft could cover 16 to 25 ft horizontally for every 1 ft of descent.
        <br>
         <br/>
         With a starting altitude of 200ft, that would imply it could have covered 3200ft.to 5000ft during unpowered descent.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         The actual distance covered, around 4000ft, certainly seems to suggest that the descent was unpowered.

  I've read your cite four times and could not find anything implying that " a momentary electrical event triggered at V1 (still on the ground) and restored after rotation before gear up is selected." I guess you need to explain it to me like I was eight.

  Do not discount the mistaken early flap retraction scenario too easily. Mull on this:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  PF commanded gear up on attaining positive rate of climb, fixating on the HUD.
  <br/>
  PM mistakenly raise flap lever from 5 to Flap 1 gate. Thrust reduced to Climb Thrust. Landing gear remained deployed. Massive loss of lift misidentified as loss of thrust. If any one pilot just had a dual engine failure scenario on a recent sim ride, brain and muscle memory would jump to loss of thrust in dual engine, prompting them to accomplish the recall memory items which called for both engine fuel control switches to CUTOFF and then RUN, and physically deployed the RAT.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There would be immediate loss of thrust with the engine taking time to recover , if at all, at such low airspeed!

  The rest is left for Ppruners&rsquo; imagination.😖🥴😬

     I can't see how gear pins would stop you doing anything more than raising the gear. They don't cause engine failure, RAT extension, or uncommanded flap retraction.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I'm sure it's not the case, but if an attempt was made to raise the gear with the pins still fitted, you would see the main gear doors open as part of the normal gear retraction sequence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This applies equally to a normal gear retraction: the centre hydraulic pumps must have stopped very early for the trucks to be in that position on an "interrupted" gear retraction, with the main gear doors still closed (and presumably locked). Seems unlikely.

     I did raise this earlier... FCOMs say that the bogies remain in the stowed tilt after a gravity drop, but I don't know if that's because the gear has springs to hold it that way without hydraulics, or just they close the valves on the hydraulics so it stays in the last commanded position without pressure.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  The tilt and stow positions are definite hydraulically achieved positions of the truck positioner actuator. I don't think the actuator is spring-loaded to the stow position on the 787, though perhaps they move that way given my earlier statement...
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alternate extension appears to rely on the truck positioner remaining in its previously "positioned" state - stowed - where it has been sitting cold, unloved and unpowered since the gear was previously retracted. Like other Boeing types, the wheel well has some bars to stop the truck moving while it's up and stowed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's remotely possible the main gear priority valves may have prevented more gear movement in the absence of good hydraulic pressure - however this wouldn't stop the nose gear from operating, so not likely.

     Difficult!? Maybe not. If very late the flaps were tagged stowed, and there was a simultaneous gear up command, with FlapDown command, the overload could have failed a GCS. Then it becomes a switching exercise. (Automatics).

     Thanks for answering the question I hadn't yet asked but wanted to confirm!
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I'm still sticking with "Major Electrical Fault" as my most likely cause, and this adds to my suspicions.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     As I understand it, the landing gear is raised / retracted by electric motor-driven hydraulic pump (pumps?). This/these would create a significant electrical load.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     If the plane's multi-redundant electrical system has a fault which is intermittent (the worst kind of electrical issue to diagnose), and which causes the redundancy controls to go haywire (as there are, of course, electronic controls to detect failures and drive the switching over of primary and backup electrical supplies), then this fault could to triggered by a large load coming on-line. It could even be as simple as a high current cable lug not having been tightened when a part was being replaced at some stage. The relevant bolt might be only finger-tight. Enough to work 99.99% of the time between then and now... But a little bit more oxidation, and particularly, a bit more heat (it was a hot day), and suddenly, a fault.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Having worked in electronics for years, I know that semi-conductors (and lots of other components, especially capacitors [and batteries]) can also degrade instead of failing completely. Electro-static discharges are great for causing computer chips to die, or go meta-stable - meaning they can get all knotted up and cease working correctly - until they are powered off for a while. They can also degrade in a way that means they work normally a low temperatures, but don't above a certain temperature.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Anyway, there MUST be ways that the redundant power supplies can be brought down, simply because, to have a critical bus powered from a number of independent sources, there must be "controls" of some sort. I don't know how it's done in the 787, but that's where I'd be looking.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     As there is a lot of discussion already about how the bogies are hanging the wrong way suggesting a started but failed retraction operation, and it's now confirmed that the retraction would normally have taken place at about the point where the flight went "pear shaped", I'm going to suggest that the two things are connected. More than that: I'll suggest that the Gear Up command triggered the fault that caused both engines to shut down in very short succession. Nothing the pilots did wrong, and no way they could have known and prevented it.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     It's going to be difficult to prove though.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Gear and flaps are both hydraulic, and the hydraulic pumps typically act as effective fault-containment - a hydraulic failure or excess load doesn't result in excess demand on the electric side; the pump just starts to run out of output flow/pressure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In addition, the 787 has four main generators and I believe the switching is segregated into at least two controllers, on top of the four separate generator control units.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And again, electrical failure should not cause engine failure - consider QF32 where the wiring to the engine was mostly severed and they had to drown it with a fire truck.

     Best post until now in my view. We will find out very soon I think. Gear up command triggered the instant lack of fuel to both engines. I'm not sure on how the fuel flow is dependant on the power supplies on the 787 but I genuinely believe you are very very close to what might have happened here.

  It's not. Boost pumps should be more-or-less unnecessary at sea level.

     Yes, thanks, I've seen a few comments to this effect, and I have to accept most of what you say. I understand that they have their own dedicated generators and local independent FADECs (or EECs), but I'm trying to use what I do know to attempt to figure this out. I know that there are Fuel Cutoff switches in the cockpit. Somehow, if switched to Off, these will cut off the fuel to the engines, "no matter what". Of course, even that's not true, as the Qantas A380 engine burst apparently (comment in this thread) showed.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Anyway, the thing I'm looking at is how the fuel cutoff switch function could have been activated in some other way. To me, it seems obvious that there are wires that run between the engine fuel shutoff valves and the cockpit / flight control panel (no doubt with relays etc in between). I don't know where those shutoff valves are located, but logic says they should be located in the fuselage, not out at the engines. I also don't know how those valves operate - are they solenoid valves or electro-mechanically driven? Nor do I know where the power to activate those valves comes from, but using my logic, if those valves close when powered off, such as solenoid valves typically do, then the power cannot exclusively come from the engine-dedicated generators. If it did, you'd never be able to start the engines so they could supply their own power to hold those valves open. So, there must be some power (appropriately) fed from the main aircraft control bus to activate those valves - if the rest of what I'm assuming is correct. Anyway, like I say, I don't know enough about the details at this point, but there are many more ways to activate or deactivate a circuit than by flicking a switch. Killing the relevant power supply, for example. A screwdriver across some contacts (for example), another. Shorting a wire to Chassis, maybe. Just trying to contribute what I can.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     You raise another interesting point: "TCMA notwithstanding". Could you elaborate, please? What will happen if the TCMA system, which apparently also has some degree of engine control, loses power? The problem with interlinked circuits and systems is that sometimes, unexpected things can happen when events that were not considered actually happen. If one module, reporting to another, loses power or fails, sometimes it can "tell" the surviving module something that isn't true... My concern is where does the power to the Fuel Cutoff switches come from? Are there relays or solid-state switches (or what?) between the Panel Switches and the valves? If so, is the valve power derived from a different source, and if so, where? Are the valves solenoids, open when power applied, or something else? What is the logic involved, between switch and valve?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Would you mind answering these questions so I can ponder it all further, please? If I'm wrong, I'll happily say so.

    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I believe the valves are almost all bi-stable power-open power-close. When not powered, they remain in the last commanded position.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The valves are located in the spar (hence being called 'spar valves'. The fuel tank is immediately above the engine so it is a very short pipe for suction feeding. Tail mount engines are potentially a different story...

     I've read your cite four times and could not find anything implying that " a momentary electrical event triggered at V1 (still on the ground) and restored after rotation before gear up is selected." I guess you need to explain it to me like I was eight.

  Sorry about that. The reply was aimed at the OP. from a software writers perspective, as you rightly point out it does not imply an electrical event actually occurred. As you raised that query writing software routines (programming) is no different and that's what we're looking for.

     IMO
     <br>
      In the CCTV video, the aircraft stops climbing at 00:28. 3 seconds after, it starts visibly descending. At peak altitude, using the 197ft wingspan as a measure, the altitude is around 200ft or below. The fireball is at 00:48, 17s after descent starts visibly.
      <br>
       Per google maps and the impact location mapped at avherald, the impact point is ~3990ft from the airport boundary road and about 4200ft from the midpoint of the runway threshold and the airport boundary road.
       <br>
        16:1 to 25:1 is what I could find for the 787 glide ratio range (unpowered) with main landing gear down and flaps 5. So the aircraft could cover 16 to 25 ft horizontally for every 1 ft of descent.
        <br>
         With a starting altitude of 200ft, that would imply it could have covered 3200ft.to 5000ft during unpowered descent.
         <br>
          The actual distance covered, around 4000ft, certainly seems to suggest that the descent was unpowered.
         </br>

  Thanks for those numbers. Note, however, the max 787 L/D,
  <u>
   flaps and gear up
  </u>
  , is reportedly 21 (best in class), which casts shade on the credibility of those L/Ds, certainly 25 with the gear down. What is your source?
  <b>
   <i>
    <u>
     IF
    </u>
   </i>
  </b>
  the actual L/D with the gear down and flaps 5 is somewhat lower than 16 and given that starting height and distance traveled are correct\x97and considering that the aircraft might not have been at the speed for max L/D with the gear down and the possibility of a headwind\x97then there must have been some thrust during the descent (it did look to me to be somewhat flatter in that video taken from one side than I would have expected with the gear down, a relatively slow initial speed, and no thrust) or the engines were spooling back up at the end.

     Do not discount the mistaken early flap retraction scenario too easily. Mull on this:

  If the photo of the flaps deployed at the accident site is actually F1 not F5 or if the flaps were pushed out during impact, then this is certainly plausible. I will look for the photo but it's in the thread somewhere. Others are stating they see a gap between the wing and the flap as an argument for the flaps deployed at F5. This was after the decent started..
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, I think their reaction would likely be to apply more power. I know mine would be. But anything is possible!

     There is no evidence of an electrical failure. What evidence? A surviving passenger thought he saw flickering lights? Give me a break.

  Well, could be that. Or...
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Could be that the gear is quite clearly in the forward tilt position (indicating initial gear retraction has commenced), but then the gear never goes up. How does that occur? The gear in the 787 is driven in retraction by the center hydraulic system. How is the center hydraulic system powered? Electrically, via C1 and C2 EMP's. How are those EMP's supplied with power? Engine 1 and 2 (via a bootstrap from L1/2 R1/2 gens). The rat also connects to the center hydraulic system, but importantly, it does not supply hydraulic power to the gear. Only a select number of flight control surfaces.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  So, my question to you is, given you're claiming there is zero evidence of electrical failure, how did the gear move into the forward tilt position, but then not retract?

     Do not discount the mistaken early flap retraction scenario too easily. Mull on this:
     <br>
      <br>
       PF commanded gear up on attaining positive rate of climb, fixating on the HUD.
       <br>
        PM mistakenly raise flap lever from 5 to Flap 1 gate. Thrust reduced to Climb Thrust. Landing gear remained deployed. Massive loss of lift misidentified as loss of thrust. If any one pilot just had a dual engine failure scenario on a recent sim ride, brain and muscle memory would jump to loss of thrust in dual engine, prompting them to accomplish the recall memory items which called for both engine fuel switches to OFF and then RUN, and physically deployed the RAT.
        <br>
         <br>
          There would be immediate loss of thrust with the engine taking time to recover , if at all, at such low airspeed!
          <br>
           The rest is left for Ppruners\x92 imagination.😖🥴😬
          </br>
         </br>

       </br>

     </br>
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  (Sorry, Airbus here and not familiar with Boeing) Flap 5 to 1 reduction on the Boeing triggers autothrust reduction, is that correct? If so, are there any other conditions that need to be met for this to happen like being in some kind of takeoff mode? Just thinking whether this would have potential otherwise in other regimes to cause issues, discontinued approach perhaps.
  <br>
   <br/>
   Am slightly puzzled as to why if flap reduction triggering climb thrust is part of the standard logic (and presumably clean-up technique) then partial dual thrust loss wouldn\x92t be immediately recognised as the classic symptom of gear / flap retraction handling error? I presume Boeing pilots / air India are just as aware of this it as everyone else, strikes me as odd that one would immediately go into full dual EF mode. My instinctive reaction without knowing the Boeing would be to firewall both TLs, would this have worked in the early flap retraction logic scenario? Many thanks all

  I see the YouTube influencers are now shifting their speculation to the RAT deployment and loss of thrust theory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  we have to look at the limited evidence and stop
  <br/>
  speculating on things that have no evidence yet (like the flaps). Aside from RAT deployment the other red flag here is the partial gear retraction. On the 787-8 the bogey will tilt forwards first, before gear doors opens. Not to be confused with the -9 and -10 variants where the gear doors automatically open after liftoff.
  <br/>
  This is an important distinction because the Center hydraulics which is solely electrically pump driven (not engine) only had enough power to tilt the bogey, not open the doors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  so the question is, did the electrical failure (and loss of Center hydraulics power) happen before or after loss of thrust?

     So for those getting in the weeds with one in several trillion (or lower) probabilities of systems failures have you considered that that improper RTOW (with or without improper flap setting), flap retraction / climb thrust trigger, is of much higher probability and has actually happened ?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Anyway I think we&rsquo;ll find out soon if a systems failure was involved.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The FLCH Hold thing (Asiana) was never an issue and well known (at least on our line). And for a crew of 3 (or 4) to press a destabilized approach getting 40-ish knots too slow (!) isn&rsquo;t a systems problem &mdash; it&rsquo;s a breach of basic airmanship.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Have you considered that what you have described won&rsquo;t deploy the rat, initiate the gear retraction sequence or cause the auto start of the APU, all of which there is a fair bit of compelling evidence for?

  777/787 driver here.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Reading a few posts about an APU-to-pack takeoff, or a packs off takeoff on a 787, because of the hot weather, makes me shake my head.
  <br/>
  There is no bleed air on the 787. A packs off takeoff, or an apu to pack takeoff, is never done. There isn&rsquo;t a procedure in the fcom to describe it. It is also pointless. The packs are electrical.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Then the gear.
  <br/>
  When you lift off the runway, the gear doors open REGARDLESS of gear lever position. If you do not raise the gear within 30 seconds, the gear doors close again and you keep the gear down as you apparently desire. In the video, the gear doors are closed again as the airplane flies into the suburb. This requires normal hydraulics in system C, which was apprently available as the doors are closed again.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  takeoff performance:
  <br/>
  I entered all relevant weather parameters into my performance tool for Ahmedabad VAAH, rwy 23, 42 degrees C and no wind, qnh 1005.
  <br/>
  It comes up with flaps 10 as optimum, albeit for a 787-9 (don&rsquo;t have the possibility to calculate for the 787-8) But even the 787-9 is able to depart with flaps 5 in those conditions. Max tow around 230tons.

  The 787-8 doesn\x92t have the early doors feature (i.e. the main gear doors open automatically after take off). The -9 &amp; -10 both have this feature. Later -8 may also do it (unknown if it was introduced on later production models), but as this is an early -8 that is irrelevant.
