     In which way would TCMA act, in the case of an electrical failure just before TO? Would TCMA - if not affected - read a difference in thrust setting (no signal e.g.) to the read engine thrust, which would then lead to an engines shut down?

     I don't want to refute your theory, but given your 30 years of experience---presuming it is relevant--I'd ask you to clarify a few things.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     First, water in fuel is not a novel concept and I would presume that the designers of the 787 knew about it. You've simply stated that water might collect and settle out, but how much water might you expect under those conditions (57% humidity doesn't seem terribly high to me) and what features and procedures are already there to mitigage water contamination issues? Your theory would imply that there basically aren't any. IDK how the tank venting system works, but the idea that some huge amount of water could have condensed in the tank from the outside seems preposterous.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Second, how much water do you think it would take to cause a sustained flameout in one of those engines? Remember that they have automatic continous relight, so you're going to have to sustain your flame suppression long enough for them to wind down completely. I think those engines were probably using something like 2 gallons per second of fuel along with 250lbs of air heated to over 1100F. Any fuel in the mix would burn and the water would be converted to steam so you'd need mostly water for a long time. So if you think a hundred gallons of water could have gotten into each tank then perhaps I'd buy your theory--which, btw, does fit the known facts pretty well. But I think that short of some woeful neglect, Boeing and AI already know about and have methods of dealing with water contamination. At least I hope so.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  OK - Fair Challenges - good post, I'll have a go at answering and simultaneously expanding my own thoughts. In fact I'm not having a go at you, I'm more working my theory....
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Experience. Without wishing to dox myself, I've worked in engineering at a major airline from apprentice through (in no particular order) Line Maintenance, Heavy and Light Maintenance, to technical support and maintenance control on both Boeing and Airbus products, with various qualifications and authorisations along the way. [Hmm - Scrap this sentence?]On the day 9/11 occurred, I should have been making modifications inside a fuel tank instead of staring at the TV with mouth on the floor.
  <br/>
  However, I would describe my experience as broad, yet shallow in respect to this incident. Some of my fleet I know every rivet. Some of my fleet I've only ever seen from a distance. I don't touch airplanes for a living any more. B787 though - is not my area of specialty. I'll dig in, but am not the expert. I am not a systems design engineer, so precise numbers and flow rates, are not what I do. But what the systems do, how they operate, what they look like, smell and taste like... yeah, I'm not a muggle. And I do have access to all the manuals and know how to use them. And - let me be clear, I am speculating. I was advancing a theory. It WILL be some flavour of wrong. The investigation will reveal all.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I Agree, Water in fuel is not a novel concept. Aircraft fuel tanks attract water - fact. How much? It varies. I've sumped tanks and got no water, I've seen drops of water beading about in the bottom of a gallon jug, I've seen gallons of water. I've been so covered in fuel I cant smell it or think straight and taken gallon after gallon not being able to tell if its fuel or water. I also agree that 57% humidity doesn't seem particularly high - its not south east Asian jungle levels - but I'm not an expert at humidity, 32Deg c at 57% humidity at 02:30 am is not going to be comfortable for me though. I looked at recent weather in DEL, and those values were at the higher end of the range.
  <br/>
  Further, I believe the prevailing weather conditions on the ground are less important when it comes to the volume of water getting in. Fuel is cold, or gets damn cold during a 9 Hr flight. Fuel Temperature Management is an issue for our Drivers. So as the fuel is used at altitude, Air enters the tank through NACA Ducts in the outboard end of the wing. Its beneficial to maintain a slight positive pressure, amongst other things to reduce evaporation. (Added complication, there is also the Nitrogen Enrichment system due to TWA800 - but that's more about processing the air in the tank to change the properties and make it non-explosive). Then as the aircraft descends, more air enters as the air pressure increases. Its the humidity of that air in the descent that is going to determine the volume of water entering the tank and potentially the fuel. The water in the air condenses on the sides of the tank because of the cold post-flight fuel. It doesn't dissolve into the fuel, but sinks to the bottom. Ground temperature / humidity and time will likely affect how much water condenses out of that air while on the ground. There won't be a huge amount of air exchange on the ground. Likely if the AC landed at 2am, then from sunrise as the tank warmed up, there would actually be a flow out of the vents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  What Features and procedures are there to mitigate Water? I apologise if my post gave the impression that there are no mitigation processes. There are. Water is well understood in the industry.
  <br/>
  Well for a start, Features / Design. The Aircraft has a water scavenge system. Water doesn't mix with fuel, it sinks to the bottom being about 20% denser than fuel, so at the very lowest point in the tank, the water scavenge system (Powered by the Aft Fuel Pump through a jet pump, a venturi like system) will suck up the 'fluid' at the very lowest point, where the water would collect and in Boeings words 'drip' that fluid into the path of the pump pickup inlet (but I'd describe it more as a 'squirt'). The idea being that a small amount of water injected into the fuel will be consumed by the engines harmlessly.
  <br/>
  There is also agitation. The wing tank pumps are pretty much running constantly, from before engine startup to after engine shutdown. The pumps are quite violent to the fuel and supply more pressure then the engine could ever need. Any excess pressure is dumped right back into the tank, quite close to the pump, in a direction that would further stir up the fuel and help break up any water into suspended droplets.
  <br/>
  This all works if there is a small amount of water in the fuel. The water scavenge pickup is right next to the pump inlet, but a bit lower. Little bits of water get managed. Looking at the pictures of the system, I'd say a couple of gallons of water would do no harm at all.
  <br/>
  But if there was significantly more water in that tank. Guessing 10-30 + gallons, then the pump would be circulating water, or highly water rich fuel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Then there's the suction pickup. Its in the same 'bay' as the aft fuel pump and located a little 'higher' than the pump inlet and water scavenge inlet. But also located between stringers that can separate out the settled water ( I wish I could share the pictures, but more than my job is worth ) I can imagine the suction pickup being in a pool of 'stagnant' water.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I also saw a post from Metcha about the scavenge system blocking with Algae - I don't know about that (B787 not my fleet). But possible that could aggravate things. There's also the reports of the Indian AAIB looking at the Titan Biocide incident. Its possible that might be related and could modify the theory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Procedures - There's the (at my airline weekly I think) procedure to 'sump' the tanks. There are drain points in the tank. Valves that you can push in with a tool and fluid drains. As described earlier (and videos exist on YouTube), you drain about a gallon of fluid and examine it for water. Most often in temperate climates (my experience), there's a few 'beads' of water in the bottom of the jug, moving about like mercury. Except when there's more. Sometimes there's a clear line in the jug, half water, fuel above. And sometimes a gallon of water, that smells like fuel. You drain it until you are sure there's no water.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Could 'that much' water have condensed in the tank? Well - There's the question. I guess the basis of the theory is that on descent into DEL, the wing tanks picked up some very humid air, which settled water into the tanks through the night. Then, as the theory I posited must work, the wing pumps must have circulated and suspended that water into the fuel.
  <br/>
  By design, the water from the CDG-DEL arrival should have been consumed in the DEL-AMD Sector. But desperately clinging to defending my theory (I appreciate this is a hole), lets assume that at DEL the pumps were running for a long time. Lets assume that the pumps allowed the water to be dispersed within the tank prior to being used through the engines. Then - in the DEL-AMD sector, the wing tanks could have picked up more water.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  How much water would cause a sustained flameout? I never posited a sustained flameout. I posited a significant reduction in thrust. Listening back to the rooftop video, which at first we were all listening for evidence of RAT, there's also a rhythmic pop-pop-pop of engines struggling. I think the engines were running, albeit badly. Heavily water contaminated fuel will do that. It doesn't have to be 100% water. Just enough water to make the engine lose thrust. Your 2 gallons per second figure assumes the engine running at full flow. I'm not a figures man, I'll not challenge that, I do recall flowmeters at max thrust spin like crazy. But an engine struggling due to a high perrcentage of contamination, is that using 2 gal/sec? or just trying to? What happens if there is e.g. 20% water in the fuel?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There are also reported incidents of engine flameout / thrust reduction that have all happened at altitude. Incidents that have been recovered due to the altitude and time available. I Posited that the engines would have eventually regained full thrust once the contamination worked though. But 30 seconds of rough engine is very different at 40,000 feet than it is at 100 feet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The theory also relies on a second part - the electrical failure. That the electrical failure causes the fuel supply to switch, a few seconds after the failure. We go, at the point of electrical failure from a pumped centre tank supply to a sucked wing tank supply. It takes time for that different fuel to reach the engine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ive written enough and am tired. Must stop now.

  Yeah, some fuel samples make you go "Whaaat?" And then you keep draining fuel to see how much is in there, and you call up the Maintenance Control folks and tell them "We have a bad sample out here, call those idiots at the fuel farm..."

  <br/>
  Not sure if you are right, and not familiar enough with 787 to check the fuel flow logic, but a friend of mine dead-sticked a single engine trainer into a field due to water in the fuel ... 20 minutes after takeoff.
  <br/>
  It could have happened earlier.

     In reverse order, and the first one being very speculative: The type of battery will likely be highly specific for the usecase, here rugged before anything else. Likely specialized chemistry or one of those hybrid solid state ones. Commonly they trade capacity for other features.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Regarding the recording feature, there's three types of microphone commonly used nowadays: Condenser and Ribbon type are somewhat fragile and require power to record audio while Dynamic type is basically a reverse speaker and is considered rugged. There's an off chance that a Piezzo microphone would be used here as they are basically indestructible but usually reserved for recording while in contact with a large sound transducer. My guess based on that is that we're looking at a dynamic microphone with a run of the mill preamp.
     <br/>
     Depending on the actual electric setup this would yield a handful of different possible installations:
     <br/>
     1) The "Cockpit Area Microphone" (hereby christened CAM because I like abbreviations) is a self contained unit consisting of a Microphone, a preamp and AD converter. This would mean while provided power the digital recording could be passed to either EAFR.
     <br/>
     2) The CAM is a self contained unit consisting of a Microphone and a preamp. This would mean while provided power it could send an analog audio signal to the forward EAFR no problem, but would potentially struggle generating enough of a signal to be picked up by the rear EAFR.
     <br/>
     3) The CAM is just a Microphone. This would mean it requires either no or very little power (even Condenser Mics usually require only Milliwatts) but the signal would be very hard to send over long distances and would require the EAFR to have a preamp.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     In general it is audio engineering 101 to place a preamp as close to the source as possible to avoid noise. Thus I would rule out 3. It has both ups and downs to convert the analog signal to a digital signal, and there is a possibility they'd do both. In either case I am confused from an audio engineering standpoint why the rear EAFR would not pickup audio from the CAM if the forward EAFR does. Unless the rear EAFR is fed (audio) data only via BUS, which would be an interesting choice.
     <br/>
     Also keep in mind that historically the CVR was also located in the tail section and very much received an analog signal over the entire distance. There's really no technical reason this wouldn't be possible, I routinely use far longer cables when running audio signals at concerts and those can't use compression because it would dumpster sound quality.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     So, yeah, I don't understand why there would be a mismatch between the recordings of either EAFR, unless there was something else preventing all signal transmission towards the rear EAFR. The CVR in the rear has been a thing for 80 years now.
     <br/>

  SLF here. Mods - please delete summarily if this does not contribute to the discussion, I have no wish to waste anyones time. No 'AI' was used in the preparation of this post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  My understanding is that, as you say, the CAM has a preamp. That preamp can be powered by the RIPS that accompanies the forward EAFR.
  <br/>
  In addition, I believe there is a single
  <i>
   analogue
  </i>
  connection from the CAM+preamp to the aft EAFR in addition to the analogue connection from the CAM+preamp to the forward EAFR. I believe, but am not sure,that the other flight-deck audio (headsets) is carried digitally over the fibre-optic network to the aft EAFR. The network may or may not be in operation in the event of an electrical failure: I simply don't know.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The publicly available information I can find is not stunningly clear about this.

    Two EAFRs are installed on Boeing 787 aircraft, one forward and one aft. The forward and aft recorders are powered by the left and right 28V DC buses respectively. The forward recorder is equipped with a recorder independent power supply (RIPS) to provide backup power to the recorder for approximately 10 minutes once left DC bus power is lost. Both recorders record the same set of flight data independent of each other.
   </div>
  </div>
  So the forward EAFR is powered from the
  <i>
   left
  </i>
  28V DC bus with the possibility of being powered by the RIPS, and the aft EAFR is powered from the
  <i>
   right
  </i>
  28 V DC bus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  What I have been unable to determine is whether the right and/or left 28 V DC buses are powered from the main battery in case of failure of the AC power supply. To my untrained eye, it looks like the Captain's flight displays are powered from the main battery in extremis (28 V DC - C1), but that there are various circuit breakers, that could be automated, that may or may not allow or prevent other loads (such as the F/O's flight displays (28 V DC - C2), or the aft EAFR, being supplied by the main battery, (See link to diagram). There could well be very drastic automated load shedding.

  <br/>
  If the
  <i>
   right
  </i>
  28 V DC bus was unpowered for any period, it follows that the aft EAFR was not recording for that period. This would make the forward EAFR important in case of a power failure that prevented the right 28 V DC bus from providing power.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All the information that is unclear to me will be transparently clear to the crash investigators. But it seems to me that the aft EAFR will not hold data for any period that the right 28 V DC bus is not operating. Whether that applies to this incident is an open question.

     SLF here. Mods - please delete summarily if this does not contribute to the discussion, I have no wish to waste anyones time. No 'AI' was used in the preparation of this post.

     My understanding is that, as you say, the CAM has a preamp. That preamp can be powered by the RIPS that accompanies the forward EAFR.
     <br/>
     In addition, I believe there is a single
     <i>
      analogue
     </i>
     connection from the CAM+preamp to the aft EAFR in addition to the analogue connection from the CAM+preamp to the forward EAFR. I believe, but am not sure,that the other flight-deck audio (headsets) is carried digitally over the fibre-optic network to the aft EAFR. The network may or may not be in operation in the event of an electrical failure: I simply don't know.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The publicly available information I can find is not stunningly clear about this.

  I am starting to see the hamsterwheel references now.
  <br/>
  Having two combined recorders is already more backup than what had previously been the norm, in addition theres the independently powered area mic going analog to the front recorder.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The common models I have checked the sheets for also provides a digital output (which is probably sent to the aft recorder via normal busses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Having a seperate analog line going to the aft recorder would be several Kg of extra weight, and probably a substantial amount of loom design and paperwork for what is then a backup to an already redundant system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hence, imho why this signal only goes to the forward recorder. It is already a \xabbonus\xbb.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The power for microphone and preamp is in the &gt;1watt range range, completely insignificant.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I am still interested in reliable information as to what is expected to be on the recorder of an aircraft which has lost the generators, what about the battery powered prinary instruments? Does some systems and the aft recorder come online with the RAT or would everything be down to the one cockpit mic? Surely not?
