  Can\x92t see any smoke but Ahmedabad has a lot of bird activity around the airport. Quite a lot more than other airports in India.

  Not trying to drift the thread away but the 8300 hours being quoted is apparently incorrect and is taken from the relatively new DGCA online database which requires pilots to upload their hours post 2019. None of the pilots have bothered filling up their entire logbooks prior to that. The operating captain was on the Airbus 310 fleet in air India, which probably dates back to him being in the company since the 90s

  Something did happen for sure when the aircraft was obscured behind that shed or building during the takeoff roll. It definitely does yaw to the right and has a slight bank and counter correction thereafter. A previous poster also mentioned it. I tried to quote him my browser hung up. The winds weren\x92t that strong at that time for the aircraft to yaw into the wind after rotation.

  The survivor mentioned that he felt the pilots are trying to give \x93race\x94 to the engines but it wasn\x92t working, Presumably in car terms. The word is used predominantly in India in lieu of revving.
