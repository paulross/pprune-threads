     Timeline of known events with source attribution from the preliminary report:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     08:07:33 ATC: Takeoff clearance
     <br/>
     08:07:37 A-SMGCS: Aircraft starts rolling
     <br/>
     08:08:33 EAFR: V1 153kts
     <br/>
     08:08:35 EAFR: Vr 155kts
     <br/>
     08:08:39 EAFR: Gnd-Air mode transition
     <br/>
     08:08:42 EAFR: Max IAS 180kts, Eng 1/2 Cutoff switches activate within 1 second of each other
     <br/>
     08:08:42 CVR: "Why did you cut off", "I did not" (exact time not specified)
     <br/>
     08:08:42 A-SMGCS: RAT deployed (exact time not specified)
     <br/>
     08:08:47 EAFR: Both engine N2 below min idle. RAT hyd pwr commences
     <br/>
     08:08:52 EAFR: Eng 1 cutoff to RUN
     <br/>
     08:08:54 EAFR: APU inlet door opens (auto start logic)
     <br/>
     08:08:56 EAFR: Eng 2 cutoff to RUN
     <br/>
     08:09:05 ATC: Mayday call
     <br/>
     08:09:11 EAFR recording stops
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Fuel cutoff switches operated within 1 second of each other suggests to me that the locking mechanism wasn't working as per (SAIB) No. NM-18-33. Any loose item could have accidentally (or not) operated the switches (including hands).

  Really? It suggests to me and I would imagine the vast majority of us who have flown modern Boeings that they were physically moved, by one of the crew, one at a time, the question is why.

     It seems to me that there must have been further dialogue after the bland "I didn't". To have nothing reported after that two-line exchange, until the MAYDAY at 08:09:05, is a highly suspect omission from the interim report. In a two-crew cockpit, facing a sudden dual engine rollback just after rotation, I find it very hard to believe that this two-line exchange was the only interaction captured.

     They are guarded. To refresh everyone's memory here's a photo from the previous thread.

  Having studied human factors, that's not what I would call a switch guard.  This is what I would call a guard:

  in that fraught moment of engines not functioning very close to the ground, the last thing to do at this critical moment when you don\x92t really known what has happened is communicate a MayDay. With the buildings looming up fast, the action required is to attempt to restart, as seems to have been done by a pilot putting the fuel switch to \x93run\x94, but too late to rescue aircraft. I think the timing of the MayDay call is strange given that the scenario called for Aviate, Navigate\x85 then Communicate.
