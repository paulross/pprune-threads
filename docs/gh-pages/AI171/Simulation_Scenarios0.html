       A week after the crash of AI-171 on June 12, at least three Air India training pilots on the airline's Boeing 787 fleet attempted to recreate likely scenarios in Mumbai that resulted in the accident in which 260 people were killed. The pilots attempted to simulate electrical failures that could cause a dual-engine flame-out, resulting in an inability of the aircraft to climb post takeoff.
       <br>
        <br>
         <b>
          They were unsuccessful
         </b>
         .
         <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
          <li>
           To ensure they were accurate in their simulation scenarios, the pilots replicated the precise trim sheet data of AI-171. A trim sheet is a document used in aviation to calculate and record an aircraft's weight and balance, ensuring the center of gravity is within safe limits for takeoff, flight, and landing. The trainer-pilots also simulated the failure of a single engine, left the undercarriage of the aircraft down, and retracted the flaps of the 787 completely.
          </li>
          <li>
           What's more, an improper take-off flap configuration was also selected. This would make it even more challenging for the 787 to climb away on a single engine. Takeoff flaps are adjustable surfaces on an aircraft's wings that are extended during takeoff to increase lift, or the ability of an aircraft to climb. In all of the scenarios described here, AI-171, with a single operational engine, was able to gain altitude safely.
          </li>
          <li>
           Air India's Boeing 787-8's General Electric GEnx-1B67-K turbo-fans have been uprated to produce a significant 70,000 pounds of thrust each. These are among the most powerful engines developed for civilian aircraft in the class of Boeing 787.
          </li>
          <li>
           Pilots on Air India's Boeing 787 fleet are not trained to deal with a dual-engine failure at an altitude of less than 400 feet, as in the case of AI-171. This would be considered 'negative training', in other words, training for scenarios where the chances of successful recovery are technically not possible. Put simply, a dual-engine failure at the altitude AI-171 was flying in, would have likely resulted in a crash.
