  Re FDR and CVR, remember the 787 uses EAFR(s) instead - one in tail and one in nose.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Comments above "they will already have been read" - suggest search and read India press links, and the (new) India AAIB lab ability to read data recorders, e.g. one timed at
  <span style="color:#484848">
   June 15, 2025 00:08 IST. It may well be the first 'political' issue about this accident in where the recorders are sent. If India is chosen, maybe they will take their time with a new lab, and watched over by the world and other AIB representatives? I believe the investigating state 'controls the release of information' (or not). Whilst the UK AAIB are there, as their website says they have 'expert' status, which I suspect means not a lot of involvement in the politics.

     Flightradar24 (I know, I know) has a short blog on the (very minimal) ADS-B data available. There's only around 4s of useful data available from 21ft o 71ft altitude (last packet received 0.8s later), But: it's odd seeing the speed DROPPING shortly after takeoff. Even if you calculate total energy (kinetic + potential) it's falling, i.e. the engines aren't producing thrust. (In fairness reported speed doesn't match my calculated speeds, but even with mine I don't see power). Also: if you assumed no thrust from 71ft AGL @ 172kt you'd reach 250ft at 160kt. Isn't that roughly where they ended up? Noisy data, but this suggests the engines stopped producing power almost as soon as the wheels left the ground. (If someone could download a CSV of another similar flight and send to me I can do a compare and contrast of Total Energy)
    </div>

  If you wanted to an analyse this further:
  <br/>
  1. You might mathematically start at TE=0 at start of takeoff-roll, and treat drag as minimal until rotation.
  <br/>
  2. Typically rotation will be to say 15deg nose up, but flight path will be much less (5deg? for heavy hot 787). Once that rotation is complete, aircraft will stop accelerating. Therefore engine thrust (energy gain) equals gain in PE - drag x time.
  <br/>
  3. This might give a better insight into where energy gain/loss became unusual?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Looking at the raw data in your post, and given the speeds are likely IAS based i.e. can be affected by wind, I don't see the IAS loss as equating to dual engine failure i.e. zero thrust - but could be wrong. Once a heavy airliner gets to lift off the acceleration is reduced (drag) and the decays to zero as PE gain kicks in.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ditto a time / distance to the crash site might give some energy info? Looks like the crash site is 50' (?) below the airfield (Google Earth will give more).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I think you are doing an interesting study on the absence of other info

  Thanks for that... makes the energy analysis more accurate/relevant

  As per T28B but expanding:
  <br/>
  Part 1: Fly the aircraft in Pitch such that ground impact occurred at minimum IAS compatible with minimum RoD.  If 120KIAS is stall speed, roughly 130KIAS at zero RoD.
  <br/>
  Part 2: Fly the aircraft in Roll such that the distance flown from Part 1 was the least hazardous to aircraft occupants and people on the ground.  Given the starting conditions I doubt if more than 10AoB would be practical?
  <br/>
  Part 3: Try and do whatever to restore thrust.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a guess Part 1 was attempted, Part 2 was hardly a choice to achieve much and Part 3 needs to await the investigation, but I surmise little could or was done.

     Both engines run from the center tank on takeoff if it has fuel in the tank which was the case on this flight.

  It would be good to get an FCOM reference for this, and/or definitive answer from a current 787 pilot (if they know
  <img alt="" border="0" class="inlineimg" src="https://www.pprune.org/images/smilies2/eusa_silenced.gif" title="Oh"/>
  ).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the A320 if the centre fuel pumps are selected on pre-start, they run for 2 mins after start and then turn
  <i>
   themselves
  </i>
  off until Flaps selected to 0 (i.e. well after takeoff), when they turn
  <i>
   themselves
  </i>
  on. As far as the crew are concerned they were
  <i>
   selected
  </i>
  on from pre-start onwards [long retired A320 so forgive me if in error].
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If certification demands this 'complexity' it would seem surprising the 787 does not have a similar system? Are we sure the 787 centre tank 'higher pressure' pumps are:
  <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
   <li>
    Actually running on takeoff?
   </li>
   <li>
    If running, they are providing centre tank fuel
    <u>
     directly
    </u>
    to both engines, and not, say, centre tank fuel to wing tanks, and then wing tanks to engines?
   </li>
  </ol>

     (Admin/Mod)Folks, it appears that the message isn't getting through.
     <br/>
     There were two professional pilots on that flight deck.
     <br/>
     It is not acceptable to effectively accuse
     <u>
      <b>
       both
      </b>
     </u>
     of a criminal act, because there is no evidence to identify which hand -
     <u>
      <b>
       if either
      </b>
     </u>
     - moved the fuel switches, or for what purpose or reason.
     <br/>
     Unless and until any such evidence is published by the relevant authorities, kindly desist from doing so out of respect for your professional colleagues.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  The Mods have stuck to this principle, which I shall try to adhere to.
  <br/>
  This preliminary report is just that, but maybe consider the issues the Indian AAIB have had to address in publishing it. They will have a similar concern to the pP mods, maybe more so since any apparent accusations directed at the pilots may lead to physical retribution.
  <br/>
  I therefore conclude great care has been taken to "sanitise" what the AAIB know, or at least strongly suspect, (from EAFR) into the report. They have conspicuously failed to identify which of the pilots was each half of the conversation they have not repeated the exact words, there's a lot missing (was positive rate ever called, was rotate ever called, any discussion about putting FC back to Run, who/how flying aircraft meanwhile). As a result we, the reader, should step back and not over-interpret this sanitised report.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Secondly, given the mod statement above,
  <b>
   <u>
    if
   </u>
  </b>
  a criminal act is suspected by the AAIB, this will likely trigger all sorts of 'primacy' issues in the investigation i.e. police? AAIB? or joint? and all the history that involves (SAS Linate?) - in Europe we have 996-2010 Article 12 para 2, but India?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <b>
   Summary
  </b>
  : For good reason I believe this report has been very carefully worded, sanitised with great care, and as such easy to inappropriately speculate what went on.
