     You may be surprised to know that TCMA doesn't require that, it just requires a differential between commanded and actual thrust.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     It has never triggered during takeoff until now. Maybe it still hasn't been. We'll see. Given there is an actual example of a 787 in the wild shutting down both of it's engines when it shouldn't (ANA), I'm surprised how complacent people are that this couldn't be the cause..Software can always have weird corner failures that could never have been thought of or tested.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Yes. I simplified. The point stands that the throttle needs to be pulled back, as it was in the ANA event, because that was a landing and not a take-off.

      A parallel is drawn to the ANA incident. However, this would require not only a fault in the air/ground logic but also a sensed discrepancy between T/L position (not necessarily idle) and thrust output on both engines simultaneously.

   First, you posted a good summary. I'd have added "unanticipated hardware fault" and "unanticipated software fault" as generic causes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Note that the thrust lever actuators are wired to the FADECs, and that the TCMA gets the T/L position from that. For TCMA to trigger, it has to determine that its FADEC (on that engine) failed to achieve a commanded reduction in thrust. So we're either looking at a weird, unprecedented edge case, or a FADEC failure, or both.

     Just so I have this clear, are you saying that the implementation of the TCMA functionality involved
     <b>
      no
     </b>
     new components being added to the pre-existing FADEC? Are you saying, in effect, that the two switch relays described in the TCMA patent application, which relays and their configuration achieves the described two channel redundancy, were already there as components or are mere depictions of what the software does itself?
    </div>

  It has been mentioned before that this capability existed as part of the N2 overspeed protection: the FADEC would shut down a runaway engine by cutting its fuel before it disintegrates.

     I am not suggesting you are wrong and, as I've said before, the descriptions and schematic in the patent application are just 'big hands / small maps' concepts. However, if TCMA functionality "is simply a bit of software in the FADECs", merely sending a 1 or 0 or other signal into a point in the pre-existing FADEC that already had control over fuel cutoff (with the TCMA software merely monitoring data busses, rather than direct sensor outputs, to work out thrust lever position and whether or not the aircraft is 'on the ground' for TCMA purposes) I for one would really like to know that for sure and get my head around the implications.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  The thrust lever sensors are wired directly to the FADEC (and hence the TCMA). No data bus is involved with this item.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With a MCAS crash, it required a hardware problem with an AOA sensor, used as input to a correctly working MCAS, to cause the aircraft to behave erratically. With a correctly working TCMA, I believe it'd require two hardware problems to get TCMA to shut down the engine, as there'd have to be an implausible thrust lever reading, and a FADEC/engine failure to process it within the TCMA allowed range ("contour"?). On both engines, separately and simultaneously.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That leaves a software problem; it's not hard to imagine. The issue is, at this point it's just that: imagination. I could detail a possible software failure chain, but without examining the actual code, it's impossible to verify. We simply don't have the evidence.
  <br/>
  I could just as well imagine a microwave gun frying the electronics on both engines. An escaped hamster under the floor peeing on important contacts. A timed device installed by a psychopathic mechanic. There's no evidence for that, either.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This process is a way to psychologically cope with the unexplained accident, but because it lacks evidence, it's not likely to identify the actual cause. We've run the evidence down to "most likely both engines failed or shut off close to rotation, and the cause for that is inside the aircraft". Since the take-off looked normal until that failure, we have no clues as to the cause hidden inside the aircraft. We need to rely on the official investigation to discover and analyse sufficient evidence. The post-crash fire is going to make that difficult.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <b>
   "Both engines failed or shut off close to rotation" explains all of the evidence
  </b>
  : it explains an unremarkable take-off roll, loss of lift, absence of pronounced yaw, loss of electrical power, loss of the ADS-B transponder, RAT deployment, the noise of the RAT banging into place and revving up, emergency signs lighting up, a possible mayday call reporting loss of thrust/power/lift, and a physically plausible glide from a little over 200 ft AAL to the crash site
  <strike>
   50 feet (?) below aerodrome elevation
  </strike>
  .
  <br/>
  It explains what we saw on the videos, what the witness reported, where the aircraft ended up, and the ensuing sudden catastrophe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I don't believe we have
  <i>
   evidence
  </i>
  for anything else right now&mdash;I'd be happily corrected on that.
  <br/>

  <br/>
  Edit: the evidence of the crash photo with the open APU inlet door, and the main gear bogeys tilted forward, are also explained by the dual engine failure/shut off.

     We have been told that the logic (ie true or false) signal G is determined from the Weight-on-wheels sensors and the RadALT. It is reasonable to suppose that the designers still wanted TMCA to function after a hard landing where some landing gear components had failed.
    </div>

  Yes, overspeed on either resolver channel A or B alone will trip the TMCA fuel-cut logic

  G is a single Boolean that FADEC derives from Weight-On-Wheels (MLG and NW) and radio-altimeter. Iit stays \x93ground\x94 until all WOW sensors go inactive (i.e.
  <i>

  That's very unlikely. Ground/air logic uses small hysteresis (tens to a few hundred ms), but not in the multi-second range

     At that point, the total energy of the system would have comprised of the kinetic energy of the aircraft travelling at Vr, the rotational inertia of the engines and the potential energy of whatever fuel is beyond the cutoff valves.
     <br/>
     Q5: Would this total energy have been sufficient to get the aircraft 100ft into the air?
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Let's do the math very quickly:
  <br/>
  Kinetic energy with a weight of 200,000kg, at Vr = 150kn = 77m/s: E_kin = 600MJ
  <br/>
  Rotational energy of a GEnX engine is hard to calculate as I don't find reliable values for the rotary inertia. I found some for a GE90 and could roughly estimate 100MJ of rotational energy for each engine. However, I seriously doubt that this energy could be effectively used to gain thrust, as the thrust will drop very quicjkly after the fuel is cut off.
  <br/>
  the required potential energy for a 100ft climb of a 200,000kg 787 is around 70MJ.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This ignores aerodynamic drag, still, 100 ft of climb remains energetically feasible.
  <br/>
  However, it as been pointed out several times that the actual climb was higher than 100ft. Already for 200ft I would doubt the validity of my statement above.

     What happens when the 2 disparate processes that form TCMA disagree?

  We have an authoritative answer to that question, but only if the TCMA implemented in the FADEC used on the 787 engines functions in the way described in conceptual documents: If one of the two TCMA 'channels' for an engine 'thinks' the shut off criteria are satisfied but the other channel doesn't, the channel which 'thinks' the shut off criteria are satisfied 'wins' and the fuel shut off valve for that engine is therefore given a shut off signal.

  I perfectly understand that there is much talking about TCMA here.
  <br/>
  There is no direct evidence of what caused the crash but several indirect evidences point towards a near simultaneous shutdown of both engines without any visual clue of a catastrophic mechanical mishap. This leads to suspecting near simultaneous fuel starvation of both engines.
  <br/>
  As the purpose of TCMA is shutting down the High Pressure Shut-Off Valve (HPSOV) and thus the fuel feed of an engine, it's normal to collect information on TCMA, on how it works, and on what data feeds it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, I hardly understand why there is no similar discussion about the spar valves and the systems that control their opening and closure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I understand that the B787 spar valves are located in the MLG well, or at least are maintained from within that well.
  <br/>
  If the engine shutdown happened when the gear retraction was commanded, that's a location commonality (although it's very unlikely that a mechanical problem happened in both wells at the same time).
  <br/>
  Also I understand that there are several systems that command the opening or closing of the spar valves:
  <br/>
  - opening: "Engine control panel switch" set to "START", or "Fuel control switch" set to "RUN"
  <br/>
  - closing: "Engine fire handle" pulled out. (I wonder if "Fuel control switch" set to "CUTOFF" also closes the spar valve).
  <br/>
  Are there direct wires running from these controls to the valves or is there a pair of control units receiving these signals and controlling the valve actuators?
  <br/>
  If the latter is true, where are these control units? I guess that the likely location is the aft EE bay. Are they beside each other?

  And each FADEC is unique to the engine in which it is hosted. So whilst these may be "autonomous" they still rely on data external to the engine itself such as WoW and Rad Alt where they hold more "sway" than they do in the flight deck.
  <br/>

  Are these values recorded in the FDR?

     Strange, as I would have estimated this quite differently based on layman's intuition. If one assumes average values, then the approximate flight profile of AI171 according to layman's guidance certainly fits a situation in which the engines failed at or even very shortly before rotation.

  IMO, if those engines failed just after rotation, there is no way that jet would have got anywhere near 200ft, especially if the fuel was "cut off", as opposed to back to Idle.

     Is VR about 20 to 30 knots above the landing speed?

  At 420k lbs (310k lb ZFW+110k lb Fuel), the (takeoff) V2 Flap 5 is 157kts. The (landing) Vref for Flap 5 I estimate to be at least 160kts (the FCOM I have has no figures for Flap 5 landings; F20 Vref is 154; the manoeuvre speed for Flap 5 is 189). Typically, you'd probably be at V2+15 when you get established in the climb after rotation.

     Would these 20 to 30 knots of additional energy be sufficient to lift the aircraft to a good 200 ft during and after rotation?

  No. With a pitch attitude of around 15\xb0, that's quite a bit of weight being supported not only by the wings but by the engine thrust vector. Cut that and you stop going up very quickly. Note Sailvi's comment above.

     If the angle of attack is then successively reduced, wouldn't the airplane still have enough lift to glide for a few seconds before losing all or nearly all lift?

  ANY reduction in pitch attitude would cause the climb to cease immediately. These aircraft are going so slowly, relatively, and the drag is so high that any small change in pitch attitude will cause an increase in descent rate with very little increase in speed (or no lessening of deceleration).

     Wouldn't it be the case that if the thrust had only ceased five seconds after rotation, the aircraft would then have reached a good 250 ft with the engines still running and then another good 200 ft in normal conditions before the speed was used up to about 150 kn?
    </span>
   </div>
  </div>
  Not IMO. Basically, the only reason this jet is flying is because of the whopping long thrust vector out the back. It's already almost back at minimum speed anyway for flap 5 so there is very speed to trade. In this case, I wouldn't be trading anything, because the speed reduction rate would be too fast.

     AI171 probably didn't reach an altitude of 400 to 500 ft above ground (in relation to the airport), did it?

  My estimate is around 200ft (one wingspan) and I hypothesise the engines were producing plenty of thrust until about 7 seconds, before it stops climbing at around 12 seconds after liftoff.

  , I think you're exaggerating the residual thrust effect at lower RPMs. Of course 70% would get you round the pattern but you're at a much lower drag config and you're going much faster, again less drag. And are improved-climb takeoffs in the 787-8 even a thing?  I can't see a two-stage rotation.

  Hello, this is my first post on pprune; as a 787 pilot I&rsquo;m also puzzled by this accident. All seem to agree that for some reason there was a complete electrical failure and RAT deployment. With a complete electrical failure all six main fuel pumps fail. Each engine also has two mechanically driven fuel pumps. On takeoff, if there is fuel in the center tank, it will be used first, pumped by the two center tank pumps.
  <br/>
  My airline&rsquo;s manuals don&rsquo;t go into much detail, but I read on another site that if both the center tank pumps fail, the engine driven pumps aren&rsquo;t able to suction feed well enough from the center tanks to sustain engine operation. If there was fuel in the center tanks, a complete electrical failure would soon lead to center tank fuel pumps failure (all fuel pumps failure as stated previously) and fuel starvation of both engines. A rescue from this situation would be an immediate selection of both center tank fuel pumps OFF (not if my airline&rsquo;s non-normal checklists) and waiting for successful suction feed from the L and R main tanks to occur, this would take a number of seconds.

  Great first post (IMMHO!) If this is correct, then I think you are onto something very significant. No expert, just an outside the box thinker who has been trying to see what ordinary (non-pilot-blaming) explanations there could be for a near simultaneous dual engine failure. I imagine a complete electrical failure leading to fuel starvation from lack of pump feed pressure from the centre tank would not result in apparently near simultaneous engine failure, but who knows? (Aren't there (suction) bypass valves here, but maybe they get stuck after long non-opening - instead long subject to closing pressures?)  This could have been the case here as my experience suggests the probabilities aren't small.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  FWIW, according to earlier posts, the fuel load was about 50T, leaving about 18T in the centre tank, so (I think) about 25-30% full. A full centre tank might allow engine pump suction to work fine, but this might not? (Contrary to what some have said.)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anyway, FWIW, not everyone agrees with RAT Deployment - see recent post by shep69. Would love to know why he doesn't go with RAT deployment...

  Sorry but that doesn't really make sense. Once the power failed and all pumps are off where is the point of switching of the center fuel pumps off? Without power they aren't running anyways.
  <br/>
  Furthermore the preference of the center tank while it's filled is just by the higher fuel pressure those center pumps deliver. There is no valve that controls that, which might be triggered by switching off pumps.

     Just for me to understand: How would you shut off the engine driven pumps if there is no electrical connection whatsoever? If there is a "powered" valve, wouldn't this (also) cut fuel suppy in case of a complete electrical failure?

   </div>
  </div>
  Wouldn't "fail safe open" imply that the valves would open on loss of control signals or power.  They don't.  They stay just where they were before loss of power or control signal.   If I understood tdracer's description of the HPSOV it can only be open or closed.  That's not true of the spar valves which are motor driven and can stop in any intermediate position if power is lost.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The only way this is relevant to the accident is if the shut off valves had been commanded closed and then power had been lost.  The valves would not open.

  I am not a Boeing pilot, but a Bus pilot. I believe that what you're describing is prevented by the certification regs for transport category airplanes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the 320 (equipped with the old system (fuel pumps), not the newer system (transfer valves)) the center tank pumps are inhibited when the airplane is airborne with the slats extended.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Check these certification rules:

     Hello, this is my first post on pprune; as a 787 pilot I\x92m also puzzled by this accident. All seem to agree that for some reason there was a complete electrical failure and RAT deployment. With a complete electrical failure all six main fuel pumps fail. Each engine also has two mechanically driven fuel pumps. On takeoff, if there is fuel in the center tank, it will be used first, pumped by the two center tank pumps.
     <br/>
     My airline\x92s manuals don\x92t go into much detail, but I read on another site that if both the center tank pumps fail, the engine driven pumps aren\x92t able to suction feed well enough from the center tanks to sustain engine operation. If there was fuel in the center tanks, a complete electrical failure would soon lead to center tank fuel pumps failure (all fuel pumps failure as stated previously) and fuel starvation of both engines. A rescue from this situation would be an immediate selection of both center tank fuel pumps OFF (not if my airline\x92s non-normal checklists) and waiting for successful suction feed from the L and R main tanks to occur, this would take a number of seconds.

  Crossky, welcome to this hamster wheel.

  <br/>
  If you go and chat to the engineers, have a look in the IPC or MM I Ch 28, you should find a good description of the fuel boost pumps. It's been a while but I recall they are Eaton designs, the general arrangement is similar to the B777. They both have a suction feed that permits fuel feed in the event of a loss of all boost pumps. The only impact of that arises at high altitude and high thrust levels, where the engine driven fuel boost pumps may capitate and reduce the available fuel feed resulting in a lower thrust level.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Refer page 12.20.02 in the TBC's B787 FCTM, or search for "SUCTION FEED".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At sea level, full thrust will be achieved without any boost pump on the aircraft. Recall that the CWT boost pumps are known as Override boost pumps, they are feeding from the CWT when there is fuel and they are running, as the output pressure is higher from these pumps than the 2 wing boost pumps. Whether there is fuel in the CWT or not, or the CWT pumps are energised, is immaterial to whether fuel will be supplied to the engine driven fuel pumps.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Note that with BA038, the fundamental problem was blockage of wax/ice formed in the piping that blocked the FOHE, and that will cause a problem with those engines that have such architecture, but is not associated with the availability of the boost pumps themselves. Even then, the engines did not technically fail, as they have both done simultaneously with the B788 of AI 171, BA's engines were running but not able to provide significant thrust due to the FOHE blockages.

  All of which has been discussed and for the wing vortices and the fuel feed has been explained quite comprehensively, along with the fuel cut offs: have you not read these posts only made recently?

  It\x92s a possibility (as is virtually anything that doesn\x92t break the laws of physics) but all the training, practicing and checking would have been to emphasise SOPs, which are to leave all the engine controls where they are until you have done a proper interactive diagnosis at a safe height with the flightpath assured.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Where the meme has come from that jet pilots have to shut down engines as quickly as possible I don\x92t know but it is incorrect. If you left a failed engine without securing it for 5 minutes, little to no harm would come of it. Even if it was on fire (which is not necessarily flames, just higher than normal temperatures inside the nacelle) they are certified to be in this condition for some considerable time before it becomes a problem. Yes, I think the phrase \x93without undue delay\x94 could be used for a fire indication but that\x92s a minimum of 400\x92AGL in Boeings and does not absolve you of all the cross-checking and CRM that should happen with an engine shutdown. This is practiced/checked at the least every 6 months in EASA land and any attempt to rush a shutdown at low level would lead to a debrief and more training/checking.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To put it this way, control of the aeroplane and lateral/vertical navigation is far more important than doing stuff with a failed power plant. Something like an ET should be absolutely prioritised over engine drills.

     Wouldn't "fail safe open" imply that the valves would open on loss of control signals or power. They don't. They stay just where they were before loss of power or control signal. If I understood tdracer's description of the HPSOV it can only be open or closed. That's not true of the spar valves which are motor driven and can stop in any intermediate position if power is lost.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The only way this is relevant to the accident is if the shut off valves had been commanded closed and then power had been lost. The valves would not open.
    </div>
   </div>

  Agreed,  my brevity in reply doesn't tell the whole story.
  <br/>
  What I mean is that with engines running, fuel shut off valve(S) open, if there is a loss of electrical power the valves will remain open.
  <br/>
  This is standard design on all the gas turbine engines I have worked on.

     I looked for a B787 EFATO memory item in the QRH but could not find one. Perhaps a current B787 pilot could confirm?

  I don\x92t really know what you are talking about. I\x92m current 787 and have flown many types including airbus prior to this. EFATO is normally an SOP handling exercise, not a memory item in itself. Memory items on nearly all types cover the specific drill for the engine only in all regimes of flight\x85ie severe damage/separation, engine limit exceedance/surge, engine fire. ie you\x92d never say \x93I\x92ll take the memory items for an engine failure after takeoff\x94.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  EFATO handling is similar on most types too\x85in essence, contain any yaw, rotate, get the gear up and either trim it out or (787) let the aircraft trim it out\x85.AP in and once safely climbing away at a defined altitude diagnose followed by memory items if applicable. 787 you don\x92t action any drills until above 400ft so it would be extremely unlikely this crew actually got the stage of touching a fuel control switch.
