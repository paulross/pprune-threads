    The aircraft achieved the maximum recorded airspeed of 180 Knots IAS at about 08:08:42
    <br/>
    UTC and immediately thereafter, the Engine 1 and Engine 2 fuel cutoff switches transitioned
    <br/>
    from RUN to CUTOFF position one after another with a time gap of 01 sec. The Engine N1
    <br/>
    and N2 began to decrease from their take-off values as the fuel supply to the engines was cut
    <br/>
    off.
    <br/>
    In the cockpit voice recording, one of the pilots is heard asking the other why did he cutoff.
    <br/>
    The other pilot responded that he did not do so.
    <br/>
    The CCTV footage obtained from the airport showed Ram Air Turbine (RAT) getting deployed
    <br/>
    during the initial climb immediately after lift-off (fig. 15). No significant bird activity is observed
    <br/>
    in the vicinity of the flight path. The aircraft started to lose altitude before crossing the airport
    <br/>
    perimeter wall.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As per the EAFR, the Engine 1 fuel cutoff switch transitioned from CUTOFF to RUN at about
    <br/>
    08:08:52 UTC. The APU Inlet Door began opening at about 08:08:54 UTC, consistent with
    <br/>
    the APU Auto Start logic. Thereafter at 08:08:56 UTC the Engine 2 fuel cutoff switch also
    <br/>
    transitions from CUTOFF to RUN. When fuel control switches are moved from CUTOFF to
    <br/>
    RUN while the aircraft is inflight, each engines full authority dual engine control (FADEC)
    <br/>
    automatically manages a relight and thrust recovery sequence of ignition and fuel introduction.
    <br/>
    The EGT was observed to be rising for both engines indicating relight. Engine 1&rsquo;s core
    <br/>
    deceleration stopped, reversed and started to progress to recovery. Engine 2 was able to
    <br/>
    relight but could not arrest core speed deceleration and re-introduced fuel repeatedly to
    <br/>
    increase core speed acceleration and recovery. The EAFR recording stopped at 08:09:11
    <br/>
    UTC
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As per the EAFR data both engines N2 values passed below minimum idle speed, and the
    <br/>
    RAT hydraulic pump began supplying hydraulic power at about 08:08:47 UTC.
    <br/>

     The switch state could be either on or off in that position. However, the CVR makes it pretty clear that the switches were moved deliberately to off. Just not why. Also, remember the report says one switch was moved then the other. Not together.

  The exact quote was

  "The aircraft achieved the maximum recorded airspeed of 180 Knots IAS at about 08:08:42 UTC and immediately thereafter, the Engine 1 and Engine 2 fuel cutoff switches transitioned from RUN to CUTOFF position one after another with a time gap of 01 sec."

  <br/>
  Does anyone know what the sampling frequency of the data is? If we get one readout per second, then it's possible that a one second difference could only be a millisecond difference in real life, which doesn't necessarily rule out an accidental bump.
  <br/>
  If there truly was a second of difference, there aren't many other options than an intentional act. Not necessarily with the purpose of crashing the plane though (confusion, hallucination, distraction, ..)

  I remember the SAIB. I assessed it as &ldquo;recommended&rdquo; to all our customers and all agreed. I then raised work orders to check all fuel cut-off switches for the missing locking bar conditions. None were found defective. The preliminary report says the switches were found in the Run position. There is no mention of whether the locking mechanism is correctly in place. We need to wait for the full report for that, as this matter is still under investigation.

  The phrase in the report is "switches transitioned from RUN to CUTOFF position".
  <br/>
  Does the FDR actually have some input of the physical position of the switches or is it just measuring the output signal voltage
  <br/>
  which might be changed by a momentary short from liquid or swarf.
  <br/>
  Both signals go to cutoff within 1 second but then one recovers four seconds after the other.
  <br/>
  Surely a pilot discovering a turned off switch would have both back on in less than four seconds.

  The Fuel Cut Off switches on a 787 have to be pulled up (out of \x91run\x92) and whilst held up, they are then moved backwards to the  \x91cut off\x92 position. They are designed this way so loose objects

  It confirms that both fuel cutoff switches were moved to OFF at Vr, within a one second interval which is as extreme and inexplicable as it gets.

  Neither pilot was likely speaking in order to be recorded for posterity, so that 'conversation' makes perfect sense in a situation where there is high stress and a great deal of confusion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As to the report not closing off speculation, that isn't it's purpose. It is there to report the facts as they are found. It must also be said that speculation is not in any place but the eye of the beholder.

  Out of interest, hypothetically if the captain was an instructor, is there a possibility that any kind of muscle memory from simulated failures in the simulator may have been triggered?

  <br/>
  Let\x92s say that you are having to retrain another pilot on v1 cut handling whilst you occupy the P1 seat. Temptation may be to use the fuel cut off switches to save time rather than going back to the sim operator panel to reprogram the failure.

  That was with 10 seconds delay vs. 13 seconds for engine 2.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Time was spent with the verbal exchange, and then perhaps each pilot expected the other to put the switch back?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anyway, the preliminary report also establishes that the aircraft had only 3-4 seconds of powered flight. (Would the gear lever be operated that early?) Everyone who saw that from the CCTV video, pat yourselves on the back.

  Mayday call, dual engine failure, RAT deployment all confirmed.

  TCMA was a red herring, the aircraft was firmly in air mode as the accident unfolded, and the thrust levers were at takeoff thrust the whole time.

      I have read most of the thread (old and new). As a lawyer working in forensic investigations, I am constantly involved in problem-solving. My field of work also includes complex investigations related to insolvencies, which almost always require an analysis of the causes behind a specific, established outcome. In doing so, I naturally also have to deal with probabilities. However, it often turns out that the most likely or plausible explanation does not reflect what actually happened.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Many of the considerations I\x92ve read fail because the simultaneous failure of both engines is extremely unlikely, leading to a constant search for higher-order causes. It was suggested that an incorrect altitude setting led to an early thrust reduction. However, this would not explain the deployment of the RAT (Ram Air Turbine), especially since the thrust could have been readjusted. FADEC and TCAM are highly redundant systems, and TCAM failure is unlikely due to WOW (Weight on Wheels) logic, making a simultaneous engine failure after VR equally improbable.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      With that said, and with regard to my question concerning the AD that relates to the fuel control switches (FCS), my thought\x97and it was nothing more than that\x97was that their activation becomes more probable if it can occur accidentally. That\x92s how I came across SAIB: NM-18-33.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Another user then brought up an iPhone. That notion would, of course, be dramatic\x97but how unlikely is it really that after approximately 10,000 actuations between December 2013 and June 2025, the two FCS no longer lock perfectly? Considering all of this, I find it quite conceivable that the A/T slightly reduced thrust in the first seconds after VR (e.g., if an incorrect target altitude had been entered) and that an object lying between the thrust levers and the FCS could have pushed the FCS into the \x93Off\x94 position. Due to the buttons on top of the switches, which provide some resistance, it\x92s even possible that the object both pulled and pushed them.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      But all of this is speculation. The investigation report will bring clarity.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Even if my theory is not confirmed, I still believe that the positioning and mechanism of the FCS are suboptimal. Switches of such critical importance should be better protected, and movements in the area in front of the switches (like reducing thrust) should not follow the same direction as shutting off the fuel supply. A different switching direction alone would provide more safety\x97especially considering that the FCS are protected laterally by metal plates.
     </div>
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  ﻿
  <br/>
  I wouldn't put too much significance in the "01 second" since this still is close enough for an unintentional cause.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No matter what: The design and position of the fuel cut off switches is potentially prone for mishaps.

     Background
     <br>
      The Boeing Company (Boeing) received reports from operators of Model 737 airplanes that the fuel control switches were installed with the locking feature disengaged. The fuel control switches (or engine start switches) are installed on the control stand in the flight deck and used by the pilot to supply or cutoff fuel to the engines. The fuel control switch has a locking feature to prevent inadvertent operation that could result in unintended switch movement between the fuel supply and fuel cutoff positions.
      <b>
       In order to move the switch from one position to the other under the condition where the locking feature is engaged, it is necessary for the pilot to lift the switch up while transitioning the switch position. If the locking feature is disengaged, the switch can be moved between the two positions without lifting the switch during transition, and the switch would be exposed to the potential of inadvertent operation.
      </b>
      Inadvertent operation of the switch could result in an unintended consequence, such as an in-flight engine shutdown.
      <br>
       <br>
        ...The table below identifies the affected airplane models and related part numbers (P/Ns) of the fuel control switch, which is manufactured by Honeywell.

  That isn't the human factors question.  All it does is tell us that one of the flight deck crew was unaware of the issue as it was initiated. It doesn't tell us which, and it doesn't tell us why.

     Agreed, it's most unfortunate that that the preliminary report hasn\x92t closed off speculation, it's simply created opportunity for more.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     It confirms that both fuel cutoff switches were moved to OFF at Vr, within a one second interval which is as extreme and inexplicable as it gets. Then it gives us a CVR quote that\x92s so neutered, "Why did you cut off?\x94 / \x93I didn\x92t\x94, that it raises more questions than it answers. If the goal was to reassure or clarify, it\x92s had the opposite effect.

  Well, it\x92s narrowed it down to 3 possibilities:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Action slip
  <br/>
  SAIB NM-18-33
  <br/>
  Intentional.

  The report states that

   "the Engine 1 and Engine 2 fuel cutoff switches transitioned from RUN to CUTOFF position one after another with a time gap of 01 sec"

  Again, from the report
  <i>
   "As per the EAFR, the Engine 1 fuel cutoff switch transitioned from CUTOFF to RUN at about 08:08:52 UTC.

  I would be interested to know whether sounds consistent with the actual fuel control switch being moved have been picked up on the voice recorder.

     <br/>
     In my airline (we don\x92t fly the 787 but our engine masters are in a near identical position on our jet) we have had *multiple* incidents of engine masters being manipulated accidentally in flight. This has involved both flight deck and cabin crew. This has meant a re-emphasis on SOPs regarding the centre pedestal but you still routinely see this broken on the line in minor and major ways from time to time
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Thus the lengthy sticky thread on "shutting down wrong/both engines." Brain farts happen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I don't think it's ridiculous to suggest that perhaps one crew intended to manipulate a different control (stab trim cutout?) and flipped the fuel cutoff instead, maybe not even realizing what has happened. Sure, unlikely, but essentially every aspect of airline accidents is unlikely.

  Anyway, here goes:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A. Misconfiguration or wrong takeoff data &mdash;
  <b>
   OUT

  I. Bird strike/FOD &mdash;
