     Firstly. I find all the speculation about hearing the RAT suspect. Not that I doubt observers heard something sounding like a RAT, but that I question the fidelity of the low bit rate and bit depth of the audio to reproduce the difference between the sound of a deployed or non-deployed RAT. The audio sounds quite distorted and I have zero confidence that anyone could accurately tell. Secondly, is the speculation about best glide performance. Any private pilot knows that best glide does not exist until the pilot pitches the nose down and establishes it. As far as I can see, there is no time nor visible indication that the nose pitched down. What I see is the aircraft mushing down to the ground with the nose high and just short of a stall.

  You need to read the previous posts. We are NOT relying on ear witness's alone, 2 independent PPRUNE folks did detailed audio comparisons and the evidence is compelling. Plus people close to the Boeing test airfields in the US who have heard RAT tests 500+ times. The RAT was out, that's a 99% certainty.  What else would make a sound like prop blades getting close to or perhaps exceeding the speed of sound?

     I have not read it all so pardon me if this has been covered already. The A350 had two separate cases of engines shutting down due to spilled coffee on the center console. It was just a thought that occurred to me, a forgotten water bottle left on the center console during rotation? Pilots are usually quite conscious about the liquid free areas but this happens at home, in the office... If someone with insight care to explain how the electrics is protected I am listening...
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  It was posted but in a nutshell:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Airbus assumed their pilots would not spill their drinks but they did, and this resulted in an un-commanded dual engine shutdown. Now they have to use Sippy Cups!
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing assumed their pilots would spill their drinks so made the system robust enough to tolerate liquid spills without shutting down the engines.

     The PF could've been task focused flying manually, following the FD's and not expecting the sinking feeling of losing the lift. The PM has made the mistake without knowing. ie. he/she has selected the flaps all the way to UP believing that the gear was now retracting. Both pilots now think the gear is retracting, they have full thrust but are sinking into the ground. "Professional crews" like Air France for eg. have made way worse decisions. Slats are extended because they are the last to retract. I'm not convinced the RAT is deployed. If it has deployed it could've been a last ditch effort for the crew to bring the fuel control switches from RUN to CUTOFF &amp; back to RUN believing they've had a dual engine failure. This would account for the RAT if it did deploy. The APU inlet door could've been open as well because they were carrying out an APU to Pack takeoff.

  The RAT was almost certainly deployed. 4 different sources.
  <br/>
  The Flaps were not retracted. Visible at the accident site plus many other sources agreeing they were indeed down.

  APU will autostart when all engine power is lost. Potentially explaining why the inlet door was open or partially open at the accident site. Mentioned in several previous posts
  <br/>
  On a 787-8, the main bogies tilt as the 1st action of the gear retract sequence. As stated in previous posts. I don't think this happens unless gear is selected up. So the conclusion was, gear was selected up. One caveat, IIRC, there was some discussion around a failure could have caused the bogies to tilt without Gear up being selected but I don't recall the outcome.

  As for the Air France remark, un-necessary IMHO. Let's respect the crews please.

     Firstly. I find all the speculation about hearing the RAT suspect. Not that I doubt observers heard something sounding like a RAT, but that I question the fidelity of the low bit rate and bit depth of the audio to reproduce the difference between the sound of a deployed or non-deployed RAT. The audio sounds quite distorted and I have zero confidence that anyone could accurately tell. Secondly, is the speculation about best glide performance. Any private pilot knows that best glide does not exist until the pilot pitches the nose down and establishes it. As far as I can see, there is no time nor visible indication that the nose pitched down. What I see is the aircraft mushing down to the ground with the nose high and just short of a stall.
    </div>

  You need to read the previous posts. We are NOT relying on ear witness's alone, 2 independent PPRUNE folks did detailed audio comparisons and the evidence is compelling. Plus people close to the Boeing test airfields in the US who have heard RAT tests 500+ times. The RAT was out, that's a 99% certainty.  What else would make a sound like prop blades getting close to or perhaps exceeding the speed of sound?
