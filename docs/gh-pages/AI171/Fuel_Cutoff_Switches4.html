     On the 767 and 747-400, when you shutdown an engine and the IDG goes offline, there is a momentary 'glitch' in the electrical power system as it reconfigures for the available power source - this is why you see the flight deck displays flicker and return, and the cabin lights momentarily flicker. As a result, most of the avionics boxes 'reset' - this is quick, but it's not instantaneous. This shows up in the FDR data - sometimes as 'no valid data' for a few seconds, or as garbage readings of zero or 'full scale'. Now, looking at the FDR data, it's easy to simply disregard the data, so normally no big deal.
     <br/>
     \x85
     <br/>
     If there is a fuel cut at high power, the engine spools down incredibly rapidly - a second or two from max power to sub-idle. Assuming the fuel cut wasn't commanded by the flight deck fuel switches, the electrical system won't know it's coming, so it can't reconfigure until after the engine generators drop offline - and you're going to get that power glitch. Nearly every avionics box on the aircraft will reset due to this electrical glitch, and the FDR isn't going to get useful data for a few seconds (and then, only from the stuff that's on the battery bus).
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Thank you for confirming.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is not only happening to the FDR but to any reciever on the data busses. And likely not only when the engine spools down  and power supply switches but also when power busses come offline and bus bar breakers activate or in any severe fault in the electrical system involving large currents, possibly arching shorts.
  <br/>
  Hence my comments on SISO and input filtering and verification in the closed thread.

     There is at least one thing common to the TCMA on each engine: The TCMA software.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     My recollection may be inaccurate, but wasn't there something in the software for 787 generator control units that would cause generator shut down if the aircraft was 'powered up' for a continuous 248 days? Same software, so all 4 generators would shut down. Is my recollection inaccurate?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     What we do know, for sure, is that the TCMAs have the same 'authority' and effect as the fuel cut-off switches. The difference is that the crew control the latter.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I'm pretty sure the software is written independently. Same as Airbus, you don't want the same software error on duplicate critical systems.

  So, also as an outsider when it comes to cockpit engineering, there is one commmon "system" in the sense of the very close physical location, the two engine systems have in common, and that is the physical cut off switches and their behind the panel connections.
  <br>
   <br>
    It wouldn't take a kids pool of liquid to intefere with those?
    <br>
     (I asked this question previuously, in the middle of a long text, but the discussion had a very different direction then.)
     <br>
      <br>
       What are possible ways of a common failure/triggering of these contact points somewhere in their physical installation in the cockpit?
       <br>
        Remember when the A350 had to be modified only 5 years ago to not allow coffee spill to turn off engines.
        <br>
         What about the same location in the B787?
         <br>
          What are the actual switches? Are they purely traditional electromechanical contact switches? How do they make contact, ie. what are the actual gaps and dimensions? Are they digital in some sense? How are they protected? Are both installed the exact same way, or are they installed with different physical screening/protection/orientation as so to make the failure modes different? How are they physically kept apart, isolated from each other to avoid interaction and/or common failure. What is the physical distance involved there? What about the cables and connectors to them? separate or bundled in the same wiring harness? Or even in Mil or D-sub connectors? I find one description of them as a common(both in one box) line replaceable unit with quick connects. Both of them in the same unit with a common connector? Sounds wild if so!
          <br>
           Just had to ask, and hope it doesn't disturb the great discussion too much.

     I was struck by a comment in this or the earlier thread that I cannot now find. It was to the effect \x96 I\x92m paraphrasing \x96 that fuel shut off results in an almost immediate cessation of thrust.

  Spot on, there's so much fuel being sucked at that power setting, it would be super quick and presumably at near enough to the exact same time.
  <br>
   <br>
    I assume (rightly so) that you're focused on what could cause them to fail at what appears to be the exact same time given the absence of yaw and any correcting rudder input.
    <br>
     <br>
      One the face of it, it could only be throttle or fuel supply, with fuel supply only being able to be cut off by valves so abruptly.  Any kind of blockage or similar wouldn't give such a result, even if there was a low fuel condition, short of the pickups being exactly right next to each other, presumably that wouldn't give the outcome we've seen.

     I agree with what you posted however the solution is so simple that I can&rsquo;t believe a professional flight crew would not handle it without much of a blip. Push the trust levers forward.

  Salvi, just spitballing here, a low alt capture is simple to rectify, but if you&rsquo;re not expecting it ( perhaps a wrong MCP alt setting) coupled with a HUD , which focuses your attention on it, not the thrust levers, and add to the mix an inexperienced F/O. I can

  also see in the final moments of desperation, reaching down and turning the Fuel Control Switches, OFF-THEN-ON, in the hope that an engine will come to life, if they believed that the engine was dead. This may be the reason the RAT extended? Just thinking out loud.

  Consensus here is, that both engines where stopped by a closing fuel cut off valve, wich yields a fast loss of N2. The generators  then shut down very quick as does the thrust in a few seconds. This is supported by the quick RAT extension which allowed the crew to control the flight. The APU did autostart too. A thrust changed with the thrust leaver to idle is much slower and would not result in the dramatic change in performance. Thrust set to idle will not engage the RAT since the electric generators would still work. So a thrust leaver  changed to idle or any intervention by Autothrust (AT) would not yield to the RAT extension. Something or someone activated a fuel cut off. How and why that happened is the big question, the investigators have to answer.

  A naive glider pilot question: if fuel cut off was (inconceivably) selected, would both fuel control levers have been flipped downwards from Run to Cutoff? And if they were then immediately flipped back to the Run position, how much time would have been needed to achieve enough thrust to maintain altitude?

  The 787-8 landing gear retraction is primarily hydraulic, using the center hydraulic system for the main operation. However, the alternate gear
  <i>
   <u>
    extension
   </u>
  </i>
  system utilizes a dedicated electric pump to pressurize fluid from the center hydraulic system for gear extension. Obviously due its size and weight and staged retraction, the effort required to raise and stow the gear greatly exceeds that required for extension.
  <br>
   <br>
    The main gear retraction/extension is controlled by the center hydraulic system.
    <br>
     <br>
      It is apparent that the hydraulics failed when the engines shut down after breaking the down-locks and leaving the Main Landing gear bogeys in the tilt position, ready for a
      <b>
       <i>
        next step
       </i>
      </b>
      internal stowage and door closure (that was now never to happen). It is therefore apparent that the dual engine failure and consequent automated RAT extension was precipitated by this gear selection or retraction cycle and thus likely to be either WoW micro-switch or 5G Radar altimeter-effect associated. Due to accumulator depletion, the electric pump load would have spiked to replenish it. This may have precipitated the dual engine shutdown due to an unfiltered electrical surge affecting the Ground/Air microswitches (or a local 5G transmission affecting the RADALT) and resetting the TCMA.
      <br>
       <br>
        The RADALT? Another plausibility? Because of the furore over a spasticated frequency allocation by the US FCC, the US FAA had finally &ldquo;bought in&rdquo; and declared that individual nations and their airline operators were responsible for their own 5G frequency spectrum allocations and for taking essential steps to ensure mitigation of the interference effects upon aircraft automated landings and other
        <i>
         critical systems
        </i>
        caused by their own national approved 5G spectrum decisions. It was admittedly a situation calling for extensive modifications to (and shielding for) the three radar altimeters fitted for redundancy considerations to all modern airliners... for Category 3 ILS approach and landing in zero/zero visibility conditions.  The RADALT also features in many air-ground sensing applications. (eg the 747-8).
        <br>
         <br>
          This was an unusual FAA
          <i>
           &ldquo;passing of the buck&rdquo;
          </i>
          to manufacturers such as Honeywell etc. (to sort out with client operators). But then again, it was not the US FCC&rsquo;s right to dictate the specific 5G frequencies internationally. These spectrum allocations now vary over the wide selection of 5G phones available (and also nationally). 5G Radar Altimeters constitute a part of the ground/Air sensing that changes the TCMA from ground mode (able to fuel-chop engines) to the air mode (inhibited from doing so)... Ground activation is acceptable ...where fuel chopping of uncommanded thrust can prevent runway sideways excursions or runway length overruns. The question now becomes: &ldquo;Is it more (or less) safe having an automated fuel-chopping capability on BOTH your left and right, rather than leaving it to the pilot to react via his center console fuel cut-off switches... in the unlikely event of a runaway engine after landing (or during an abandoned take-off)?
          <br>
           <br>
            <b>
             5G Frequency Variations
            </b>
            <br>
             <br>
              The frequencies of 5G phones vary nationally based on the frequency bands allocated and used by different carriers in each country. In the United States, for example, carriers such as AT&amp;T, Verizon, T-Mobile, and others use a combination of low-band, mid-band, and high-band 5G frequencies.
              <b>
               Low-band 5G frequencies typically range from 600 MHz to 1 GHz, mid-band 5G frequencies range from 1.7 GHz to 2.5 GHz, and high-band 5G (mmWave) frequencies start at 24 GHz and go up to 40 GHz
              </b>
              . These frequencies are allocated by regulatory bodies such as the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and can vary between countries based on spectrum availability and regulatory decisions. In other countries, the specific frequency bands used for 5G may differ, leading to variations in the frequencies supported by 5G phones. Additionally, the deployment of 5G networks can also influence the frequencies used, with some countries focusing more on sub-6 GHz bands while others prioritize mmWave technology.
              <br>
               <br>
                5G interference? It may be an avenue worth exploring?

  Agree. The two most important controls in the aeroplane, sitting there in a wide-open, unprotected space. After an incident where a manual fell off the coaming (can't remember if a switch got bashed into the Off position), we put guards on our non-787 fuel switches:

  Yes, and probably much to @Roo's disgust, we had an instance where an engine shut down all by itself in the cruise; it was concluded that the fuel switch hadn't been "locked" in the ON position and was just sitting on the edge. It was then highlighted to all of us that the FCOM stated "give it a good jiggle" to make doubly sure it was locked in ON.

     They comply with a military standard that requires 40,000 cycles though the locking part is tested 20,000 times by just pulling to its full extent. Or something like that. How well that testing matches real world use is debatable.

  This isn\xb4t quite right. They could both have had a malfunction without this being an issue until something or someone hit them at the same time (e.g. on rotation). It\xb4s just another theory which isn\xb4t less plausible than many others.

  Obviously. If yours is the switch I think it is (with the metal, unscrewable dome) then yes, it is very different. Very hard to "balance" yours in the middle.
  <br/>
  Not so the Boeing fuel switches: they can be relatively easily "sat" in the middle, on the centre raised bit and could be bumped either way. Hence our (non-787) FCOM saying make sure you jiggle them when you put it in the On position to confirm it's locked there.
