     How can an MCP ALT setting error explain the sequence seen in the videos? If the MCP ALT is set too low the aircraft levels off, reduces thrust to maintain set speed, - AND MAINTAINS MCP ALTITUDE. Sure it will get the crew's attention but it will not result in a uncontrolled descent.

  if the autopilot is engaged. Easy to get tunnel vision on the Flight Guidance cue in the HUD.

     Exactly like the action of lifting the flap lever out of detent before moving it. What is significantly different is that you would have to do it twice. It is that which makes it improbable unless intentional.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  The requirement to lift the cutoff switch out of the detent before moving it is an important point. However, those switches are close together and unless the the detent requires significant force I suggest that they could be operated together with one hand if that was an intentional action.

     But as previously posted a recorder is only as good as the systems that provide the data to it. If those systems, or some of those systems, are not powered the data is simply not available to be recorded. You need the DFDAU (or equivalent) to be powered and you need the systems that feed data to the DFDAU (or equivalent) to be powered and operational.

     Edit to add - RIPS will likely maintain CVR function.

  Correct, on the 787 it's the forward EARF that has the RIPS, and it will continue to record inputs from the CAM.

  Yea, I think you're right - DO-178 is aviation software - now that I think about it, DO-160 might be electro-magnetic effects (i.e. HIRF/Lightning).  It's not something I need to worry about anymore so it's not something I make a point of remembering

  The wiring between the two (per engine) FADEC channels is separate and isolated from each other.  In the areas potentially subject to cross engine rotor burst damage, that wiring is physically separated by a considerable distance.  About the only place where the Channel A and B thrust lever resolver wiring is close proximity is in the thrust lever quadrant.  We've been designing FADEC aircraft for 40 years - and the requirements for isolation are detailed and well understood.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I've
  <i>
   repeatedly
  </i>
  posted I don't know the details of the 787/GEnx-1B FADEC air/ground logic - and I know even less about the 787 air/ground system architecture.  That being said, I think the whole air/ground is a bit of a red herring - even with a false air/ground indication, it's going to take a very major flaw in the FADEC logic for TCMA to activate without several other things happening (such as the thrust levers being moved to idle - which all by itself is going to make for a bad day if it's done at rotation).

     That is not what the TCMA logic is supposed to do. Only high thrust with the thrust lever idle should trigger the TCMA.

  Yes, there's another snag in the million dollar Q for the explanation. If the MN4 microprocessor can run amok, so could perhaps the TCMA not exactly act as intended. But I take in both your pertinent comments and will (as per the mods advice) from now on sit on my hands and only read until the prelim report hopefully soon!

  As you say, it would not find algorithmic errors , but it would detect hardware errors. Problem is that three channels are required, best of two approach, since with a two channel system, one can never be sure which one is at fault. I believe Concorde used the three channel approach for some systems.

     The issue with 5G was the potential for interference with some models of radio altimeter. I think we have been told that RA is used in 787 air/ground logic. We have also been told that air/ground state is used to enable TCMA.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I think it very unlikely that 5G interference was a contributing factor but I can see why someone would be interested in asking the question.

  </div>
  I think the cellphone interference concern is indeed partly focused on radio altimeters, and also on some voice comms.  5G shouldn't be problematic for the altimeters though.  Modern ones operate at around 4.2-4.4 GHz, IIRC, and that's pretty far from any of the three bands 5G uses.  I seem to remember reading that EASA tested for 5G interference and that it permits 5G use in the cabin.  Whether that's true or not I don't know.  And it wouldn't be easy, or even realistic, to police it in an airliner cabin.

  sorry if it was not clear : when you move the switches to cutoff and the thrust levers are above idle imho the engines would NOT cutoff , the command would be ignored .

     In the CSV data set that can be downloaded from that link the first point with altitude data is 1630 ft short of the departure threshold. That point is 575. The highest alt recorded in the data set is 625. All the points with altitude data overlay the departure runway. I do not understand how anyone is using this data set to determine the maximum altitude which was way past the departure end.

     Edit to add - I have made no attempt to correct the raw ADS-B altitude data. There is no need to make any correction to see altitude gain.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I posted my first-cut analysis in the earlier thread.
  <br/>
  I've had a bit more time to analyse now.
  <br/>
  Those ADS-B data points (and particularly the rate of deceleration) are EXACTLY what you would expect to see from a total engine failure at or very shortly after TAKE-OFF
  <br/>
  (it implies a 13:1 L/D which must be pretty close for gear down and flaps 5).
  <br/>
  It places takeoff at 700m before the runway end @ ~185kt
  <br/>
  Based on those, max altitude was c250ft @ 140kt (or the equivalent total energy equivalent), 500m after the end of the runway.
  <br/>
  13:1 L/D would also get you groundspeed on impact of 120kt
  <br/>
  Do those numbers make sense?

      Commanded engine cutoff - the aisle stand fuel switch sends electrical signals to the spar valve and the "High Pressure Shutoff Valve" (HPSOV) in the Fuel Metering Unit, commanding them to open/close using aircraft power. The HPSOV is solenoid controlled, and near instantaneous. The solenoid is of a 'locking' type that needs to be powered both ways (for obvious reasons, you wouldn't want a loss of electrical power to shut down the engine). The fire handle does the same thing, via different electrical paths (i.e. separate wiring)."
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Search this thread for "HPSOV" if you need confirmation of the quote.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Note there are two shut off fuel valves per engine - the HPSOV and the Spar valve. Both stay where they are if power is lost.

     Wouldn't "fail safe open" imply that the valves would open on loss of control signals or power. They don't. They stay just where they were before loss of power or control signal. If I understood tdracer's description of the HPSOV it can only be open or closed. That's not true of the spar valves which are motor driven and can stop in any intermediate position if power is lost.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The only way this is relevant to the accident is if the shut off valves had been commanded closed and then power had been lost. The valves would not open.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Agreed,  my brevity in reply doesn't tell the whole story.
  <br/>
  What I mean is that with engines running, fuel shut off valve(S) open, if there is a loss of electrical power the valves will remain open.
  <br/>
  This is standard design on all the gas turbine engines I have worked on.

     Thanks for those two quotes. I had only used the first one in my previous reference to HPSOV operation. I have only been involved with Boeing spar valves and not any HPSOV. However, I do not see that spring shutoff when less than 300 psi is in conflict with staying open if electrical power is lost.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Hopefully tdracer will provide more detail if/when he re-joins the discussion.

  HPSOVs within the FADEC are solenoid controlled but hydraulic (fuel) actuated. The valve will remain in the last commanded position if power is lost. This is very unlikely as FADECs have a small gearbox driven generator that supplies basic electrical power and engine speed info for engine control and command functions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  LPSOVs are motor driven sliding gate valves 28V DC from a hot battery bus.

  I believe the GE EAFR continues to function as both FDR and CVR for a minimum of 10 minutes following a power failure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However you are correct in that the requirements only specify that the CVR functions and the CAM must continue to operate.

  By the time you're down to EMER GEN you usually know what the problem is and most systems with parameters that could be recorded on the FDR are unpowered so what's the point of trying. The CVR with a RIPS at least helps us to try understand how or why the events to regain control after that failed.
