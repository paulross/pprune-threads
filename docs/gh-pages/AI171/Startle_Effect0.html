  On an auto throttle equipped aircraft, if for whatever reason the computer commands a thrust reduction, what will happen if you have you hand on the thrust levers applying take off thrust?
  <br/>
  I wonder if startle effect would prevent a normally trained pilot from moving the thrust levers forward once the aircraft does not climb as expected?

  Here is a very unlikely scenario. It may be possible that there was nothing wrong with the aircraft.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  We have been told the experience levels of the pilots but not how long they have been flying the 787.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 787 is very automatic and, in my experience, the easiest aircraft to fly. It does a lot of things for you and reminds you of things that you may have forgotten to do. For that reason, in my opinion it is also the safest aircraft around. However, you have to understand what the automatics are doing in order to manage it correctly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By putting the departure route into the FMC you set up the lateral navigation and also the vertical navigation including speeds and altitudes. After take-off the FMC will command you initially to fly at up to V2 + 20 until flap retraction ( normally no lower than 1000 feet agl), and then increase the speed with flap retraction until initial climb speed and then final climb speed above FL 100.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If your first altitude restriction on departure is 4000 feet (which will be in the FMC) and VNAV is engaged you will level at 4000 feet. But, if prior to departure, you put 3000 feet in the altitude window (maybe as instructed by ATC) the aircraft will level at 3000 feet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If I remember correctly LNAV engages at 50 feet and VNAV engages at 400 feet agl. And, I may be mistaken, but I think that the auto-pilot could be engaged at 100 feet agl.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Now, I am probably wrong about this, but if you forget to set the altitude window to the first altitude in departure and leave it at 0 (which with some airlines the previous crew will do on shutdown) the following might possibly occur. At 50 feet LNAV engages, at 100 feet the autopilot engages, at 400 feet VNAV engages but as the altitude window is set to 0 the aircraft (on autopilot) now descends to capture 0 feet. The speed at this point in VNAV is low (max V2 + 20 kts) so, to maintain that, both thrust levers close. This, of course, would be totally unexpected and could have a startle effect. If you do not realise what has caused this you might think that there is a problem with the engines and you have very little time to deal with it. I would suggest that putting out a Mayday call at this stage is not a good use of time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As I stated at the beginning this is probably very unlikely and may not be possible, but could be tried in a simulator.

     It's fine that the \x93Enhanced Airborne Flight Recorders\x94 have 10 minutes battery backup. If the bits of equipment/sensors sending data to be recorded don't have power, you will be recording 10 minutes of silence/blank data.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The concept of powering 'critical (sensor) equipment' has been floated - the problem being that it
     <i>
      must
     </i>
     be possible to power down malfunctioning equipment in case of fire - real or suspected. Having independent power supplies and battery back-ups all around the airframe, each with an ability to lose their magic smoke, is a poor idea.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Commercial passenger jet aircraft already have robust power supplies with multiple generators and emergency battery support. However, if one malfunctions, rather than fails completely, it can be difficult to decide which one to disable, as it can cause problems in all systems.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  IIRC the CVR battery (in this case EAFR battery) is required to power at least the cockpit area microphone, if not the pilots' mics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Once the RAT deployed at least some data should have come back.

  This has been discussed upthread and has happened before (on a 777 IIRC) but did not result in a crash.

  It does not explain the RAT and generally you would expect crews to shove the thrust levers fully forward.

  Totally agreed. But at some point with the buildings coming into 8k definition, one would hope that a pilot experienced enough to be employed on a 787 would disconnect everything, firewall it and pull up the nose..

     BOEING, AIRBUS, MD, it doesn't matter, handles for Gear, Flaps different places, different shape. But it has happened and it will happen.....
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Ive seen it happen in a previous (ground based) life fairly frequently (in relative terms) but exclusively during descent/approach. Usually the context would be expecting a flap call but when the gear call is made the flap handle is moved and quickly returned to the previous gated position followed immediately by gear selection, confirmed upon review of the data. To happen on takeoff would be most unusual, and although the CCTV footage is indicative of it being highly plausible, neither pieces of footage really show anything to draw any conclusions on. Certainly there may be numerous aspects to this, perhaps there was some catastrophic electrical failure that wasn\x92t of itself an immediate threat to the flight but the startle effect in the flight deck prompted other reactions. It\x92s impossible to know based off the information available. The human element will form a significant part of the investigation regardless of root cause(s).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Regarding the comments about who should be allowed to comment on such threads. I like the fact the mods have taken a pragmatic view of this. Theres a reason many in the accident investigation field come from an engineering background. Whilst highly experienced pilots are clearly crucial on an SME level, there can be a tendency for iwouldnthavedoneitthatway-itis. This can at times hinder investigations where an open mind free from confirmation bias is essential.

  Gear possibly not selected up due to startle effect after a major event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bird strike unlikely to knock out both engines unless there is a flock of them, you might get a single bird into one engine but the odds of two birds each hitting separate engines are pretty long.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Aircraft often yaw slightly after takeoff, particularly with a crosswind which may be stronger in the air than on the ground.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Air India have had issues with pilot training and standards, reports not too long ago of Indian flight schools selling logbook hours which didn't involve any time in an aircraft.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Numerous reports of cabin maintenance issues with Air India, if they can't fix the seats and IFE possibly they can't fix other things.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  These days, high resolution cameras aren't prohibitively expensive and installing a few at airports would be better than mobile phone footage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wouldn't an incorrect altitude setting pitch the nose downwards and keep power on for the aircraft to accelerate ?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing philosophy is for the pilot to have ultimate control of the aircraft, Airbus try to protect the aircraft from pilot error. Inadvertent flap retraction on an Airbus will result in the slats remaining out and TOGA, which whilst not a guarantee, has saved a few necks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Possible issue with the particular type of engines fitted to that aircraft, even worse would be an aircraft issue which would have had the same result regardless of the engine manufacturer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The B787 has enough OEBs on it to fill up a small binder if printed out, some of which state that the issue is known about and the company is working on it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hopefully, given the time that the aircraft has been in service, it won't be a systemic problem suddenly coming to light in the way MCAS did on the B737 MAX relatively soon after EIS.

  It's starting to look more like a massive electrical or computer issue which resulted in both engines failing, the landing gear may have been left down longer than normal due to startle effect.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It could be maintenance related or a latent condition in the B787 which only occurred due to the required factors all being present on this occasion i.e. the holes in the Swiss cheese all lined up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing and Air India will be wanting to blame each other, hopefully having the UK AAIB involved will provide a balance as they don't have a dog in the fight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If this turns out to be another MCAS, it will be difficult for Boeing to continue in it's present form. The B787 has been beset with problems since its introduction, the B777X has had numerous issues during development and the B737 is overdue for replacement. Airlines are starting to drop Boeing due to quality, safety and delivery issues. China is on the rise and if the C919 proves itself, it might be the main alternative to the A320.

  For those sky gods who confidently state they would reset the cutoff switches immediately I would say that 10 seconds is not a particularly unusual time for startle effect to impair cognition, especially for something as monumental and unexpected as a dual engine failure at rotation. One reference amongst many:
  <a href="https://www.icao.int/Meetings/LOCI/Presentations/Managing%20Startle%20Individual%20Crew%20and%20Organizational%20Strategies.pdf" target="_blank">
   https://www.icao.int/Meetings/LOCI/P...Strategies.pdf
  </a>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And for those who scoff at the possibility of the PM inadvertently operating the cutoff switches (which is done as frequently as operating the gear lever), I\x92d remind you that more than one Airbus has landed with its parking brake on after the PM inadvertently set it rather than arming the spoilers.

     This is pure speculation but I can envision the following sequence of events that would match the timeline and the little we know from the CVR and sequence of events.

     - While PF is concentrated on flying the airplane, PNF moves the switches from RUN to CUTOFF in quick succession (for whatever reason).

  Sorry, stop right there.

  What reason would any 787 Training Captain have for doing that at rotation, or slightly after rotation?
