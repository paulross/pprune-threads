  Very sad day, let&rsquo;s hope that the investigation is thorough and lacking any &ldquo;political&rdquo; or &ldquo;cultural&rdquo; interference, the aircraft sounded very quiet to me on the video&hellip;but it&rsquo;s just a video, the DFDR and CVR should reveal all.

  Survivor and eye witness recollections can be very unreliable and need to be treated with caution. There is easy access to the flight data recorders so hopefully it won't be too long before a preliminary report is out. Boeing must be praying for the cause to be pilot error, after the way in which the company handled the crashes of the B737 MAX, the FAA won't be impressed with a video of the CEO flying onboard and telling everyone how safe the aircraft is. Anything aircraft related and you can guarantee a worldwide grounding of the type, they won't be flying while Boeing works on a software fix.

     I understand that the FDR has been recovered from the crashed 787.
     <br/>
     Could anyone tell me how many engine parameters are recorded and what is the sample rate.
     <br/>
     Thank you.
    </div>

  Most likely anything between 256 and 1024wps, individual parameters will vary with regards sample rate. Not au-fait with 787 but other Boeing aircraft
  <b>
   may
  </b>
  have dataframes relative to the original owner requirements (though this is unlikely to vary much given my experience with Boeing aircraft). I\x92m not sure if GE have a real time EHM feed like RR? Anyhow, and not wanting to speculate too much, if there was anything engine related it would certainly show up on the DFDR and GE could possibly even know that by now if they are equipped with real time health monitoring. In my opinion, for what it\x92s worth, the CCTV footage is consistent with flap retraction instead of gear, something that would also be easily identifiable upon review of the FDR which will be reported upon in due course.

  Having experience of many crash sites over a long career, taking off without flaps with the config horn/ warning blaring (or not if u/s) is a possibility Also selecting flaps up, instead of gear up at the positive rate of climb call, is also not unheard of and has happened. Both engines failing/ losing power at rotation/ initial climb out would be extremely rare, but not impossible. With the descent and lack of climb clear, unless a mistake of retracting flaps instead of gear, why wasn't the gear selected up as dragging that around is only going to end one way.
  <br/>
  he sound from the well documented video would suggest the engines were running, but were certainly not selected to TOGA/ full power which you might expect when faced with high buildings growing larger in the windshield.

  Due to the tail section being relatively intact, the CVR/ DFDR will be downloaded very soon, if not already, so we will all know shortly....

  The nose gear angle suggest that the "gear-up" was selected and a dual engine failure happened at the same time, with the hydraulics failing and possible RAT deployment.. The APU was not running and everything, except the flight recorders, might be powered down and restarted at a very low altitude.

  It's not surprising. The 787 was designed with a modern digital flight recorder (Enhanced Airborne Flight Recorder, EAFR). It does both - records data and voice. No more separation of CVR+FDR. Just one device.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the 787 was equipped with two redundant recorders. One in the aft, one in the front compartment. Both record identical data. If one of them was found in usable condition, then they're good. It will already have all the data they need.

     In fairness, recalling a "green light" is a pretty specific thing. A "sensation of thrust" from a seated passenger who may not even be an experienced flyer could be describing any feeling of movement or the illusion of same.

  Personally I don't hear much of the engines as the plane moves away from the cameraperson in the phone video, while the sound of impact is clearly discernible. If anyone can hear the engines well enough to tell if there is a significant change in their tone or volume, that would be valuable info, I think. Alternatively whatever increase in noise was heard started before the recording starts. In that case I suppose the "RAT theorists" would say it was the droning of the now-deployed RAT, with the assumption that it would be audible from inside the cabin (things like flap and landing gear actuation certainly are, so that isn't all that far-fetched). On the other hand, the "flap theorists" would probably say it was the crew firewalling the thrust levers in response to the inability to climb, which isn't far-fetched either.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Either way we will know soon enough what actions the pilots did or didn't take, since the various flight recorders should be found fairly easily in good condition.

  Good summary, I'd just say the thrust levers definitely weren't firewalled. The plane lost a huge amount of speed by impact. This single fact should be enough to end the flap retraction theory. It lost a huge amount of speed while descending - now what might cause that? The gear also begin the retraction process (bogies tilting). The obsession with flaps when there isn't a single piece of evidence for it is very odd. (not suggesting you are guilty of it btw).

     The recordings are simply of too low quality to draw any conclusions from.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     If it was dual engine failure shortly after rotation, that is very bad luck and I doubt any crew could recover from something like that.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I could speculate further but I think it\x92s just too hard to say without better quality footage or FDR data.

  Reports say that one of the black boxes have been recovered and the search continues for the other one. Apparently the B787 flight recorders log voice as well as data so only one is suffice if not damaged.

  As much as it's been interesting to read the many weird and wonderful theories, i think everyone should hold on, specially when making assumptions about the professional flight crew and maintenance engineers. The flight recorder readouts and flight deck voice recorder (whatever they are called on the 787) will 100% explain the events leading up to the tragedy. Hopefully the thorough investigations and findings will be transparent and lessons learned are immediately put in to effect.

     Indeed. All theories remain on the table until falsified - including the unpalatable ones. However, you may be overlooking Murphy's Law which tells us to expect this.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     To me, it makes sense to focus on testing out theories that fit within the ambit of Murphy's Law. There is no way of knowing which of us will turn out to be right. Possibly none of us...

  During the nearly two years that elapsed between AF 447 disappearing and the recovery of the flight data recorders nobody suggested that the PF might have, unwittingly, flown the aircraft, stalled, into the ocean.

  AI 171 may prove to also have a totally unpredicted cause.

  This was my thinking too. Extending this thinking, the technical aspect is generally quite predictable, the human element not so.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I\x92m absolutely not speculating this is the case here, but could you not achieve the effect this flight suffered by just switching off the fuel control switches at 100ft on takeoff?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There are now so many assumptions based on the assumed state of flap, RAT etc that it\x92s becoming pointless speculation.

     Has the rest of the fleet been grounded? If not they must have a fair idea of what caused this. And it is not something that is about to happen elsewhere.

  no groundings yet but we do not know for sure that there has been a successful readout of the DFDR. If it sustained damage or the interface electronics are non-functional, it\x92s not unusual for them to be taken to a secure lab at a *AIB where experts can attempt recovery using whatever advanced methods they have available. This may take time as they don\x92t want to lose data in rushing to extract it.
