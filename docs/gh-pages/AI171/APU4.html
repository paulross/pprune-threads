     Consensus here is, that both engines where stopped by a closing fuel cut off valve, wich yields a fast loss of N2. The generators then shut down very quick as does the thrust in a few seconds. This is supported by the quick RAT extension which allowed the crew to control the flight. The APU did autostart too. A thrust changed with the thrust leaver to idle is much slower and would not result in the dramatic change in performance. Thrust set to idle will not engage the RAT since the electric generators would still work. So a thrust leaver changed to idle or any intervention by Autothrust (AT) would not yield to the RAT extension. Something or someone activated a fuel cut off. How and why that happened is the big question, the investigators have to answer.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  A naive glider pilot question: if fuel cut off was (inconceivably) selected, would both fuel control levers have been flipped downwards from Run to Cutoff? And if they were then immediately flipped back to the Run position, how much time would have been needed to achieve enough thrust to maintain altitude?

     No, very unlikely the pilots lost all control. In a total power failure (hydraulics and electrics) the pilots can control roll (by a specific spoiler pair) and pitch through the stabiliser. All electrically powered through wiring direct to control column.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     It's possible the RAT was not providing correct power in the last moments, remember RAT provides Hydraulic (C system flight controls only) and Electrics. The evidence is the spoiler pair deflection behind the engines prior to impact. That specific spoiler pairing is only controlled by electrical power (directly connected to pilot control column). We should see other flight control deflections if the RAT was powering hydraulics. In the final moments I would speculate the flight controls had only emergency electric power from the battery.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  None of the flight controls can be powered by the battery. Both the stabilizer motors and the electrically-actuated spoilers require high-voltage DC which is only available with at least one engine-driven generator or APU generator working. They cannot be powered by the RAT generator either.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The direct wiring you're referring to is intended to provide minimal control in case of a complete failure of all ACEs. It allows for control signals but does not provide power.

  This incident is very perplexing to me. This is my first post on here and I am not a pilot. I have over a decade of experience in the RAAF as an engine fitter on Mirage and Hornet aircraft. Albeit a bit of time ago.
  <br/>
  I have watched the video's and looked at the FR-24 data a hundred times. To me it looks like a normal rotation and at WoW everything starts to go wrong.
  <br/>
  Airspeed starts dropping off immediately going by the FR-24 data. If reports are correct the pilot makes his Mayday call. FR-24 data stops.
  <br/>
  In the video from the balcony I agree the RAT is out and operating but I can also hear the engines at idle or just above (maybe flight idle).
  <br/>
  If the captain manually deployed the RAT this makes sense to me. In both video's I don't see any aircraft behavior that would suggest they are not flying the aircraft.
  <br/>
  Is there an electrical fault at WoW that renders the cockpit dark and therefore manually deploying the RAT (possibly initiating APU start, inlet door is open at crash site) would make sense to restore cockpit power.
  <br/>
  I can't understand any pilot shutting down both engines at 200ft AGL. He would surely know that his fight is over at that point.
  <br/>
  I am not ruling out pilot error (configuration or otherwise) but my hat goes off to two pilots that I believe were trying to fly this aircraft until it hit the ground.
  <br/>
  Sorry if my wording is a bit off but mine is military background not commercial.

     You may be surprised to know that TCMA doesn't require that, it just requires a differential between commanded and actual thrust.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     It has never triggered during takeoff until now. Maybe it still hasn't been. We'll see. Given there is an actual example of a 787 in the wild shutting down both of it's engines when it shouldn't (ANA), I'm surprised how complacent people are that this couldn't be the cause..Software can always have weird corner failures that could never have been thought of or tested.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Yes. I simplified. The point stands that the throttle needs to be pulled back, as it was in the ANA event, because that was a landing and not a take-off.

      A parallel is drawn to the ANA incident. However, this would require not only a fault in the air/ground logic but also a sensed discrepancy between T/L position (not necessarily idle) and thrust output on both engines simultaneously.

   First, you posted a good summary. I'd have added "unanticipated hardware fault" and "unanticipated software fault" as generic causes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Note that the thrust lever actuators are wired to the FADECs, and that the TCMA gets the T/L position from that. For TCMA to trigger, it has to determine that its FADEC (on that engine) failed to achieve a commanded reduction in thrust. So we're either looking at a weird, unprecedented edge case, or a FADEC failure, or both.

     Just so I have this clear, are you saying that the implementation of the TCMA functionality involved
     <b>
      no
     </b>
     new components being added to the pre-existing FADEC? Are you saying, in effect, that the two switch relays described in the TCMA patent application, which relays and their configuration achieves the described two channel redundancy, were already there as components or are mere depictions of what the software does itself?
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  It has been mentioned before that this capability existed as part of the N2 overspeed protection: the FADEC would shut down a runaway engine by cutting its fuel before it disintegrates.

     I am not suggesting you are wrong and, as I've said before, the descriptions and schematic in the patent application are just 'big hands / small maps' concepts. However, if TCMA functionality "is simply a bit of software in the FADECs", merely sending a 1 or 0 or other signal into a point in the pre-existing FADEC that already had control over fuel cutoff (with the TCMA software merely monitoring data busses, rather than direct sensor outputs, to work out thrust lever position and whether or not the aircraft is 'on the ground' for TCMA purposes) I for one would really like to know that for sure and get my head around the implications.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  The thrust lever sensors are wired directly to the FADEC (and hence the TCMA). No data bus is involved with this item.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With a MCAS crash, it required a hardware problem with an AOA sensor, used as input to a correctly working MCAS, to cause the aircraft to behave erratically. With a correctly working TCMA, I believe it'd require two hardware problems to get TCMA to shut down the engine, as there'd have to be an implausible thrust lever reading, and a FADEC/engine failure to process it within the TCMA allowed range ("contour"?). On both engines, separately and simultaneously.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That leaves a software problem; it's not hard to imagine. The issue is, at this point it's just that: imagination. I could detail a possible software failure chain, but without examining the actual code, it's impossible to verify. We simply don't have the evidence.
  <br/>
  I could just as well imagine a microwave gun frying the electronics on both engines. An escaped hamster under the floor peeing on important contacts. A timed device installed by a psychopathic mechanic. There's no evidence for that, either.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This process is a way to psychologically cope with the unexplained accident, but because it lacks evidence, it's not likely to identify the actual cause. We've run the evidence down to "most likely both engines failed or shut off close to rotation, and the cause for that is inside the aircraft". Since the take-off looked normal until that failure, we have no clues as to the cause hidden inside the aircraft. We need to rely on the official investigation to discover and analyse sufficient evidence. The post-crash fire is going to make that difficult.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <b>
   "Both engines failed or shut off close to rotation" explains all of the evidence
  </b>
  : it explains an unremarkable take-off roll, loss of lift, absence of pronounced yaw, loss of electrical power, loss of the ADS-B transponder, RAT deployment, the noise of the RAT banging into place and revving up, emergency signs lighting up, a possible mayday call reporting loss of thrust/power/lift, and a physically plausible glide from a little over 200 ft AAL to the crash site
  <strike>
   50 feet (?) below aerodrome elevation
  </strike>
  .
  <br/>
  It explains what we saw on the videos, what the witness reported, where the aircraft ended up, and the ensuing sudden catastrophe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I don't believe we have
  <i>
   evidence
  </i>
  for anything else right now&mdash;I'd be happily corrected on that.
  <br/>
  <br/>

  <br/>
  Edit: the evidence of the crash photo with the open APU inlet door, and the main gear bogeys tilted forward, are also explained by the dual engine failure/shut off.

  Great summary. I've already mentioned the first below, but I'd add another:
  <ul>
   <li>
    The existence (and timing) of the flyby video by a young lad who apparently lived where the footage was shot from. With planes flying past every few minutes, why would he choose to film this one, before he could even see it? The video starts with the plane still approaching, out of view, and his position suggests it was unplanned, before he could move to a better vantage point. I say he already knew it was extraordinary - from the sound.
   </li>
   <li>
    Eye witness account from the mother of the lad who filmed the flyby, apparently said that the plane was "shaking". I'll assume she didn't know how to describe it properly, and that maybe it sounded like it was shaking, from hearing the noise from the RAT.  Or it's a translation issue of a word/s with multiple meanings or used colloquially.
   </li>
  </ul>
  One question - are there two exterior doors to the APU compartment, one on top, one below, presumably inlet and outlet of cooling airflow? I've seen photos showing two open doors, but the lower one could be something else, and busted open during the crash.

     It&rsquo;s a possibility (as is virtually anything that doesn&rsquo;t break the laws of physics) but all the training, practicing and checking would have been to emphasise SOPs, which are to leave all the engine controls where they are until you have done a proper interactive diagnosis at a safe height with the flightpath assured.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Where the meme has come from that jet pilots have to shut down engines as quickly as possible I don&rsquo;t know but it is incorrect. If you left a failed engine without securing it for 5 minutes, little to no harm would come of it. Even if it was on fire (which is not necessarily flames, just higher than normal temperatures inside the nacelle) they are certified to be in this condition for some considerable time before it becomes a problem. Yes, I think the phrase &ldquo;without undue delay&rdquo; could be used for a fire indication but that&rsquo;s a minimum of 400&rsquo;AGL in Boeings and does not absolve you of all the cross-checking and CRM that should happen with an engine shutdown. This is practiced/checked at the least every 6 months in EASA land and any attempt to rush a shutdown at low level would lead to a debrief and more training/checking.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     To put it this way, control of the aeroplane and lateral/vertical navigation is far more important than doing stuff with a failed power plant. Something like an ET should be absolutely prioritised over engine drills.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  My airline emphasized no crew action for engine failure or fire until 1000 feet. At 400 feet we could only declare an emergency, request an alternate departure if needed and start the APU. It&rsquo;s far more important to fly the aircraft, get it properly trimmed and insure the proper engine out ground track is being flown. Only at 1000 feet would we begin the engine fire/failure checklist. Normally even that would come after the aircraft was cleaned up and stabilized. Best flying advice I ever got was in a severe emergency the first thing you should do is wind the clock!

  There is one air inlet door on the top right of the empenage. This is commanded open during APU start sequence and closes after APU shutdown.
  <br/>
  There are maintenance access doors directly belew the APU that open up like a Clamshell.
  <br/>
  There are other access doors nearby for example just forward of the APU firewall bulkhead there is an access door, this allows entry into the stabiliser bay rear section.
  <br/>
  There is another stab bay access door just forward of the horizontal stabiliser on the left side which allows access to the forward stabiliser area, screw jack, fin access and the rear pressure bulkhead.
  <br/>
  I don't think there are any others.

     The RIPS provides power to both the recorder and to the microphones in the cockpit.... If there's no power to the microphones, there is nothing to hear. If there's no power for systems in the aircraft.... then there's not going to be much for any recorder to record.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  If it has no power it won't record anything at all, like the fact that multiple electrical systems are U/S but as a limited power supply from the RAT or APU comes on-line it would have something to record. It seems to me absurd that it is not powered at all times.

     It has been said that there are three stages of truth: ridicule, violent opposition and acceptance as self-evident. Obviously, we're not there yet

     Of course the aircrew needs a lav within their easy reach. I don't have a cross section or plan to work with (Google not obliging), but if you post, I'll take a look. Likely, I'd compartmentalize the lav with the EE Bay space immediately below, and install a "bilge tray and drain" below the lav space and above the EE Bay compartment. If it
     <b>
      <i>
       has
      </i>
     </b>
     to be used for EE Bay gear, I'd probably rack the 28V Batteries there, with the required fireproof casings and exhaust ports etc. (Also absurd, but true.) And I'd make sure the batteries themselves were fully protected by moulded plastic "hats", similar to what they use on the big 12V battery pairs on large trucks. I guess you could fit a couple of TRUs there as well, again, well-protected from dripping conductive liquids... And maybe, you could house [one of?] the EE Bay air conditioner unit
     <strike>
      there? But none of the flight-critical board racks or other sensitive electronic equipment. Any moisture-related faults there would be just too random and difficult to pin down.
     </strike>
    </div>

  <br/>
  It will come as no surprise to anyone that EE bays are well protected with the sort of things you have described.
  <br/>
  The 787 batteries are also in separate EE bays. Main one in the front and the dedicated APU battery in the power electrics bay aft of the landing gear.
  <br/>
  They are both contained in fireproof boxes that will vent to atmosphere in the event of a thermal runaway.
  <br/>
  I have been working on 787s for over a decade and leaks from gallies and lavs has not once been on my list of snags.
