     Consensus here is, that both engines where stopped by a closing fuel cut off valve, wich yields a fast loss of N2. The generators then shut down very quick as does the thrust in a few seconds. This is supported by the quick RAT extension which allowed the crew to control the flight. The APU did autostart too. A thrust changed with the thrust leaver to idle is much slower and would not result in the dramatic change in performance. Thrust set to idle will not engage the RAT since the electric generators would still work. So a thrust leaver changed to idle or any intervention by Autothrust (AT) would not yield to the RAT extension. Something or someone activated a fuel cut off. How and why that happened is the big question, the investigators have to answer.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  A naive glider pilot question: if fuel cut off was (inconceivably) selected, would both fuel control levers have been flipped downwards from Run to Cutoff? And if they were then immediately flipped back to the Run position, how much time would have been needed to achieve enough thrust to maintain altitude?

     No, very unlikely the pilots lost all control. In a total power failure (hydraulics and electrics) the pilots can control roll (by a specific spoiler pair) and pitch through the stabiliser. All electrically powered through wiring direct to control column.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     It's possible the RAT was not providing correct power in the last moments, remember RAT provides Hydraulic (C system flight controls only) and Electrics. The evidence is the spoiler pair deflection behind the engines prior to impact. That specific spoiler pairing is only controlled by electrical power (directly connected to pilot control column). We should see other flight control deflections if the RAT was powering hydraulics. In the final moments I would speculate the flight controls had only emergency electric power from the battery.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  None of the flight controls can be powered by the battery. Both the stabilizer motors and the electrically-actuated spoilers require high-voltage DC which is only available with at least one engine-driven generator or APU generator working. They cannot be powered by the RAT generator either.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The direct wiring you're referring to is intended to provide minimal control in case of a complete failure of all ACEs. It allows for control signals but does not provide power.

  This incident is very perplexing to me. This is my first post on here and I am not a pilot. I have over a decade of experience in the RAAF as an engine fitter on Mirage and Hornet aircraft. Albeit a bit of time ago.
  <br/>
  I have watched the video's and looked at the FR-24 data a hundred times. To me it looks like a normal rotation and at WoW everything starts to go wrong.
  <br/>
  Airspeed starts dropping off immediately going by the FR-24 data. If reports are correct the pilot makes his Mayday call. FR-24 data stops.
  <br/>
  In the video from the balcony I agree the RAT is out and operating but I can also hear the engines at idle or just above (maybe flight idle).
  <br/>
  If the captain manually deployed the RAT this makes sense to me. In both video's I don't see any aircraft behavior that would suggest they are not flying the aircraft.
  <br/>
  Is there an electrical fault at WoW that renders the cockpit dark and therefore manually deploying the RAT (possibly initiating APU start, inlet door is open at crash site) would make sense to restore cockpit power.
  <br/>
  I can't understand any pilot shutting down both engines at 200ft AGL. He would surely know that his fight is over at that point.
  <br/>
  I am not ruling out pilot error (configuration or otherwise) but my hat goes off to two pilots that I believe were trying to fly this aircraft until it hit the ground.
  <br/>
  Sorry if my wording is a bit off but mine is military background not commercial.

     You may be surprised to know that TCMA doesn't require that, it just requires a differential between commanded and actual thrust.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     It has never triggered during takeoff until now. Maybe it still hasn't been. We'll see. Given there is an actual example of a 787 in the wild shutting down both of it's engines when it shouldn't (ANA), I'm surprised how complacent people are that this couldn't be the cause..Software can always have weird corner failures that could never have been thought of or tested.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Yes. I simplified. The point stands that the throttle needs to be pulled back, as it was in the ANA event, because that was a landing and not a take-off.

      A parallel is drawn to the ANA incident. However, this would require not only a fault in the air/ground logic but also a sensed discrepancy between T/L position (not necessarily idle) and thrust output on both engines simultaneously.

   First, you posted a good summary. I'd have added "unanticipated hardware fault" and "unanticipated software fault" as generic causes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Note that the thrust lever actuators are wired to the FADECs, and that the TCMA gets the T/L position from that. For TCMA to trigger, it has to determine that its FADEC (on that engine) failed to achieve a commanded reduction in thrust. So we're either looking at a weird, unprecedented edge case, or a FADEC failure, or both.

     Just so I have this clear, are you saying that the implementation of the TCMA functionality involved
     <b>
      no
     </b>
     new components being added to the pre-existing FADEC? Are you saying, in effect, that the two switch relays described in the TCMA patent application, which relays and their configuration achieves the described two channel redundancy, were already there as components or are mere depictions of what the software does itself?
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  It has been mentioned before that this capability existed as part of the N2 overspeed protection: the FADEC would shut down a runaway engine by cutting its fuel before it disintegrates.

     I am not suggesting you are wrong and, as I've said before, the descriptions and schematic in the patent application are just 'big hands / small maps' concepts. However, if TCMA functionality "is simply a bit of software in the FADECs", merely sending a 1 or 0 or other signal into a point in the pre-existing FADEC that already had control over fuel cutoff (with the TCMA software merely monitoring data busses, rather than direct sensor outputs, to work out thrust lever position and whether or not the aircraft is 'on the ground' for TCMA purposes) I for one would really like to know that for sure and get my head around the implications.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  The thrust lever sensors are wired directly to the FADEC (and hence the TCMA). No data bus is involved with this item.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With a MCAS crash, it required a hardware problem with an AOA sensor, used as input to a correctly working MCAS, to cause the aircraft to behave erratically. With a correctly working TCMA, I believe it'd require two hardware problems to get TCMA to shut down the engine, as there'd have to be an implausible thrust lever reading, and a FADEC/engine failure to process it within the TCMA allowed range ("contour"?). On both engines, separately and simultaneously.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That leaves a software problem; it's not hard to imagine. The issue is, at this point it's just that: imagination. I could detail a possible software failure chain, but without examining the actual code, it's impossible to verify. We simply don't have the evidence.
  <br/>
  I could just as well imagine a microwave gun frying the electronics on both engines. An escaped hamster under the floor peeing on important contacts. A timed device installed by a psychopathic mechanic. There's no evidence for that, either.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This process is a way to psychologically cope with the unexplained accident, but because it lacks evidence, it's not likely to identify the actual cause. We've run the evidence down to "most likely both engines failed or shut off close to rotation, and the cause for that is inside the aircraft". Since the take-off looked normal until that failure, we have no clues as to the cause hidden inside the aircraft. We need to rely on the official investigation to discover and analyse sufficient evidence. The post-crash fire is going to make that difficult.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <b>
   "Both engines failed or shut off close to rotation" explains all of the evidence
  </b>
  : it explains an unremarkable take-off roll, loss of lift, absence of pronounced yaw, loss of electrical power, loss of the ADS-B transponder, RAT deployment, the noise of the RAT banging into place and revving up, emergency signs lighting up, a possible mayday call reporting loss of thrust/power/lift, and a physically plausible glide from a little over 200 ft AAL to the crash site
  <strike>
   50 feet (?) below aerodrome elevation
  </strike>
  .
  <br/>
  It explains what we saw on the videos, what the witness reported, where the aircraft ended up, and the ensuing sudden catastrophe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I don't believe we have
  <i>
   evidence
  </i>
  for anything else right now&mdash;I'd be happily corrected on that.
  <br/>

  <br/>
  Edit: the evidence of the crash photo with the open APU inlet door, and the main gear bogeys tilted forward, are also explained by the dual engine failure/shut off.

      </li>
      <li>
       Unusual gear forward tilt position, suggestive of hydraulic failure and/or full electrics failure (one of the criteria for auto RAT deployment).
      </li>
      <li>
       Loss of all thrust, ie dual engine failure (one of the criteria for auto RAT deployment)

  Great summary. I've already mentioned the first below, but I'd add another:
  <ul>
   <li>
    The existence (and timing) of the flyby video by a young lad who apparently lived where the footage was shot from. With planes flying past every few minutes, why would he choose to film this one, before he could even see it? The video starts with the plane still approaching, out of view, and his position suggests it was unplanned, before he could move to a better vantage point. I say he already knew it was extraordinary - from the sound.
   </li>
   <li>
    Eye witness account from the mother of the lad who filmed the flyby, apparently said that the plane was "shaking". I'll assume she didn't know how to describe it properly, and that maybe it sounded like it was shaking, from hearing the noise from the RAT.  Or it's a translation issue of a word/s with multiple meanings or used colloquially.
   </li>
  </ul>
  One question - are there two exterior doors to the APU compartment, one on top, one below, presumably inlet and outlet of cooling airflow? I've seen photos showing two open doors, but the lower one could be something else, and busted open during the crash.

     It&rsquo;s a possibility (as is virtually anything that doesn&rsquo;t break the laws of physics) but all the training, practicing and checking would have been to emphasise SOPs, which are to leave all the engine controls where they are until you have done a proper interactive diagnosis at a safe height with the flightpath assured.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Where the meme has come from that jet pilots have to shut down engines as quickly as possible I don&rsquo;t know but it is incorrect. If you left a failed engine without securing it for 5 minutes, little to no harm would come of it. Even if it was on fire (which is not necessarily flames, just higher than normal temperatures inside the nacelle) they are certified to be in this condition for some considerable time before it becomes a problem. Yes, I think the phrase &ldquo;without undue delay&rdquo; could be used for a fire indication but that&rsquo;s a minimum of 400&rsquo;AGL in Boeings and does not absolve you of all the cross-checking and CRM that should happen with an engine shutdown. This is practiced/checked at the least every 6 months in EASA land and any attempt to rush a shutdown at low level would lead to a debrief and more training/checking.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     To put it this way, control of the aeroplane and lateral/vertical navigation is far more important than doing stuff with a failed power plant. Something like an ET should be absolutely prioritised over engine drills.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  My airline emphasized no crew action for engine failure or fire until 1000 feet. At 400 feet we could only declare an emergency, request an alternate departure if needed and start the APU. It&rsquo;s far more important to fly the aircraft, get it properly trimmed and insure the proper engine out ground track is being flown. Only at 1000 feet would we begin the engine fire/failure checklist. Normally even that would come after the aircraft was cleaned up and stabilized. Best flying advice I ever got was in a severe emergency the first thing you should do is wind the clock!

  There is one air inlet door on the top right of the empenage. This is commanded open during APU start sequence and closes after APU shutdown.
  <br/>
  There are maintenance access doors directly belew the APU that open up like a Clamshell.
  <br/>
  There are other access doors nearby for example just forward of the APU firewall bulkhead there is an access door, this allows entry into the stabiliser bay rear section.
  <br/>
  There is another stab bay access door just forward of the horizontal stabiliser on the left side which allows access to the forward stabiliser area, screw jack, fin access and the rear pressure bulkhead.
  <br/>
  I don't think there are any others.

     The RIPS provides power to both the recorder and to the microphones in the cockpit.... If there's no power to the microphones, there is nothing to hear. If there's no power for systems in the aircraft.... then there's not going to be much for any recorder to record.
    </div>

  If it has no power it won't record anything at all, like the fact that multiple electrical systems are U/S but as a limited power supply from the RAT or APU comes on-line it would have something to record. It seems to me absurd that it is not powered at all times.

     But at this point it&rsquo;s wayyyyyyy too early to do any Boeing Bashing based on an accident none of us have any clue as to the cause.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Indian media has been reporting all week that the DGCA said only 24 of Air India's 33 Boeing 787 aircraft had passed an "enhanced safety inspection" it had ordered the airline to carry out. What this actually means is one third of the 787 fleet didn't pass safety inspections. 7 were in fact grounded. Possible incompetency in maintenance, or/and maintenance that is increasingly required due to incompetency in design, manufacturing and inferior components, for reasons I&rsquo;ll explain further down.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Even before the crash, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) had warned Air India of multiple safety protocol violations after three of its planes continued operations despite pending security checks of emergency systems. This warning was issued days before the Ahmedabad Air India Plane crash. In one case an AI plane flew to destinations such as Dubai, Riyhad and Qatar despite a 1 month delay in carrying out mandatory inspections. Indian Media has reported numerous instances of AI planes failing Pre-flight inspections and Daily/Turnaround inspections that are crucial before every flight, and still flying.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In fact, Air India has long suffered from numerous technical failures, creaky aircraft and demoralised staff, even before the disastrous crash, and certainly since.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On 10th March:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - AI125 (Chicago to Dehli) was forced to turn around after 5 hours
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On 16th June:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - Al315 (Hong Kong to Delhi) returned to base due to technical snags that the pilots decided weren&rsquo;t safe to fly with
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - Al9695 (Delhi to Ranchi) returned to base due to technical snags that the pilots decided weren&rsquo;t safe to fly with
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - A BA Boeing 787 was forced to turn back to London
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On 17th June:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - Al159, the rebranded Al171, was cancelled due to the replacement aircraft being unavailable due to technical trouble
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - Al180 from San Francisco to Mumbai was grounded in Kolkata due to engine trouble.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On 20th June:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - 8 AI flight routes (4 international, 4 domestic) have been cancelled due to failing safety checks imposed after Ahmedabad crash
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - 15% of all AI international flights have been cancelled until at least mid July
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Problems are reported in Indian media to be deep and structural. From Indian bureaucracy (Babudom), prevalent in both public, ex public and recently privatised sectors, poor work ethics, an &ldquo;it will do&rdquo; (chalta hai) culture, bullying and hierarchical workplace, to paying lip service to maintenance and health and safety. Indian media has reported grave safety concerns surfacing within Air India, with whistleblowers accusing the airline of negligence and misconduct. Captain Sivaran was sacked for raising safety issues, after refusing to fly illegally with issues that compromised passenger safety, including emergency oxygen deployment not passing safety tests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Previously Government owned, Air India was privatised and taken over by Tata, who are notorious for cost cutting and infamous for poor health and safety records. Indian media have reported that the Engineering department responsible for maintenance and passing technical inspections had their salary frozen despite rampant inflation, had staff cut, and had all their benefits removed. Many workers have apparently (according to my Indian friends) more or less given up on their work, and were just passing the documents because they had neither the manpower nor the time to do them, and were under intense pressure by management to pass them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Air India had a Turkish contractor at Ahmedabad to maintain their widebodies, which they abruptly dropped around 2 weeks ago, apparently because Turkey refused to ditch its cordial relations with Pakistan. Who took this contract over and what capacity they had to do so is unclear because AI have so far refused to comment or answer questions specifically on this.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the meantime, Tata have been serving defamation lawsuits in India on any news organisation that dares to criticise them for anything. They have a long history of doing this.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It&rsquo;s important to note that all this is happening while 53% of posts at the DGCA remain vacant, along with 35% of posts at the bureau of civil aviation security and 17% of posts at the airports authority of India.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite all this, the Indian PM Modi has a very aggressive target of reaching 240mn air passengers annually by the end of this year, rising to 500mn by 2030, and a tripling of cargo capacity from 3.5 million metric tonnes by the end of this year to 10 million metric tonnes. This is merely exacerbating the problems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And then there&rsquo;s the plane type itself. The 787-8 has 9 Technical safety issues per million Flight hours. Technical safety issues are faults that comprise the safe operation of the flight. The A350, by contrast, has 0.3 Technical safety issues per million Flight hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the 787, this equates to 3.8 technical diversions per 100 aircraft annually. For the A350, it equates to 0.13 technical diversions per 100 aircraft annually, or 1 technical diversion every 8 years across 100 aircraft. Examining publicly available Airline Performance Reliability Metrics, we can see much less of a variance with the A350 across airlines when compared to 787-8 across airlines and tiers, and a much lower rate of faults by factors of 50-100.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The A350 design is maintenance friendly, meaning the plane is reliable independent of operator tier. The 787-8 design is exposed to quality of maintenance. Boeing planes have an uncomfortably high rate of background faults meaning they need to rely on the redundant systems far more often than their competitors such as Airbus. Despite the 737 Max crashes we continue to see Boeing planes experience much higher levels of system faults and failures in its flagship products. This level of acceptance of systemic failures leaning on the redundant systems for normal operation creates situations where multiple catastrophic failures are increasingly possible.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  You might think the above data could be biased by the battery issues that plagued Dreamliners early on, and led to them being grounded for a short period. However, if you examine the data, rather than seeing lower issues we see continual concerning noise of similar peaks, with higher rates in recent years, even after the battery issues were apparently addressed in 2013. So the 787-8 has a noisy gremlin baseline of issues - something we don't see in the Airbus products. If we dig into the public data, we can see that the vast majority of these issues are engine and electrical related. Not a shock in itself, given the heavy electrical design of the plane. Thanks to the testimony of Boeing whistleblower Sam Salehpour, we know that Boeing used improper techniques to ground electrical systems on the 787. This can lead to arcing, overheating, and potential fire hazards&mdash;all of which we&rsquo;ve seen cause problems on multiple occasions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It doesn't seem to matter which engine type is installed, the Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 or GE GenX1B, by the way. When normalised for fleet distribution, both variants show around 2.5 events per million flight hours. That strongly suggests the problem isn't engine related. It's the integration between the engines and the 787s electrical architecture.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  We know that various electrical systems on this particular plane were non operational, and that an ex crew member has said that this plane had long been plagued with electrical issues. I&rsquo;ve heard lots of people say that this doesn&rsquo;t matter, because they&rsquo;re on separate systems to the engines due to redundancy, so it&rsquo;s ok. But that&rsquo;s not strictly true, once you understand how the redundancy works. What it effectively means you&rsquo;ve removed a layer of redundancy, and you are relying on that redundancy just to be able to fly normally. This means that the Swiss cheese already has two or more holes lined up, and your redundancy is no longer as deep.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Redundant systems exist to catch rare failures. 1 in a million anomalies that slip through every other safeguard. They are meant to back up a reliable system, not compensate for frequent faults. Planes should not be designed to run frequently on redundancy. In aviation you evaluate a highly redundant yet failure-prone aircraft not just on whether it stays aloft, but on reliability and maintainability metrics, such as meantime between failures, Technical safety issues per million Flight hours, and other airline performance metrics, almost all of which the 787, and other Boeing planes, have a far higher rate of than their Airbus competitors. No one should be accepting multiple faults as okay simply because redundancies are there to protect the passengers. And yet that appears to be the case in the 787-8.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Compact Air Compressors (CAC) are 4 individual units. Their role isn't just passenger comfort. They regulate cabin pressure, temperature and cool down key electrical systems, which is critical. With nearly a megawatt of electricity flowing through the aircraft, heat becomes a serious issue. If it isn't dissipated properly, it can cause component degradation, arcing or even shutdowns&mdash;sound familiar?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  DC behaviour can be unstable. Arcing that doesn't want to stop. Arcing and insulation isn&rsquo;t always a good combination. Insulation materials do not like heat, and arcs produce a lot of it in very short time frames. If you are short-circuiting a fine signal wire with a thick power transmission cable (like the supply for entertainment system), there's no fuse or circuit breaker designed to protect this fine wire. The fine wire may become a fuse. This means the wire, for its full length, may change its state from solid to plasma. As this wire is not protected inside a low pressure glas cylinder like a real fuse, the insulation will become a mix of solid, liquid, gas and plasma. Neighbouring insulation probably too. We know a cable can overheat and melt the insulation of two redundant sensors at the same time. The SA 111 fire was due to arcing in a faulty entertainment system (sound familiar?). All this wiring from all these redundant systems comes together in some places to the same devices, such as the display showing the pilots the engine parameters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Let&rsquo;s say a single Variable Speed Frequency Generator (VSFGs) fails and the system isolates it. The Generator Control Breaker (GCB) opens, cutting the failure fail generator off from the 235 volt BUS. The BUS Power Control Units (BPCU) are in charge of parcelling DC distribution, which enable BUS isolation and linking BUSes together. Power is automatically rerouted via BUS Tie Breakers (BTBs) and the remaining three generators, or the Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) if needed, to pick up the load. The Electrical Load Management System (ELMS) may shed non-essential loads like galley ovens, inflight entertainment and passenger AC, but primary flight systems stay online. Sound familiar?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The crew sees an alert but there's no loss of function. Pressurisation, flight controls, anti-ice etc. all continue uninterrupted. If both generators on one side go down, it&rsquo;s serious. The entire sides 235VT AC BUS drops. In response the right side generators and/or reroute power across the backup BUS path via isolation relays. If the APU isn't available, the Ram Air Turbine (RAT) deploys, automatically feeding emergency power into the system. The switch happens in under a second, quick enough to avoid flight critical interruptions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If a CAC overheats, over speeds, or loses turbo pressure, the system shuts it down. The opposite side CAC kicks in automatically to handle cabin pressurisation and thermal loads, and the ELMS adjusts the outflow valves or reduces pack flow as needed. Passengers may notice a shift in cabin temperature or pressure but no immediate safety is compromised.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In rarer cases, where both CACs on one side fail, that side's Environmental Control System (ECS) goes offline. ELMS quickly boosts output from the remaining side to stabilise conditions. Anti-ice and other systems may be throttled back to preserve cabin integrity. Climb or descent rates might slow but again the plane keeps flying. If both engine generators fail mid-flight the RAT deploys within seconds. It starts delivering around 30 kilovolt amps, just enough to keep the backup BUS, CACs and Transformer Rectifier Units (TCU)s alive. Once the Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) spins up and takes over, the RAT retracts automatically. That transition typically takes about 1 to 2 minutes&mdash; not ideal but survivable, given enough altitude. But more flight critical electrical systems potentially aren&rsquo;t being cooled enough. The holes in the Swiss cheese are being aligned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On paper Boeing's electrical power architecture should never cascade into a total failure. Cross ties, smart load shedding, redundant processes and trip curves all exist to stop one fault from spiralling into another. Yet there is at least 1 constant risk: Simultaneous Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC) Protect Idle. Basically it&rsquo;s the equipment of &ldquo;limp home" mode in a car ECU.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  FADEC is the electronic engine control computer. In certain DC side faults both FADECs, one to each engine, can perceive a loss of power, and command engines into protect idle. This flight idle schedule is 25 to 30% of N1, which I believe is about 8% of max thrust, designed to protect against over speed or surge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Taken together the apparently most probable sequence - the RAT deploying, the engines spooling to idle, an inability to retract the gear - could be explained by an edge case - a full AC generation failure followed by a brief 28 volt DC sag tripping both Direct Memory Access (DMA) and DC channels on each FADEC, and forcing protect idle fuel schedules mid-takeoff.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This could be from any number of electrical issues, such a transient high load sag - during a hot day, a high power event, gear retraction, avionics peak loads etc. The chances of this are of course exacerbated if one or more VSFG LS or CACS are already out, as seems plausible in this case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Perhaps someone can help me here please? I believe the monitoring systems on a Boeing 787 sample the electrical system voltages and currents at a relatively high frequency. This gives the potential to over-react to a transient event by taking immediate action instead of waiting a short time before re-sampling again. There is the possibility of the Bus Tie Contactor (BTC) closing, something fairly fundamental to the electrical system. The 787 uses variable frequency AC generators whose outputs are rectified and then inverted to other AC voltages and high DC voltages, some in the 250-300V region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The DC BUS voltage could drop below the under voltage threshold. At same time the engine's DMA's output can sag; it&rsquo;s rectifier sees too low an AC input, so both channel A and channel B sense a low voltage. Alternatively, a shared harness or ground fault, to two sensing circuits that share a common power quality filter and grounding path in the Forward equipment bay. In this case, a single heavy chafe, splice failure, or melted connector, upstream of both sense lines, can remove the sense reference for both channels, making them think the voltage dropped out. Another possibility is a solid state controller reset; a VSFG contactor arc, or a Transient Rectifier Unit (TRU) can momentarily reset the upstream power converters. If both the DMAs built-in rectifier and TRU's electronics are held in reset by the same transient, for example by a very big VSFG arc, both channels will indicate loss until the converters restart. Yet another possibility is water damage, or a lithium battery fire damage (sound familiar?) in an electrical connector, for example shorting the 28V DC BUS for the Electronic Throttle System (ETS) which controls thrust, which means it can&rsquo;t talk to the FADEC, prompting Protect Idle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Does anyone know how Boeing, Regulators and/or Airline test electrical/computer interactions in the 787 involving arcing/shorting voltage/current transient testing across and upstream from FADEC? The Electronic Engine Controls (EECs) and FADECs in the engines are self-powered via magnetos and self-controlling in many circumstances, but perhaps something like the above occurred, due to the effect of electrical transients on the various signals received by the EECs. The code in FDACs is only made to cover problems the programmers have thought of and are testable.
  <br/>

  You can detect a non-fictional sensor (such as a broken wire) or one where there are the two signal wires short circuiting each other, because both scenarios deliver known values. But if, for example, an analogue sensor outputting a specific voltage on a specific value like engine core temperature (say 1V on 50 degrees, 8V on 500 degrees, 12V on 1000 degrees) and you shortcut two sensors at the same time with a power supply wire, that delivers stable 12V, the input will read for both computers a plausible vale of 1000 degrees, a overheating engine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Of all these, the most likely scenario is still a real dual sag: a momentary high demand spike that drags both the DMA AC output and the 28vt DC BUS below their thresholds for long enough&mdash;approximately 200 to 300 milliseconds&mdash;that the BPCUs see it as a true loss of both channels. The RAT automatically deploys in under two seconds when both main AC buses drop. I believe someone here has already asked the question of how aircraft engines might react to a transient power fault. With engines idle, I believe hydraulic electric pumps lose their power so the crew couldn't retract the gear.

  IMO, the available information about the aircraft type and it&rsquo;s past and current issues, the individual aircraft itself and it&rsquo;s past issues, and the airline and airport and their issues, point towards an extreme Swiss cheese alignment of electrical faults in hot and humid high power conditions, possibly causing a software glitch, potentially exacerbated by poor maintenance and design/manufacturing. This catastrophic electrical anomaly may have forced both FADECS into protect idle producing the observed flight profile.

  <br/>
  The background noise of gremlins in a 787's electrical and engine systems is concerning. When your platform accumulates sporadic faults the probability, however minor, of a full electrical collapse is no longer zero. Continually relying on redundancy systems for operational flight massively increases the risk.
