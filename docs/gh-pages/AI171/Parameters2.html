     I am not certain on that. Remember the 737 didn't have them on the standby bus (Jeju). The NTSB doc states they're powered from the L/R 28VDC buses on the 787.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     This shows the centre TRUs can only power the instrument buses not the L/R DC buses, the RAT can't really power the right TRU without powering both R1/R2 buses, and powering the left TRU would require powering the left 235/115 ATU which would probably be a lot of magnetising current even if not much actual load. The contactor naming supports that.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     My money is on the L/R DC buses being unpowered in RAT operation; only the CA/FO instrument buses and the 235VAC backup bus.

  . There's potentially a wealth of data concerning a to me at least surprisingly number of 2000 of parameters written on a 787 EAFR, that is that at least if there's elec power. Even the 10 min RIPS is useless if there's no data sent from electrically shut off systems.

  The requirements I have seen indicate that RIPS is applicable only to CVR or the CVR function of an EAFD.  If you are aware of any requirement for RIPS to support flight data recording would you please provide a reference.

  By the time you're down to EMER GEN you usually know what the problem is and most systems with parameters that could be recorded on the FDR are unpowered so what's the point of trying. The CVR with a RIPS at least helps us to try understand how or why the events to regain control after that failed.

  If rigorously applied, an "engine thrust balancer" would cause the good engine to fail if something happened to the other one. Surely there is some logic in there somewhere to give up and disconnect past a certain amount of adjustment??

  Thank you for that answer, edge cases do abound in complex systems, but would not moving the throttles forward by hand (as the thrust was beginning to reduce {for that strange reason}) overcome that and restore thrust?
  <br/>
  (As I don't fly the 787, I may be missing something basic on how the systems work).

  The FCOM explains that the system only operates when there is a large thrust to weight ratio and will maintain the required climb performance. If applied during an engine out, it will provide directional control only when airspeed drops below normal operating speeds.

  In this case, there is still an AU - it's just integrated into the EAFR.

  Again, you can not conclude that from the report.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Different inputs are sampled at different rates. Some very basic info here:
  <a href="https://scaledanalytics.com/2023/04/25/arinc-767-or-what-do-you-mean-my-b787-uses-767-data/" target="_blank">
   https://scaledanalytics.com/2023/04/...uses-767-data/
  </a>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's highly likely switch positions are only sampled at 1Hz, and not at 100 Hz. For engine parameters you'll likely want a higher sample rate, as the whole engine could go from perfectly fine to exploded in less than a second.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If you had something like:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  08:08:42.96 UTC: cut off switch 1
  <br/>
  08:08:43.01 UTC: cut off switch 2
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It would likely be recorded as:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  08:08:42 UTC: cut off switch 1
  <br/>
  08:08:43 UTC: cut off switch 2
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leading you to believe there was one second between these 2 actions, whereas it was actually only 50ms.

  OK, a couple of informed comments, again with the disclaimer that I have very little first hand knowledge of the 787.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Every single engine parameter I've seen on a DFDR readout has been recorded at 1/second (most parameters), or slower. I've never seen an engine parameter recorded at more than once/second.
  <br/>
  The recorder doesn't do an instantaneous snapshot - it cycles through the thousands of recorded parameters. So a once second difference on the data could - in reality - be anywhere from 0.01 seconds to 1.99 seconds. If it matters, a deep dive into the avionics and FDR logic could narrow that time interval down. That being said, moving both switches to cutoff could happen in about a second. The switches make a rather distinct noise (especially if moved rapidly) so the CVR should give better resolution.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There have been instances in the past where the locking tab on the switch has been broken or 'worn down' from heavy use. But that's been seen on
  <i>
   very
  </i>
  high cycle aircraft - usually 737s that fly short hops. No memory of ever hearing of an issue with relatively new 787s that are - by nature - long range aircraft and don't get a lot of cycles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the 747-400, the fuel switches are a 'break before make' design with a distinct gap of ~0.050 seconds during a normal switch cycle (it's a long, somewhat painful story about why I know that...). I don't know the specifics of the 787, but I'd be very surprised if it's any different.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  BTW, if the investigators had reason to believe the switches somehow moved on their own, I think a fleet wide inspection would have been ordered by now.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I keep coming back to my 'muscle memory' hypothesis...

  Speculation is naturally going in a particular direction towards deliberate action, but it gives me some pause as to whether this actually makes sense as a pre-meditated scheme, and I don't know either way.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Now, perhaps this is a question that shouldn't actually be answered for various good reasons, so more a prompt to consider, but if you were going to set about doing this intentionally, is the probability of the desired outcome actually high enough to commit to this specific course of action, out of all the possibilities available? Perhaps not in this specific environment, but modern survivability in relatively low energy accidents is remarkably high.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In this incident, prior to the release of the report, we have previously remarked that the crew seemed to have done the best they could with it and got unlucky with the circumstances - the buildings, essentially. For me that also raises a question of how carefully planned &amp; rehearsed such a plan would have to be - the breadth of timing parameters where this would 'work' or not.&ZeroWidthSpace;&ZeroWidthSpace;&ZeroWidthSpace;
