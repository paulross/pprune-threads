     I'm sorry but pilots are taught to recognise lack of acceleration during takeoff. They're also taught about cross checking FMC entries during setup. How are they taught? By me and many others.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Even if the pilots had the wrong FMC performance, it would be noticed in the before takeoff cxl.

  Firstly, condolences to all those involved.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Secondly the above is a load of rubbish, as someone who also 'trains and checks' pilots and also has many years of Safety Investigation within large airlines it is a semi regular occurrence to depart with incorrect or no data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tiger took off in Sydney with NO data in the FMGC,
  <br/>
  Singapore had a tail strike in AKL after inserting the ZFW as the TOW
  <br/>
  Emirates almost crashed in MEL for similar reasons.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Not saying that this happened here
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Air NZ a few years ago almost put a 787 in the water out of Rarotonga as they had 100' in the FCU, took off, engaged autopilot and the aircraft pitched down and thrust came off, pilots recovered it at 60agl.
  <br/>
  Emirates has done similar, so these things happen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Clearly we don't know what happened here but I think it fair to assume it went wrong at rotate given the gear stayed down which would suggest a distraction at that point.

     Air NZ was a B777, but your point is valid.

     Off thread but posted for accuracy to comment made

     You chaps not actually referring to the erroneous 767 ILS approach at Faleolo?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The airline won numerous awards for its world wide promotion of the incident and lessons to be learnt, produced a video available on Y'tube as "NZ60 Erroneous ILS Incident, Apia"
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Citation by New Zealand Air Line Pilots Association
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Official report, rvs-bi-de/publications/compendium/incidents_and_accidents/CAA_occurrence_report_00_2518.pdf
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  <br/>
  Nope, not referring to that one, this was a 777 Departure out of Raro that came very close to impacting the water. No report ever released as the CAA deemed the operator to have dealt with it through their safety channels. This was the ONLY press it got.

  From the report it is clear that the switches were selected to cut off, we will likely NEVER know why, maybe the CVR gives a few more clues but we will never know if it was an intentional or accidental act. What is clear is that during rotation you are never fiddling with bags etc.
