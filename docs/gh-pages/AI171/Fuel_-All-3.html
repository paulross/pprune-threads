     Media translated what the survivor said as thrust was added prior to impact but a more correct translation is he said the engines revved or accelerated just prior to impact.

  If this is correct, does it point more towards the engines having been erroneously shut down earlier, rather than a fuel starvation or contamination issue?

      The takeoff run was from the full length and appeared normal, even after comparing with the same flight on previous days. This very much reduces the likelihood of it being a performance issue, e.g. wrong flaps, derate, ZFW/TOW, etc.

     <span style="color:#000000">
      Shortly after takeoff, the gear started retracting but stopped in an early intermediate position. At the same time the aircraft climb rate dropped off, then it started a shallow descent. This is consistent with a loss of electrical power causing a loss of hydraulic pressure and total engine thrust from both engines reducing below that generated by one engine at the takeoff setting. The position reporting also went offline at that moment, indicating that it was likely load shed due to an electrical malfunction

  Hello all,
  <br/>
  I personally think this is a good summary of what we can ascertain at this point from the evidence we have.
  <br/>
  I am not a 787 driver by any means but with a fair bit of aviation experience. I would be interested in any thoughts on this suggestion regarding loss of thrust:
  <br/>
  If we take it as a reasonable assumption as above that it is almost simultaneous loss of significant thrust, and for the good reasons already discussed, it is pretty unlikely that from what we can see/analyse, that the cause of this would be bird strike (expect to see some signs on video if it's significant enough to cause double engine failure) nor fuel contamination (reasons as above re: likelihood, other ac affected and simultaneous nature). TCMA I don't know enough about but it seems that the sensor redundancy/logic protection is so high it would not be the sole cause.
  <br/>
  On this basis, should we perhaps consider the causality of a total electrics failure of some kind first, leading to deployment of the RAT, gear retraction cease etc. Clearly the independent FADEC power generation systems would mean this doesn't on its own prevent thrust control of the engines but could we then be looking at cascading faults (possibly exacerbated by latent faults below the MEL/defect threshold) that contribute to dual power loss and sensor/system issues in throttle response not resulting in FADEC commands to the engines to increase thrust. So even at that point 'firewalling' the throttles could tragically not recover the situation?
  <br/>
  Very happy to be corrected by those with much more experience and understanding of big jets operations and systems!

  Having looked at the photos of the wings, one wing appears to have flaps and slats, the other does not.

  this could be from post impact damage, but an interesting observation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From what I can see so far, there is an electrical event that occurs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  but why and how that causes an aircraft to crash, is to be determined.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is either going to be a very quick or very long investigation, no in-between.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  My gut instinct is this is going to be a previously unexpected or unplanned failure that, whilst there was redundancy (expected) it took it all out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  although a totally unrelated incident, it reminds me of the LHR 777 with the fuel pump heaters being designed to stop ice getting into the lines. But on that exact day, conditions and variables, the very system designed to mitigate said problems, became the problem.

     Even though there is no point speculating about the cause of this accident, it is the nature of the beast to have questions. As pilots (most of us at least), we do have an inquiring mindset.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     My initial thoughts were an inadvertent flap retraction. But with the &lsquo;evidence&rsquo; that has been presented over the last 48 hours, I think we can safely discard that option.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     What we think we know is:
     <br/>
     - RAT was deployed (highly possible)
     <br/>
     - Gear was selected up, but did not operate (bogey tilted, doors remained closed)
     <br/>
     - APU was &lsquo;on&rsquo; (APU door open on after crash pictures)
     <br/>
     - Flight path
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Any of these observations, alone, would mean very little. However, in combination, they all point to a dual engine flameout just at/after the rotation. The aircaft has enough kinetic energy to reach roughly 150ft altitude, end then starts a shallow descent at &lsquo;alpha max&rsquo; into the buildings ahead. The RAT deployed, APU attempted auto-start, gear was unable to retract.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I only wonder why the engines spooled down. Bird strike seems to be out of the question, so that leaves us with only a very few options, which include a software bug or a suicidal pilot (not a popular option, I understand, but we have to take all options into account).
     <br/>
     <br/>
     What I don&rsquo;t believe is incorrect FCU selections, since that would not explain the high AOA on impact. It also would not explain the RAT, no gear retraction or the APU inlet flap open. Another thing that is highly unlikely is any switching done by the pilots, especially RAT etc.. These airborne time is just too little, pilots usually don&rsquo;t take any action below approximately 400ft, and these switches are so &lsquo;underused&rsquo; that a pilot would not find them instantaneously in a high stress situation.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     For me, a dual engine flameout seems the only possible explanation, now we only have to wait for its cause.

  I asked this yesterday, and was told no. You have to pull them out before you can move them up or down. So you can't operate them if, say, your hand slips violently off the throttle lever and drops down into the switches.

     My next question, again I believe not discussed, is what do the 787 Fuel Cutoff switches actually do? Obviously, they cut off the fuel supplies to the engines - pretty important in engine fire and other scenarios, but goes without saying. The real question is, what do they activate (or deactivate)? I'm assuming a simple solenoid valve, which is open when powered and closed when unpowered, but of course, there will (certainly) be Electro-Mechanical or Solid-State (Electronic) relays between the switches and the (solenoid valves).
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I guess the next obvious question is, is there anything else that can turn off those Fuel Cutoff Valves - a computer condition for example. I'm assuming not, but I think it needs to be considered.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Taking each switch individually, next, since this is part of an electrical circuit, and of necessity must include Electrical Relays, there is certainly at least one and in all probability two electric Power Sources involved in this circuit. One supply which passes through the switch to activate the relay, and, I'm assuming, a second, higher current and probably higher voltage supply which drives the (solenoid?) valve.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     As I see it, interrupting either supply will have the same effect - if the system is wired in the Positive-Postive sense, meaning a current through the switch causes the relay to pass a current through the (solenoid). If either of these supplies is cut, the Fuel Shutoffs will shut off the fuel. So, the question is, where do these supplies come from, and under what circumstances could they be cut off?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Sure, it looks to some (myself included) like a near simultaneous cutoff of both engines, but that doesn't have to have been caused by either of the pilots. I know there is huge redundancy built into the 787 Electrical Systems, but some of the evidence is suggesting that there was something not right with the plane's electrical system. I'm also fairly sure that there will be parts and places where certain faults can take the system down, despite the redundancy. I can't say where, but it's very difficult to design a perfect system, especially where there has to be transfers between multiple potential supplies and single actuators, motors or valves.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Having spent years repairing electrical and electronic systems, I know that the most difficult of all electrical faults are the intermittent ones. And I suspect that this is at the root of this crash. An intermittent or faulty AOA sensor has "caused" (provoked) multiple famous crashes... Can't find the one I'm looking for (pre-1980, I think) as the Max AOA issues dominate.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I can cite a very personal example, which involved the electrical supply to my house. I had several computers running 24x365 so of course, ran them off a UPS, which turned out to be a very good thing. I started to notice that at certain times, the UPS would activate - it would cut in and take over the computer loads, its alarm would go off to indicate a power fault. But the power was still on! This carried on for weeks and I initially blamed the UPS. Then, I noticed that it only happened on very hot afternoons... Long story short, the fault was caused by an electrical linesman, probably 30 years earlier, failing to tighten up a joint clamp on the phase wire to our house, across the street. Heating caused expansion then movement, and the power would momentarily go off then back on, and the UPS detected this. I note that this crash was on a hot day, and maybe this plane (which I believe was repositioned for the flight), had not been operating in such high temperatures recently, meaning the problem went unnoticed.

  On a typical Boeing, fuel cutoff switch would be engine shutoff command, engine FMU valve shutoff (sometimes integrated into an engine overspeed protection system), airplane spar fuel valve and ignition exciter power.

  A question for B787 pilots or mechanics.
  <br/>
  Is it correct to assume that the EFSOV valves are actuated by the fuel flow and controlled by an electric signal coming directly from the relevant EEC. Meaning that the simultaneous closing of the 2 valves would require an improbable simultaneous failure of the 2 EEC, or that the 2 fuel switches are flipped from "run" to "cut-off" at almost the same time, feeding the same command to the 2 EEC.
  <br/>
  And that the spar fuel valves are electrically actuated with the power coming from the hot battery bus and the signal coming from the aft electronic bay (possibly from the same control unit)?

     Combining all the bits and pieces of info from this thread so far, IMO we can theoretically sequence it thus using the video from the left:
     <br/>

     00:18 Rotation. Normal takeoff config.
     <br/>
     00:24 Gear up starts. per Raffael with FF.
     <br/>
     ......... FR24 ADSB last transmission (71ft, 172kt) just before runway threshold. Matches with video aircraft altitude at 1/2 wingspan.
     <br/>
     ......... ? Full power flameout leaves N2 ~ 60%; Airspeed &lt; 200k so N2 will decay to 15% in 8-10s?
     <br/>

  There should not be a max pre-start EGT limit in-flight - that should only occur on the ground for a pilot-initiated Autostart where the starting EGT redlines are lower than for in-flight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In-flight, the Autorelight function should attempt to restart the engine as soon as a flameout is detected, and for an engine flaming out at high power it might catch it before it even goes sub-idle.  Generally, Autorelight will continue attempting until some cutoff N2 at which time it will stop attempting, or if the pilot move the fuel switch to Cutoff.  And while the EEC is still powered (via its own PMA) down to roughly 10% N2, the ignition exciters required for Autorelight do get their power from the airplane.

     Even though there is no point speculating about the cause of this accident, it is the nature of the beast to have questions. As pilots (most of us at least), we do have an inquiring mindset.
     <br/>
     For me, a dual engine flameout seems the only possible explanation, now we only have to wait for its cause.

  If you read the MMEL for the 787, like most passenger jets there's a LOT of stuff that can be inop and you can still dispatch. APU, one of two center hydraulic pumps, etc. Not suprising to those if you in the industry but perhaps mildly disturbing to the rest of us.  I'm wondering how much other stuff could be not working without being noticed. Specifically I'm wondering about the suction pumping of fuel on the engines. Since the normal mode is to run all of the fuel pumps, the suction pump mode is always overridden by boost pressure from the electrics. Might it be possible for wear, improper maintenence or some other issue to cause this standby suction feature to not actually work? Is it routinely tested and if so, how often? The idea here is that if the engines were not capable of sucking up fuel on their own, the airplane would be operated indefinitely without anyone knowing until one day there is a catastrophic electrical malfunction at an inopportune time. In this case, that might correspond with the cessation of the ADS-B data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I'm asking this as a question, not claming to have "cracked the case". I'm not an aviation fuel system expert. Can anyone who is or has direct knowledge comment? The reason I thought of it is that I've seen very similar issues with diesel engine systems where the mechanical injection pump can typically suck fuel but is normally fed with pressure. An internal (or external) leak can cause it to not be able to suction fuel properly but as long as the other pumps keep it pressurized it can work forever.

  What concerns me a little bit is if indeed AC power is lost, would the suction feed inlets in the wing tanks provide enough fuel flow to maintain TO thrust?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I know the system is designed to achieve this in a situation where all of the AC powered boost pumps are lost. But what about in a real situation...
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Could this cause a degradation of thrust? Even the slightest decrease..

     Given the loads on the generators etc. at TO, I would say it won't take very long for the engine to spool down. Maybe around 5-7 seconds. Any differing opinions?

  Once the fuel LP and HP Shutoff valves are open, they stay there until commanded otherwise so an AC power failure will have no affect. They will remain in the last position at the time of the loss. They will then be on suction feed which, by design, should enable the engines to maintain their selected thrust level. They &lsquo;should&rsquo; not suffer any loss of thrust.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Edit note: the engines have their own engine driven fuel pumps which can deliver anywhere up to and above 1,100 psi.

  I believe the point being made by the person you quoted was that the noise of the engines might have become much quieter

  the start of the video with the possible RAT noise (the one where the plane passes almost overhead).

     During the nearly two years that elapsed between AF 447 disappearing and the recovery of the flight data recorders nobody suggested that the PF might have, unwittingly, flown the aircraft, stalled, into the ocean.

     AI 171 may prove to also have a totally unpredicted cause.

  This was my thinking too. Extending this thinking, the technical aspect is generally quite predictable, the human element not so.

  I\x92m absolutely not speculating this is the case here, but could you not achieve the effect this flight suffered by just switching off the fuel control switches at 100ft on takeoff?

  There are now so many assumptions based on the assumed state of flap, RAT etc that it\x92s becoming pointless speculation.

  Can anyone familiar with the 787 built in overspeed protections comment on what could possibly override a pilots TOGA button command or fire walling the throttles?

  I am presuming that at some point just prior to the mayday call the pilots would have just commanded \x91full\x92 thrust and received no or a significantly mild response.

  I don\x92t think fuel contamination, birds or anything else external to the aircraft affected this crash. There is no evidence of it.

  could some combination of already MEL items and one or more faulty inputs to the computers cause the aircraft to \x91protect\x92 itself into the ground? Regardless of throttle position?

     I did read and search this thread, but I found nothing about ADS-B loss just before the end of the runway and at 71 ft high, according to FR24. ADS-B coverage is poor on the ground on the north-east part of the airfield (hence the fake news about taking off from the intersection) but I don't think it would be lost once airborne, except if it has been shut off... electrical failure ?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     more precisely, loss of the two Main AC buses (ADS-B not powered by

  787 has four main AC buses. Cannot find information on the standby/emergency buses but I would probably expect two.

  I can't see how gear pins would stop you doing anything more than raising the gear. They don't cause engine failure, RAT extension, or uncommanded flap retraction.

  If you had gear pins

     There have been a couple comments regarding the tilt of the bogies not corresponding to the landing configuration which have taken this as an indicator for an attempted (but failed) retraction.
     <br/>
     I don't think anybody has so far confirmed which of the two positions the bogie would have without hydraulic pressure, but I would strongly think it is the one used in the retraction/extension cycle and not the landing configuration, for the simple reason that otherwise the gravity drop would potentially not work (I assume it is tilted for the stowing because it would otherwise not fit).
     <br/>
     Maybe someone with concrete knowledge can confirm this?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     This would then only confirm that the bogies were unpressurized (likely because of loss of hydraulics, but of course could also still be a partial retraction that stopped for some reason)
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I did raise this earlier... FCOMs say that the bogies remain in the stowed tilt after a gravity drop, but I don't know if that's because the gear has springs to hold it that way without hydraulics, or just they close the valves on the hydraulics so it stays in the last commanded position without pressure.

  OK but the poster was asking about noise from a spooling down engine. I would have thought that would continue for a few seconds.. Thoughts?

     I have seen your previous posts about this, and I happen to agree. Visually, as a lay man non visuals expert, I am in your \xabcamp.\xbb
     <br/>
     <br/>
     However, the rat is small, and the artifacts are plentiful. Small sensor, compressed video, compressed upload, zoom, it is in short an awful source.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     However, the RAT is a much better noisemaker, and the audio signature is much more obvious than it\x92s visual appearance in this case, and though the recording isn\x92t fantastic quality, there was more than enough information there to objectively conclude the RAT is out. And that is my professional, on the weekend, opinion.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I want to ask a pretty frank question for all of you, and I hope it is ok, from an audio specialist non-pilot:
     <br/>
     Provided the engines spooled down. Provided the RAT is out. (There are no explosions, no bird strikes.)
     <br/>
     Isn\x92t software and previous electrical failures a red herring too?Would anything but a complete fuel shut off lead to this result? That still leaves everything from the Fate is the Hunter plot, to Airbus A350 center consoles and Alaska 2059 open as root causes.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  That leads to the next question.. Is there any system on the 787 that CAN shutdown the engines. We know there is at least one... But the A/C needs to be ground mode. However, if would not be the 1st time a system that should not deploy when the A/C is airborne, does! LaudaAir out from BKK is one example...

     On the B787/B788, you'd be expected to run it because you need the electrical power to spool up at least one of the engines, after which the one running engine can provide power to start the one yet to be started engine.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  787 can be started with no APU using three ground power units.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  (the manual implies two in a pinch, but you shed all loads except the engine starters and a fuel pump)
