     A long while ago I posted on the Rumour thread about a ban on drinks on the flight deck sent to a BA, A350 mid Atlantic. It was prompted by 2 separate instances of uncommanded unrecoverable engine shut downs due to drink spills across the fuel cut off switches. It was widely mocked by the professional pilots on here until proven to be absolutely factually correct. If we are into speculation why not a drink left on the flight deck tips on aircraft pitch up and spills across both fuel cut-switches. Just sayin

  It staggers me when I see flight deck crew balancing meal trays on their knees &amp; especially when I see open containers of liquid. Maybe nobody else remembers remembers the 1964 movie
  <i>

  , where an airliner goes down because coffee was spilled on the throttle cabinet. Why open liquids aren't banned on the flight deck is beyond me.

     Trying repeatedly to follow the whole thread plus updates but loading on the iPhone constantly jumps backwards and forwards making it a struggle to cover everything.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Two points which may or may not have relevance. One is just before the final crash, a dark-looking cover(?) flies up into the air. Could this be the first contact with sound that the surviving passenger alleges he heard?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Secondly the cost of aviation fuel seems to be comparatively more expensive in India than either Japan (leg before) or the UK (following leg). Would this effect refuelling procedures within India, supposing a company directive to save when possible?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     (Frequent long-haul passenger.)
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Good grief! They uploaded less fuel to save money??? That made the plane immediately sink to oblivion&hellip;because what? They ran out of fuel? You think airports all over India restrict fuel and endanger countless aircraft daily? It is the Captain&rsquo;s prerogative to sign off on fuel upload.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But let&rsquo;s run with it. Less fuel = lighter load. So&hellip;how does that make lift off/climb a more difficult procedure??? It shouid have been easier. How does that result in rapid loss of lift? Did they finish their tablespoon of fuel?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Or - if you are hinting at fuel contamination by being &ldquo;watered down&rdquo; somehow&hellip;why were no other aircraft affected? You might wish to consider Cathay Pacific flight 780, which suffered a serious fuel contamination incident. The problem was not initialiy detectable, but some engine underperformance was noted in one engine fairly early into the flght. The problems compounded during the flght from Surabaya to Hong Kong, culminating in complete engine shutdown. Fortunately, due to the experience and skill of Captain and Copilot, they just - only just - managed to land safely in Hong Kong. Point is - a crash scenario did not unfold in seconds.

     Many thanks. It still is a concern that the tilt has occurred but no doors have opened.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I have seen in manuals for other airliners that because the bogie tilt is by a hydraulic actuator, gravity deploying the gear means the gear doesn't tilt to landing position.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With the loss of centre-system pressure*, would you expect the bogies to tilt naturally? I.e. spring pressure holds the gear in the stowed tilt, a hydraulic cylinder pushes the gear to the landing tilt. No pressure means the gear returns to the 'stowed' tilt.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The tilt actuator is designed to be overridden when the bogie hits the ground, so perhaps it has some kind of intentional bypass and doesn't stay in place without continually applied hydraulic pressure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If so, that would also point towards total loss of electrics and no attempt to raise the gear.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  * 787 centre system is powered by two electric pumps, plus the RAT. The RAT hydraulic pump only powers flight controls, not the landing gear.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <b>
   Electric loss:
  </b>
  <br/>
  Surely even total AC power loss shouldn't result in engine loss, even if the RAT doesn't come online. The FADECs have their own alternators, bare minimum flight control computers and actuators are available on battery (though probably result in some equivalent of Direct Law), and boost pumps are unnecessary at low altitude. Left/right EDPs will remain active if the engines are running at any serious speed; providing flight controls.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Poor crew reaction to ending up in direct law is possible but it's hard to see the electrical issues as a cause, not a symptom.

  This got me thinking about a report I read where an Auckland based maintenance facility added too much biocide to an aircraft fuel tank by a factor of ten. From memory the Engineer simply read the instructions wrong or calculated the additive amount incorrectly and the cross checking systems were either not in place or they failed. I searched online for it but could only find the following;

  So my point is, if we are speculating about fuel contamination causing dual engine failure, it is possible that a fuel contaminant is specific to a particular airframe and not the supply system. Obviously not saying that is what happened here, but it goes to show how many possibilities exist.

  Fuel contamination is certainly a valid theory. The main thing working against it is that it would seem from the aircraft's flight path is that both engines failed at exactly the same time and lost thrust simultaneously. The chances of this are non zero, but remote. I say that as there appears to be no yaw, or other controlling of the aircraft - either by pilot or automation - that would suggest an asymmetric thrust scenario, even for a few seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yes, Jetstar had the biocide issue but did not immediately hit both engines within seconds of each other.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's my understanding that both engines draw fuel from independent sources during that time (which may be fed from a common source (eg central tank). But again, the odds of both failing at the exact same instant is low, but not zero.

  I'm no aircraft engineer but aren't tanks read by a capacitive system. Water in that quantity, having a greater dielectric constant than jet fuel (I'd like to say \xd7100) will show an impossible amount of fuel on the gauges.
  <br/>
  Also, for them to fail at exactly the same time with near full tanks (as evidenced from the explosion) doesn't give much credence to the contaminated fuel theory in my opinion.

   A summary of the more certain things we know about the accident so far:
  </span>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <span style="color:#000000">
   The takeoff run was from the full length and appeared normal, even after comparing with the same flight on previous days. This very much reduces the likelihood of it being a performance issue, e.g. wrong flaps, derate, ZFW/TOW, etc.
  </span>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <span style="color:#000000">
   Shortly after takeoff, the gear started retracting but stopped in an early intermediate position. At the same time the aircraft climb rate dropped off, then it started a shallow descent. This is consistent with a loss of electrical power causing a loss of hydraulic pressure and total engine thrust from both engines reducing below that generated by one engine at the takeoff setting. The position reporting also went offline at that moment, indicating that it was likely load shed due to an electrical malfunction. What exactly caused the engine/electrical issues remains speculative. An action slip mistaking flaps for gear seems much less likely as due to the above, the correct selection was probably made.
  </span>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <span style="color:#000000">
   From the videos of the last moments, there is strong evidence that the RAT was deployed, which has a very short list of possible triggers. The sole eye witness from inside describes power issues which lends credence.
  </span>

  Sometimes complex sequences can have very simple causalities. A lot of complex speculation in this thread so far focused on highly technical things. Yet the basic fundamentals of powered flight have not changed (despite our attempts to do so) over the past 100 years.
  <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
   <li>
    As a general rule it is a bad idea to run out of either altitude or airspeed or both.
   </li>
   <li>
    If you try to maintain altitude without sufficient thrust you will eventually run out of airspeed.
   </li>
   <li>
    If you have sufficient thrust you can maintain your altitude at a given airspeed, and if you have excess thrust you can maintain your airspeed and increase your altitude. If you have lots of excess thrust you can increase your altitude and increase your airspeed.
   </li>
   <li>
    If you try to increase your altitude by pitching the nose up, and without sufficient excess thrust, your speed will decay quickly, up to the point of stall, at which point you will lose any small amount of altitude you have gained and begin descending.
   </li>
  </ol>
  So&hellip;
  <br>
   <br>
    Fact 1: The airplane stopped going up because it lacked excess thrust necessary to sustain the climb, and;
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Fact 2: The airplane&rsquo;s airspeed decreased constantly because they were trying to maintain either altitude or the climb, but lacked the thrust to do so, and;
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Fact 3: If they had prematurely raised the flaps, the climb rate would have decreased/possibly turned negative, but the airplane would have continued to accelerate.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So where did the thrust go?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Fact 4: There is no adverse yaw seen in any of the videos, so wherever it went the loss of thrust occurred (nearly) simultaneously in both engines.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Fact 5: The only way to stop a jet engine from thrusting (sorry) is by either blowing it up or removing the fuel supply. If it blows up- like from birds trying to become a fuel source, there will be evidence. (See Jeju Air for a good example.)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Fact 6: There is (so far) no evidence of either engine blowing up. (I&rsquo;m deliberately using highly technical terms here&hellip;)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Fact 7: There is unmistakably clear audible evidence of the RAT being deployed on the raw video from the right rear quarter of the airplane. Near supersonic propellor blades are an unmistakable sound- the RAT was definitively deployed no matter how much people want to argue to the contrary.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Fact 8: In the same video there is silence from the engines when they should be thundering at full (or nearly full) power. (Yes, I know that isn&rsquo;t a thing- I am a simple man alas.)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thus the only possible conclusions are (cringes as he waits for fdr to rip him a new ah):
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
     <li>
      The engines stopped burning, at nearly the same moment in time.
     </li>
     <li>
      As a result, the airplane stopped climbing and also began to lose airspeed in an attempt to maintain altitude.
     </li>
     <li>
      The RAT being deployed so quickly means that the &lsquo;puters believed both engines were dead donks. (They were.)
     </li>
     <li>
      If both engines ceased burning it meant the fuel supply was interrupted. We aren&rsquo;t talking flight idle here- it was lights out for both.
     </li>
     <li>
      (I am quoting someone else here) There is enough suction for the fuel to feed even if the fuel pumps are inop.
     </li>
     <li>
      The engines stopped being provided with fuel. Because something physical was placed between the tanks and the burners. And they flamed out.
     </li>
    </ol>
    The $64,000 question here (remember when that was a lot of money??!!) is simply: What stopped both engines from getting fuel?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There are a very finite number of possibilities to that answer- and I do have my suspicions, but I lack the qualification to opine on that one.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I&rsquo;ll leave the rest to the more experienced folk here.

  How is misselected flap still being discussed? Misselected flap does not cause gear retraction to cease nor cause the RAT to deploy. Both of which are (subjectively) evidenced in the videos. What is the supporting evidence for misselected flap?

  Yes absolutely. 100% catastrophic loss of power when getting airborne. No evidence for bird strikes\x85no severe eng damage symptoms in the videos, no mention of birds in the mayday\x85
  <br/>
  <br/>
  they\x92ve gone TO power all the way to rotate, no power issues, no eng fuel issues, but as soon as its wheels off they lose all power. That can\x92t be coincidental. TCMA certainly fits this scenario especially with ground/air logic.

      A summary of the more certain things we know about the accident so far:
     </span>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <span style="color:#000000">
      The takeoff run was from the full length and appeared normal, even after comparing with the same flight on previous days. This very much reduces the likelihood of it being a performance issue, e.g. wrong flaps, derate, ZFW/TOW, etc.
     </span>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <span style="color:#000000">
      Shortly after takeoff, the gear started retracting but stopped in an early intermediate position. At the same time the aircraft climb rate dropped off, then it started a shallow descent. This is consistent with a loss of electrical power causing a loss of hydraulic pressure and total engine thrust from both engines reducing below that generated by one engine at the takeoff setting. The position reporting also went offline at that moment, indicating that it was likely load shed due to an electrical malfunction. What exactly caused the engine/electrical issues remains speculative. An action slip mistaking flaps for gear seems much less likely as due to the above, the correct selection was probably made.
     </span>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <span style="color:#000000">
      From the videos of the last moments, there is strong evidence that the RAT was deployed, which has a very short list of possible triggers. The sole eye witness from inside describes power issues which lends credence.

  Post 400\x92, on the assumption VNAV engages, the Flight Control Laws command pitch to maintain speed at VNAV engagement\x85up until Acceleration Altitude. So the aircraft will NOT accelerate like you assert in Fact 3. That is not a \x93fact\x94.

  I&rsquo;m not a 787 driver so for fear of looking dumb in front of those that are this still confuses me. Even IF they&rsquo;ve mis-selected the flap setting (I still don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s been cemented on here that there is in fact a FMS/flap setting disagreement warning but i believe there is), had the wrong de-rated take off settings, selected flaps instead of gear up the 787 with massive high bypass engines, FBW and full envelope protections surely cannot let itself be put in such a low energy/high alpha regime as we saw in the videos IF it has both fans functioning normally, surely?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  the pilots may have messed up royally and numerous times so those holes lined up but the plane is the final block in the chain and a 21st century all digital entirely clean sheet design was sold as being immune to such catastrophic outcomes from a few minor (consequential yes) and fairly common errors- aren&rsquo;t all the protections and our procedures designed after decades of mistakes?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  im having a hard time squaring how a fully functioning modern bird like this could allow for this outcome and almost whatever the pilots did outside of unbelievable inputs and the pilots are are a bit of a red herring IMO

     No. The LE slats are deployed therefore the flaps are as well. This is an automatic linkage. The flaps are set at Take-Off. Hard to see from the angle but they are...if slats are out (easy to see) then flaps are set. Looks like Flaps 5. Also, the 787 has the highest Thrust-to-Weight ratio of any airliner on Earth. The change in Alpha and lift is a trifling matter for it, at these settings (1-5). It will fly out of it easily, even at that density altitude. The attitude change is - in the circumstances I describe, consistent with a massive power loss (both sides). I believe based on probability that simultaneous mechanical failure is not the cause. Fuel contamination or starvation is likewise unlikely based on the 787 fuel system. The common element is the FADEC/Autothrottle/TOGO. However, each engine FADEC is dual redundant two channels. So any such common failure must happen further upstream. From a design perspective, that would be unthinkable. But this is Boeing. Given what I can see with my own eyes, I believe the flap issue is a non-starter. Also, re the landing gear: Clearly the Positive Rate challenge would be met based on normal rotation and fly-off at V2. But since we know the flaps were set correctly, that rules out an "oopsie" moment. Just as likely there was at the challenge moment an indication that something was amiss, and the Gear Up call was not made. They see both N1s unwinding and it takes a second to get past the WFT factor. They cross-check and see the airspeed also unwinding. Then they unload the Alpha and pitch to gear down Vy. And they had another 6 seconds. Whatever it was, it was not a flap, mechanical or fuel issue. We will know soon enough. But this is Boeing. My gut says "software". All 787s worldwide need to be grounded, now.

     Media translated what the survivor said as thrust was added prior to impact but a more correct translation is he said the engines revved or accelerated just prior to impact.

  If this is correct, does it point more towards the engines having been erroneously shut down earlier, rather than a fuel starvation or contamination issue?

      <br>
       <span style="color:#000000">
        The takeoff run was from the full length and appeared normal, even after comparing with the same flight on previous days. This very much reduces the likelihood of it being a performance issue, e.g. wrong flaps, derate, ZFW/TOW, etc.

       <br>
        <br>
         <span style="color:#000000">
          Shortly after takeoff, the gear started retracting but stopped in an early intermediate position. At the same time the aircraft climb rate dropped off, then it started a shallow descent. This is consistent with a loss of electrical power causing a loss of hydraulic pressure and total engine thrust from both engines reducing below that generated by one engine at the takeoff setting. The position reporting also went offline at that moment, indicating that it was likely load shed due to an electrical malfunction

  Hello all,
  <br>
   I personally think this is a good summary of what we can ascertain at this point from the evidence we have.
   <br>
    I am not a 787 driver by any means but with a fair bit of aviation experience. I would be interested in any thoughts on this suggestion regarding loss of thrust:
    <br>
     If we take it as a reasonable assumption as above that it is almost simultaneous loss of significant thrust, and for the good reasons already discussed, it is pretty unlikely that from what we can see/analyse, that the cause of this would be bird strike (expect to see some signs on video if it's significant enough to cause double engine failure) nor fuel contamination (reasons as above re: likelihood, other ac affected and simultaneous nature). TCMA I don't know enough about but it seems that the sensor redundancy/logic protection is so high it would not be the sole cause.
     <br>
      On this basis, should we perhaps consider the causality of a total electrics failure of some kind first, leading to deployment of the RAT, gear retraction cease etc. Clearly the independent FADEC power generation systems would mean this doesn't on its own prevent thrust control of the engines but could we then be looking at cascading faults (possibly exacerbated by latent faults below the MEL/defect threshold) that contribute to dual power loss and sensor/system issues in throttle response not resulting in FADEC commands to the engines to increase thrust. So even at that point 'firewalling' the throttles could tragically not recover the situation?
      <br>
       Very happy to be corrected by those with much more experience and understanding of big jets operations and systems!

  Having looked at the photos of the wings, one wing appears to have flaps and slats, the other does not.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  this could be from post impact damage, but an interesting observation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From what I can see so far, there is an electrical event that occurs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  but why and how that causes an aircraft to crash, is to be determined.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is either going to be a very quick or very long investigation, no in-between.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  My gut instinct is this is going to be a previously unexpected or unplanned failure that, whilst there was redundancy (expected) it took it all out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  although a totally unrelated incident, it reminds me of the LHR 777 with the fuel pump heaters being designed to stop ice getting into the lines. But on that exact day, conditions and variables, the very system designed to mitigate said problems, became the problem.

  My next question, again I believe not discussed, is what do the 787 Fuel Cutoff switches actually do? Obviously, they cut off the fuel supplies to the engines - pretty important in engine fire and other scenarios, but goes without saying. The real question is, what do they activate (or deactivate)? I'm assuming a simple solenoid valve, which is open when powered and closed when unpowered, but of course, there will (certainly) be Electro-Mechanical or Solid-State (Electronic) relays between the switches and the (solenoid valves).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I guess the next obvious question is, is there anything else that can turn off those Fuel Cutoff Valves - a computer condition for example. I'm assuming not, but I think it needs to be considered.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Taking each switch individually, next, since this is part of an electrical circuit, and of necessity must include Electrical Relays, there is certainly at least one and in all probability two electric Power Sources involved in this circuit. One supply which passes through the switch to activate the relay, and, I'm assuming, a second, higher current and probably higher voltage supply which drives the (solenoid?) valve.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As I see it, interrupting either supply will have the same effect - if the system is wired in the Positive-Postive sense, meaning a current through the switch causes the relay to pass a current through the (solenoid). If either of these supplies is cut, the Fuel Shutoffs will shut off the fuel. So, the question is, where do these supplies come from, and under what circumstances could they be cut off?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sure, it looks to some (myself included) like a near simultaneous cutoff of both engines, but that doesn't have to have been caused by either of the pilots. I know there is huge redundancy built into the 787 Electrical Systems, but some of the evidence is suggesting that there was something not right with the plane's electrical system. I'm also fairly sure that there will be parts and places where certain faults can take the system down, despite the redundancy. I can't say where, but it's very difficult to design a perfect system, especially where there has to be transfers between multiple potential supplies and single actuators, motors or valves.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Having spent years repairing electrical and electronic systems, I know that the most difficult of all electrical faults are the intermittent ones. And I suspect that this is at the root of this crash. An intermittent or faulty AOA sensor has "caused" (provoked) multiple famous crashes... Can't find the one I'm looking for (pre-1980, I think) as the Max AOA issues dominate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I can cite a very personal example, which involved the electrical supply to my house. I had several computers running 24x365 so of course, ran them off a UPS, which turned out to be a very good thing. I started to notice that at certain times, the UPS would activate - it would cut in and take over the computer loads, its alarm would go off to indicate a power fault. But the power was still on! This carried on for weeks and I initially blamed the UPS. Then, I noticed that it only happened on very hot afternoons...  Long story short, the fault was caused by an electrical linesman, probably 30 years earlier, failing to tighten up a joint clamp on the phase wire to our house, across the street. Heating caused expansion then movement, and the power would momentarily go off then back on, and the UPS detected this. I note that this crash was on a hot day, and maybe this plane (which I believe was repositioned for the flight), had not been operating in such high temperatures recently, meaning the problem went unnoticed.

     Even though there is no point speculating about the cause of this accident, it is the nature of the beast to have questions. As pilots (most of us at least), we do have an inquiring mindset.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     My initial thoughts were an inadvertent flap retraction. But with the &lsquo;evidence&rsquo; that has been presented over the last 48 hours, I think we can safely discard that option.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     What we think we know is:
     <br/>
     - RAT was deployed (highly possible)
     <br/>
     - Gear was selected up, but did not operate (bogey tilted, doors remained closed)
     <br/>
     - APU was &lsquo;on&rsquo; (APU door open on after crash pictures)
     <br/>
     - Flight path
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Any of these observations, alone, would mean very little. However, in combination, they all point to a dual engine flameout just at/after the rotation. The aircaft has enough kinetic energy to reach roughly 150ft altitude, end then starts a shallow descent at &lsquo;alpha max&rsquo; into the buildings ahead. The RAT deployed, APU attempted auto-start, gear was unable to retract.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I only wonder why the engines spooled down. Bird strike seems to be out of the question, so that leaves us with only a very few options, which include a software bug or a suicidal pilot (not a popular option, I understand, but we have to take all options into account).
     <br/>
     <br/>
     What I don&rsquo;t believe is incorrect FCU selections, since that would not explain the high AOA on impact. It also would not explain the RAT, no gear retraction or the APU inlet flap open. Another thing that is highly unlikely is any switching done by the pilots, especially RAT etc.. These airborne time is just too little, pilots usually don&rsquo;t take any action below approximately 400ft, and these switches are so &lsquo;underused&rsquo; that a pilot would not find them instantaneously in a high stress situation.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     For me, a dual engine flameout seems the only possible explanation, now we only have to wait for its cause.

  Is it possible to operate the fuel cut-off switches accidently?

  I asked this yesterday, and was told no. You have to pull them out before you can move them up or down. So you can't operate them if, say, your hand slips violently off the throttle lever and drops down into the switches.

  This crash reminds me of the crash of a 747 Military Transport plane at an airbase in Afghanistan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shortly after TO, the cargo shifted, the plane became very tail heavy and stalled a few hundred feet in the air. It was the weirdest sight. For what seems a few seconds, the plane just seemed to hang there, presumably on engine thrust.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In this crash, the problem also seems to occur soon after rotation, as if something inside moved in response to its change in attitude. Maybe a loose connection on a main bus cable that moved... Maybe only a millimetre. Or a tool left inside an electrical cabinet slid somewhere it shouldn't. The possibilities are numerous, and without a lot more information, there's no way to know what caused this. I suspect a major electrical fault, probably intermittent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  How long would it take to restart those engines after a Fuel Cutoff flame out?  Is that what happened, just before impact?
