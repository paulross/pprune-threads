     Without going round the hamsterwheel again does anyone have an actual reference for this? Because I've gone back through each of tdracer's very informative posts about this
     <a href="https://www.pprune.org/accidents-close-calls/666581-air-india-ahmedabad-accident-12th-june-2025-part-2-a-2.html#post11903420" target="_blank">
      see here
     </a>
     and there is a discrepancy in the two points he makes below in adjacent posts. Is tdracer talking about the same HPSOV valves? Can anyone confirm that with both AC power loss and and a temporary DC power loss there are no critical engine related shutoff valves that will fail safe (unpowered) in a closed position?
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Thanks for those two quotes. I had only used the first one in my previous reference to HPSOV operation. I have only been involved with Boeing spar valves and not any HPSOV. However, I do not see that spring shutoff when less than 300 psi is in conflict with staying open if electrical power is lost.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hopefully tdracer will provide more detail if/when he re-joins the discussion.

  HPSOVs within the FADEC are solenoid controlled but hydraulic (fuel) actuated. The valve will remain in the last commanded position if power is lost. This is very unlikely as FADECs have a small gearbox driven generator that supplies basic electrical power and engine speed info for engine control and command functions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  LPSOVs are motor driven sliding gate valves 28V DC from a hot battery bus.

     787 pilots, If throttles are NOT at idle, will their respective fuel cut off switches still trigger a shutdown?
     <br>
      <br>
       The above checklist procedure implies throttle lever angle and cutoff switches are independant for resetting FADECs.
       <br>
        <br>
         If so, is it time for this convention from the days where throttles and cutoffs were mechanical systems, not resolvers and switches, to end?
         <br>
          <br>
           Risk vs reward? Requires more coordination between PF and PM in cases where cutoff is not desired by PF- keep throttle/s up, cannot be surprised by a fuel cutoff.

  Yes, switch directly controls spar valve (fuel supply) position - no fuel - no fire.

  Thank you so much for that particular schematic, it confirms the direct link between the switches and the fuel cut off without software in between.
  <br/>
  The switch itself is 4-pole, or a double-on, double-on switch, capable of independentently signaling whrough completely isolated poles. The plot thickens. IF the switches really are involved, there is either some kind of shortcut in within the LRU/very messed up witing harness, some freak automated muscle memory thing or deliberate action.

  To be less subtle- someone cuts off switches, unknown to PF and possibly PM, with throttles off idle... Would do nothing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Worst case, at next idle TLA, engine shuts down. I bet eyes go to cutoff switches after a scan, surely EICAS/ECAM has a Captain Obvious alert set.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Runaway RPM or locked RPM, some FADECS latch at 86 or so % N1- you'd still need TLA of idle for the cut off switch to work.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Volcanic ash, loss of all engines, desire the simultaneous FADEC reset of cycling the cutoffs- just coordinate with PM for idle TLA.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other jets have this standard, today.

     You do not want a condition where you can't shut the fuel off when you need to because some condition is not met.

  I'd say the throttle needing to be at idle is one heck of a CRM/TEM-based reason. Dual resolvers can fail, but throttles no longer get locked by jammed cable runs to the FCU on the engine. A resolver bypass would possibly be required in extremis 10 to the minus 6 to 9th case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Who flies the throttles in normal? PF
  <br/>
  Who typically performs the steps, including idle TLA of shutdown/restart in flight? PM.

  What is the basis for that statement?  Hasn't it been stated, more than once, that thrust lever position has no influence on control of the spar valves?

  Just for emphasis, the fuel control switches control both the spar valve AND the shutoff inside the fuel controller at the engine.  It&rsquo;s not the spar valve the starves the engine of fuel it&rsquo;s the HP valve.    If it were only the spar valve, shut downs at the gate would take awhile.

  Not entirely correct, the engine fuel valve is controlled by fire handle, the spar valves are at the tank. See attached.

   Have not had all electrical on switches, throttles  and electrical circuits for isolation, only- which allows for more options and unintended consequences.

     The "Spar valves" ahould be on the fire levers/switches. FADECS/Pylons on the cutoff switches.

  That functional separation exists on MD-11 (for which I see you are rated) but not for 777 and 787.  The key difference is that MD-11 fire shut off valves (equivalent to Boeing spar valves) are mechanically operated but 777 and 787 spar valves are electrically operated.

  <br/>
  Boeing chose to have both the HP and spar valves controlled by the fire handles AND the cut off switches.

   This has all been answered in previous posts, but I'll repeat it for those you don't want to look back through something like 150 pages:
  </span>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <span style="color:#000000">
   Thrust Lever Angle (TLA) is measured directly by the FADEC, using a resolver hardwired to and excited by the FADEC. Both FADEC channels have their own resolver input - on most Boeing aircraft it's a common resolver with two sets of electrically isolated windings, however on the 787 it actually uses two mechanically separate resolvers. The resolver is basically read as "sine" and "cosine" which is converted in the angle. This also makes error detection easy, using the sine squared + cosine squared relationship. Any other aircraft systems that use TLA use the TLA signal relayed back to the aircraft by the FADEC.
  </span>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <span style="color:#000000">
   The fuel control switch is a two-position multiple pole 'latching' switch - you have to pull it out slightly over detent to move it between the RUN and CUTOFF positions (on other aircraft there is an interposing relay for some of the functions. not sure about the implementation on the 787). Moving the switch to cutoff sends a DC signal to both the High Pressure ShutOff Valve (HPSOV) in the fuel control and the spar valve commanding them to close. HPSOV is solenoid actuated and is near instantaneous, Spar Valve takes ~one second to change positions (yes, this is different than some other airframers that only send the signal to one valve or the other, but it's been standard Boeing design practice since the early 1970s). Both the HPSOV solenoid and the Spar Valve are designed to stay in their last commanded position if airframe power is lost. Moving the switch to CUTOFF also sends a 'reset' signal to the FADEC - meaning the FADEC will be offline for roughly one second. On the 787 (and 777 and 747-8), there is a brief pause (~0.25 seconds) before the shutdown signal is sent to the engine to allow the electrical system to reconfigure to prevent a brief interrupt of electrical power to the rest of the aircraft.
  </span>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <span style="color:#000000">
   Pulling the Fire Handle does the same thing as the fuel condition switch - via separate wiring (physically isolated from the fuel switch wiring to help protect from things like rotor burst damage), with the exception of the FADEC reset (since there is no requirement to be able to restart the engine after a Fire Handle shutdown).

   All this is standard Boeing design practice (and except for the no-break electrical power transfer) has been for at least 50 years. This is enforced by the Boeing "Design Requirements and Objectives" - DR&amp;O - compliance with is demonstrated by an audit after the final design freeze.

     A douple-pole switch. One pole used for FDR signal for the physcial switch position. The other pole for the electrical switching circuit.

  That would only make a duplicate, wouldn\x92t it.
  <br/>
  And indeed they are 4 pole on-on switches, but one set of poles signals the spar valve directly while the other goes to the digital systems.
