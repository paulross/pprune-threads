     One has to assume that, given the seeming lack of lateral deviation from the flight path, and with no obvious yawing or rudder input visible on the videos, there's only two realistic conclusions here? Simultaneous dual engine failure of unknown cause if the RAT was indeed deployed; or flaps reduced too early leading to a stall if the RAT wasn't deployed.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Evidence in this thread would lean me toward the RAT deployed and therefore dual engine out scenario. As for the cause of that, well, only a couple of likely scenarios exist that could cause simultaneous shutdown of both engines, including mistaken or intentional use of the fuel cutoff levers.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  A long while ago I posted on the Rumour thread about a ban on drinks on the flight deck sent to a BA,  A350 mid Atlantic. It was prompted by 2 separate instances of  uncommanded  unrecoverable engine shut downs due to drink spills across the fuel cut off switches. It was widely mocked by the professional pilots on here until proven to be absolutely factually correct. If we are into speculation why not a drink left on the flight deck tips on aircraft pitch up  and spills across both fuel cut-switches. Just sayin

  Former Boeing Engineer, actually worked on this specific airplane prior to delivery.  To me this all comes down to if the RAT was actually out.  If not, lots of different factors people have already debated and likely some sort of pilot error that I'll let the pilots on this forum debate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If the RAT did come out, then we are looking at simultaneous dual engine failure basically at V2 which is so improbable (without bird strikes or purposeful actions) that it is basically impossible.  This is a 330 Min ETOPS aircraft.   I saw no rudder deflection or yaw indicating 1 engine failed first and then they shut down the second one on accident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Only two realistic options for me in that case are:
  <br/>
  1. cutoff of the engines by the pilots.  Either on purpose or accidental.
  <br/>
  2. maintenance actions by the Air India ground team that caused issues with the engine system or power generation system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  2 is the only one I haven't seen mentioned here and I say this as a no longer Boeing employee.  We STRUGGLED with AI during the EIS.  They were notorious for just parking airplanes and then using them as spare parts and then screaming for help when they had to go back and get the planes ready to fly again.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Still think 1 is much more likely but will just throw out that 2 since there were complaints from previous flights about IFE and AC which to me speaks to issues with the power generation possibly being neglected.

  Not yet seen a response to my question about which engine parameters are recommended by the FDR and what is the sample rate.

  Hopefully you might be able to answer this.

  I am a retired gas turbine engineer who worked on safety systems and assessments and assisted on a number of accident investigations (military fast jets) and would be interested to know this.

  I'm pretty convinced that everyone is watching different videos, which wouldn't surprise me in the least given how much images and footage can get mangled from being downloaded/re-uploaded to different services. Personally I've seen at least two different videos (and slightly different variants of each): one that's a direct recording of the aircraft and one that's a recording of a phone playing a recording of the aircraft. The buzz of a propeller was quite audible in the former but not in the latter, and the engines are notably quiet compared to any 787 takeoff I've ever been close to.

  I do think that at this point people are working backwards from the cause being retracting the flaps, rather than working forwards from the evidence towards an explanation. If everything else was as it should be apart from flaps being retracted instead of gear, you'd at the very least expect the aircraft to reach a higher speed than is suggested by how little distance there is between the end of the runway and the crash site. Coupled with the apparently parabolic trajectory seen in the airport CCTV video, the crew (allegedly) reporting engine problems on the radio, the surviving passenger testifying about flickering cabin lights, the plausible deployment of the RAT, the fact that the ADS-B data cuts out well before impact...surely at some point one
  <i>
   must
  </i>
  consider a lack of thrust, no matter how improbable. Recognising the
  <i>
   what
  </i>
  doesn't need a full thesis on the
  <i>
   how
  </i>
  .
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I wonder if (given
  <i>
   all
  </i>
  the facts and rumours about the situation so far) the flaps would be so high on everyone's minds if they weren't already a hot topic from the initial, largely baseless speculation that they somehow took off with flaps retracted.

  The nose gear angle suggest that the "gear-up" was selected and a dual engine failure happened at the same time, with the hydraulics failing and possible RAT deployment.. The APU was not running and everything, except the flight recorders, might be powered down and restarted at a very low altitude.

  In summary,
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Flaps were extended, possibly flaps 5 or 15. Looks like it in the video and clearly shown post crash.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Aircraft reached a height of just over 100\x92 AGL (possibly 200\x92 if you compare wingspan to height in videos)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  RAT was deployed. Seen on videos and heard conclusively.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Aircraft rotated at \x91usual\x92 spot. Comparing FR24 data from previous flights over the past week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Aircraft took off at \x91usual\x92 speed. Comparing other flights.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  FR24 data stopped being sent shortly after take off. Possibly indicating electrical fault.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Green and white flashing light reported by survivor. Possibly indicating electrical fault.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gear bogies were at unusual angle indicating Gear selected up and then interrupted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No smoke or flames to indicate bird strike. (Edit - still debate about this in the video above where the aircraft is behind a building)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No rudder input to indicate single engine failure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All speculation but hopefully a pretty balanced summary from the thread so far. It would be great if there was more focus now on what might have caused above rather than talking flaps, birds, 625\x92, etc.

  Can I just clarify: the 787 has FBW and certain flight envelope protections. If the pilots suffered a dual engine failure after takeoff, they would pull back to stretch the glide as the computers will not allow the aircraft to stall. This is effectively what Sully did when he kissed it into the Hudson like a pro.

     Let\x92s be careful about absolutes. Emirates 521 and Turkish 1951 are both examples of crews not firewalling the thrust levers despite low energy. The late pitch up could be due to the onset of a stall not an order from the crew.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     TCMA is function which can reduce thrust on both engines simultaneously. It had done so in error in the past resulting in an AD. It uses air/ground logic so that it only operates on the ground, however note that at the point of thrust loss the gear is still down without any movement of the gear or doors. I would expect gear retraction to start before that height. Could we imagine an air/ground logic fault inhibiting gear retraction and allowing TCMA, which triggered (for whatever reason!) causing dual thrust loss? I would expect this to be in the realms of a combination of failures shown to be extremely impossible, but\x85

  I have now watched a number of "normal" 787 takeoffs online and in none of them does the gear go up super early, certainly not before the 10 seconds or so where this one seems to loose power. I think the flap/gear raising is wrong personally

  I'm really trying to resist engaging here, but anyone who states what pilots, 'would', do in a given situation, simply hasn't grasped the most elementary, 1.01, fundamentals of human behaviour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Again and again, I've listened to CVRs, or looked at FDR plots, or sat next to people in a flight deck or crew room, or restaurant, or anywhere (but especially in the back of a simulator)... and pondered what on earth led competent individuals to do what I had just witnessed. Of course, if the individuals aren't competent to start with (and that is NOT directed at this crew, but embellishes my point) there may be less mystery.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also worth remembering, for those of us who do, the ludicrous training delivered by Airbus on the A320 family at the start, when they told people that, (a) pulling the stick back and holding it there will save you, and, (b) you don't need unusual attitude training in an FBW aircraft. I think we know how that played out. I'll add an element of my briefing for a departure in a single-engined aircraft, if a forced landing was not an option (eg Rochester, Biggin Hill), which also covers what I have always thought I would do faced with total power loss in a bigger machine, 'I will manoeuvre the aircraft to hit the softest thing I can, as slowly as possible'. Very glad I never had to see that through.

  Regardless of FBW on the Boeings the pilot can stall the aircraft. The 787 and 777 don't have hard protection like the Airbus. You will get force feedback as you approach the stall, but keep pulling on the yoke and the plane will stall.

     Can I just clarify: the 787 has FBW and certain flight envelope protections. If the pilots suffered a dual engine failure after takeoff, they would pull back to stretch the glide as the computers will not allow the aircraft to stall. This is effectively what Sully did when he kissed it into the Hudson like a pro.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     In any other aircraft, if you lose thrust in all your engines, you would be pushing the nose down immediately!
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Which is why the aircraft flew a very sweet descent, nose up, increasing pitch until the Stall.

  In the take off video I think there is a subtle yaw to the right at lift off (the moment it begins being obscured by the building in the foreground). There is then a massive blast of dust on the airfield on the left side of the aircraft as it lifts off. Later video audio suggests the engines were not at full power ( or even operating - just wind noise) and that the RAT was whirring. It also shows the fuselage wheel bogies were tilted forward - so wheels up has commenced - but the gear doors are not open.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Possible sequence: right engine failure at rotation, firewalling of left engine, lift off and positive rate, gear up lever activated, wheels tilt forward, left engine failure, RAT deployed, insufficient hydraulics to Open gear doors to complete gear up sequence, ongoing dual engine failure?

     OK, another hour spent going through all the posts since I was on last night...
     <br/>
     I won't quote the relevant posts as they go back ~15 pages, but a few more comments:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     TAT errors affecting N1 power set: The FADEC logic (BTW, this is pretty much common on all Boeing FADEC) will use aircraft TAT if it agrees with the dedicated engine inlet temp probe -
     <i>
      but if they differ it will use the engine probe
     </i>
     . The GE inlet temp probe is relatively simple and unheated, so (unlike a heated probe) a blocked or contaminated probe will still read accurately - just with greater 'lag' to actual temperature changes.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     TCMA - first off, I have to admit that this does look rather like an improper TCMA activation, but that is very, very unlikely. For those who don't know, TCMA is a system to shutdown a runaway engine that's not responding to the thrust lever - basic logic is an engine at high power with the thrust lever at/near idle, and the engine not decelerating. However, TCMA is
     <i>
      only
     </i>
     active on the ground (unfamiliar with the 787/GEnx TCMA air/ground logic - on the 747-8 we used 5 sources of air/ground - three Radio Altimeters and two Weight on Wheels - at least
     <i>
      one of each
     </i>
     had to indicate ground to enable TCMA). TCMA will shutdown the engine via the N2 overspeed protection - nearly instantaneous. For this to be TCMA, it would require at least two major failures - improper air ground indication or logic, and improper TCMA activation logic (completely separate software paths in the FADEC). Like I said, very, very unlikely.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Fuel contamination/filter blockage: The fuel filters have a bypass - if the delta P across the filter becomes excessive, the filter bypasses and provides the contaminated fuel to the engine. Now this contaminated fuel could easy foul up the fuel metering unit causing a flameout, but to happen to two engines at virtually the same time would be tremendous unlikely.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Auto Thrust thrust lever retard - the TO lockup in the logic makes this very unlikely (it won't unlock below (IIRC) 400 ft., and even that requires a separate pilot action such as a mode select change or thrust lever movement). And if it did somehow happen, all the pilot needs to do is push the levers back up.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Engine parameters on the FDR: I don't know what exactly is on the 787 FDR with regards to engine parameters, but rest assured that there is plenty of engine data that gets recorded - most at one/second. Getting the FDR readout from a modern FDR is almost an embarrassment of riches. Assuming the data is intact, we'll soon have a very good idea of what the engines were doing
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  The speed at which there was a complete loss of thrust and electrical power degrading to the point of flickering lights and RAT deployment suggests to me an actual engine shutdown rather than anything linked to auto thrust or fuel contamination. There are not many things which can cause an engine to shut down: LP valves, FADEC incl TCMA, crew action\x85

     Some kind of thrust problem, whether real or incorrectly perceived, might have prompted for the DUAL ENG FAIL memory item being carried out. This calls for cutting off both engines and then on again.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <img alt="" class="post_inline_image" src="https://cimg3.ibsrv.net/gimg/pprune.org-vbulletin/387x572/screenshot_2025_06_13_124751_cd83327e47d2878fb8f4889838314f59c08ab20f.png"/>

  We're all shouting each other down with two main different theories on why the aircraft lost lift so shortly after takeoff.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  1) Incorrect flap retraction causing the aircraft to lose lift and unable to recover the energy in time. (Not unheard of and plenty of reports where this has happened - albeit usually not to a crash).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  2) Loss of engine thrust backed up two potential pieces of evidence that back up the RAT was deployed (apparent RAT sound, potential RAT seen on low res video).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is impossible to know which of these is the case. Considering this summary of memory items is there the potential for a combination of both theories to have taken place?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Inadvertant flap retraction by PNF leading the PF to sense a sink and loss of lift. Pushes the thrust levers forward to the firewall and still the aircraft sinks. PF looking through the HUD and so very much 'outside focused' and doesn't realise that PNF has instead moved the flaps. PF defaults to memory items for loss of thrust on both engines before PNF can realise or communicate to PF what they've done, start switches are cut off which drops the RAT and from that point they're only heading one way. This would satisfy the strongly held belief that the RAT was extended, whilst also following the more likely initial cause of an action slip by PNF starting the sequence, rather than a dual engine failure.

     In summary,
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Flaps were extended, possibly flaps 5 or 15. Looks like it in the video and clearly shown post crash.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Aircraft reached a height of just over 100\x92 AGL (possibly 200\x92 if you compare wingspan to height in videos)
     <br/>
     <br/>
     RAT was deployed. Seen on videos and heard conclusively.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Aircraft rotated at \x91usual\x92 spot. Comparing FR24 data from previous flights over the past week.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Aircraft took off at \x91usual\x92 speed. Comparing other flights.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     FR24 data stopped being sent shortly after take off. Possibly indicating electrical fault.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Green and white flashing light reported by survivor. Possibly indicating electrical fault.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Gear bogies were at unusual angle indicating Gear selected up and then interrupted.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     No smoke or flames to indicate bird strike. (Edit - still debate about this in the video above where the aircraft is behind a building)
     <br/>
     <br/>
     No rudder input to indicate single engine failure.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     All speculation but hopefully a pretty balanced summary from the thread so far. It would be great if there was more focus now on what might have caused above rather than talking flaps, birds, 625\x92, etc.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I agree it is helpful to seek a consensus on some of these matters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The most productive responses would be along the lines of:-
  <br/>
  (1) I too have read all previous posts and agree that your summary reflects the current consensus,
  <br/>
  (2) I too have read all previous posts and agree your summary reflects the consensus
  <i>
   HOWEVER
  </i>
  I challenge that consensus because... [ [i]EITHER (a) reference to previous post that merits greater credence,
  <i>
   OR
  </i>
  (b) new evidence supplied],
  <br/>
  (3) I too have read all previous posts but I do NOT agree your summary reflects the consensus [explanation required].
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is not necessary for everyone who thinks (1) to say it (although some initial feedback would be useful!). However, if any of the more experienced and informed PPRuNers are thinking either (2) or (3) then it would be instructive to hear that.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  FWIW, yours strikes me as a reasonable summary of the best consensus I have been able to discern (as of ~30 minutes ago). There are multiple caveats to each line item, but I presume you've deliberately left those out for the sake of readability, so I'll do the same!
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The only comments I would add are:-
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - It's a stretch to say the RAT is seen or heard "conclusively". Doubts have been expressed about the video quality and there are dissenting views regarding the audio. If a few more people were able to wade in on the audio point in particular, this could be very beneficial in moving the discussion forward because the presence or otherwise of the RAT is significant to several competing theories.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - On the subject of audio, I am surprised there has not been more discussion regarding engine noise. In the primary eye witness video the (alleged) RAT can be heard distinctly, as can the sounds of distant impact. If the engines were working as expected when overflying the camera and then flying directly away from it, do we really not think the engine noise would be more conclusive, i.e. louder (notwithstanding quiet engines and derated takeoffs)?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Whichever way readers are leaning in the flaps versus power loss debate, surely these two points are pivotal, and we have actual evidence available to discuss?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - Gear bogies: I'm not sure a consensus has yet been reached regarding the angle of the bogies. (I am not personally qualified to comment on this - I am purely saying I don't see a clear consensus just yet among those who are)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - Mayday call: I don't recall seeing a confirmed source for the widely reported mayday. Others have brought this up in the thread but nobody appears to be able to confirm one way or the other. If accurate, its contents are informative. Am I right to presume that you have left it out of your summary due to a lack of confirmation?

    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Why the need to make the two theories fit in such a convoluted manner? Inadvertent flap retraction was theorised because people assumed that was most likely to have caused the loss of lift - hardly anyone believed dual engine failure was possible. Now we know that the loss of lift was indeed almost certainly caused by a loss of engine power, why all these awkward attempts to reverse engineer it to still fit the flap retraction theory? People need to realise they are only trying to make the flap retraction theory fit because of cognitive biases. If we had all been told immediately, there was dual power loss and the RAT deployed, no-one would even be considering flaps. Its confirmation bias of past assumptions, that's all.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As has been said many times as well, the landing gear retraction process appears to start as the bogies tilt, and then suddenly stops. Which rather suggests they did pull the gear lever. Based on the videos and the amount of speed the plane lost in the very brief sequence ovents, I'd say that the plane lost power a lot earlier than it would have in your theory.
