  SLF here, retired physicist, but with much engineering (esp. systems engineering) background and considerable interest/experience in fault-finding in complex (not aircraft) systems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I think it is helpful here to work through some possible failure scenarios in some detail. You could usefully partition these into two separate groups: &ldquo;RAT was deployed&rdquo; and &ldquo;RAT was not deployed.&rdquo; I&rsquo;ll mostly follow the former here.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  \xb7 By following this path, I think we can exclude incorrect flaps setting or premature flap retraction as the primary cause of the crash. It&rsquo;s difficult to see how improper use of the flaps would be correlated with RAT deployment. Everything in this case points to a loss of engine thrust.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  \xb7 The first question is, why did the RAT deploy? As I understand it, manual deployment by a pilot is possible, or automatic deployment caused by detection of major electrical or engine failures. I haven&rsquo;t found an authoritative, detailed discussion of this, or about the time to deployment, which is relevant here as there is so little time involved.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  \xb7 According to
  <b>
   tdracer
  </b>
  , if the primary issue was a major electrical failure, that should not have caused any engine rollback. Thus, absent pull back of the throttles (which surely would have been corrected by the pilots), there should not have been a loss of thrust.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  \xb7 Thus we are left with engine rollback as the likely underlying problem. Absent other issues, a single engine rollback should not have been a major problem, so dual rollback, unlikely as it might be, seems a reasonable conclusion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  \xb7 This is consistent with the reported mayday call, although that report needs confirmation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  \xb7 It is difficult to understand a dual engine rollback. Various causes have been suggested but ruled &ldquo;unlikely&rdquo; here. However, it is not possible to rule out a unicorn event, like the dual engine rollback experienced by BA 38. Leaving aside the cause, it is useful to look at the consequences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  \xb7 There would have been a major loss of electrical power (apart from battery backup), assuming the APU was not running. I don&rsquo;t know if is possible the APU might be used at takeoff (e,g., to unload the main engines), or if any evidence from the tail photo at the crash site provides a meaningful indication (e.g., intake door status).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  \xb7 Are there other indications of loss of electrical power? The reported statements of the surviving passenger may have some relevance, but I would want to see the results of an interview by crash investigators.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  \xb7 What about the loss of Flight Aware ADS-B data shortly after takeoff? There have been a few mentions of this, but not much discussion. Could this indicate loss of electrical power?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I hope this is of some use. I&rsquo;m happy to defer to professionals or others here for better information/analysis.

  Interested observer here, nothing more; with a question:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If the mayday call has been reported correctly, it states: \x91Mayday! No thrust. Losing power. Cannot lift.\x92
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Is the term \x91Cannot lift\x92 standard comms for lack of climb rate/stall? If not, it strikes me that the transcript is incomplete, either due to loss of comms, inaudibility, or even just bad reporting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  \x91Cannot lift gear\x92?

     In summary,
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Flaps were extended, possibly flaps 5 or 15. Looks like it in the video and clearly shown post crash.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Aircraft reached a height of just over 100\x92 AGL (possibly 200\x92 if you compare wingspan to height in videos)
     <br/>
     <br/>
     RAT was deployed. Seen on videos and heard conclusively.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Aircraft rotated at \x91usual\x92 spot. Comparing FR24 data from previous flights over the past week.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Aircraft took off at \x91usual\x92 speed. Comparing other flights.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     FR24 data stopped being sent shortly after take off. Possibly indicating electrical fault.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Green and white flashing light reported by survivor. Possibly indicating electrical fault.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Gear bogies were at unusual angle indicating Gear selected up and then interrupted.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     No smoke or flames to indicate bird strike. (Edit - still debate about this in the video above where the aircraft is behind a building)
     <br/>
     <br/>
     No rudder input to indicate single engine failure.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     All speculation but hopefully a pretty balanced summary from the thread so far. It would be great if there was more focus now on what might have caused above rather than talking flaps, birds, 625\x92, etc.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I agree it is helpful to seek a consensus on some of these matters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The most productive responses would be along the lines of:-
  <br/>
  (1) I too have read all previous posts and agree that your summary reflects the current consensus,
  <br/>
  (2) I too have read all previous posts and agree your summary reflects the consensus
  <i>
   HOWEVER
  </i>
  I challenge that consensus because... [ [i]EITHER (a) reference to previous post that merits greater credence,
  <i>
   OR
  </i>
  (b) new evidence supplied],
  <br/>
  (3) I too have read all previous posts but I do NOT agree your summary reflects the consensus [explanation required].
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is not necessary for everyone who thinks (1) to say it (although some initial feedback would be useful!). However, if any of the more experienced and informed PPRuNers are thinking either (2) or (3) then it would be instructive to hear that.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  FWIW, yours strikes me as a reasonable summary of the best consensus I have been able to discern (as of ~30 minutes ago). There are multiple caveats to each line item, but I presume you've deliberately left those out for the sake of readability, so I'll do the same!
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The only comments I would add are:-
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - It's a stretch to say the RAT is seen or heard "conclusively". Doubts have been expressed about the video quality and there are dissenting views regarding the audio. If a few more people were able to wade in on the audio point in particular, this could be very beneficial in moving the discussion forward because the presence or otherwise of the RAT is significant to several competing theories.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - On the subject of audio, I am surprised there has not been more discussion regarding engine noise. In the primary eye witness video the (alleged) RAT can be heard distinctly, as can the sounds of distant impact. If the engines were working as expected when overflying the camera and then flying directly away from it, do we really not think the engine noise would be more conclusive, i.e. louder (notwithstanding quiet engines and derated takeoffs)?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Whichever way readers are leaning in the flaps versus power loss debate, surely these two points are pivotal, and we have actual evidence available to discuss?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - Gear bogies: I'm not sure a consensus has yet been reached regarding the angle of the bogies. (I am not personally qualified to comment on this - I am purely saying I don't see a clear consensus just yet among those who are)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - Mayday call: I don't recall seeing a confirmed source for the widely reported mayday. Others have brought this up in the thread but nobody appears to be able to confirm one way or the other. If accurate, its contents are informative. Am I right to presume that you have left it out of your summary due to a lack of confirmation?

  Thanks for the response. All great points you raise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I simply forgot to mention the Mayday. I think there are enough sources to suggest one was made but I\x92m slightly wary of its content.
  <br/>
  The recording and rebroadcast of RT exchanges is illegal in India as it is in the U.K. so we can\x92t be sure until its official release.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gear bogies - This was also mentioned by Juan Browne/Blancolirio as something to focus on, that\x92s probably what swayed me on this.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I was initially in the gear up/flaps up camp but I\x92ve been impressed by the testimonies of others here, particularly by the poster who\x92s heard hundreds of these overhead and the several videos shared for comparison.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As you say, hopefully we can put most of these topics to bed now (unless there is contradictory new evidence) and focus instead on where Occam\x92s razor points us.

     Having read all the posts, watched the videos and with a 30 year background interest in air safety, I have a nagging feeling that the engine fuel cut off switches were pulled just after take-off. I am not saying this with the intention of idle speculation, it is just that to me nothing else seems to make sense. To anyone disagreeing with this, I really hope you are right and I am wrong.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  In addition, does it make sense to issue any Mayday call, as was reported? If both engines are not producing thrust and an impact is imminent, would any pilot not spend all conscious effort in solving the problem. Such as by going through the appropriate checklists. Every private pilot learns in flight school "aviate, navigate, communicate", in that order. Is it not mighty weird that a pilot would find it more important to communicate?

     I've been closely examining a video frame captured very early in the footage depicting the aircraft's final moments. In this particular frame, I believe the
     <b>
      left main landing gear (MLG) door is clearly visible in the open position
     </b>
     , while the
     <b>
      right MLG door appears closed
     </b>
     . Additionally, both
     <b>
      main gear bogies are noticeably tilted forward
     </b>
     \x97 a configuration that typically occurs at the initiation of the gear retraction sequence.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     This combination strongly suggests that a
     <b>
      gear retraction was commanded
     </b>
     , but the
     <b>
      sequence was interrupted and never completed
     </b>
     . What\x92s particularly striking is the
     <b>
      asymmetry
     </b>
     \x97 the left door open, the right door closed \x97 which should not occur during normal operations and points toward a possible
     <b>
      hydraulic failure scenario
     </b>
     during retraction.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     As many will know, on the Boeing 787-8,
     <b>
      each main gear door is hydraulically actuated and powered by its respective side\x92s hydraulic system
     </b>
     \x97 the
     <b>
      left gear door by the left hydraulic system
     </b>
     , and the
     <b>
      right by the right
     </b>
     . This leads me to propose the following hypothesis:
     <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
      <li>
       Shortly after rotation, with a positive rate of climb established, the
       <b>
        flight crew commands gear up
       </b>
       .
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       The
       <b>
        gear retraction sequence initiates
       </b>
       ; the
       <b>
        main gear bogies tilt forward
       </b>
       , consistent with the start of retraction.
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       <b>
        The right engine fails first
       </b>
       , resulting in a
       <b>
        loss of right hydraulic system pressure
       </b>
       . Consequently, the
       <b>
        right MLG door does not open
       </b>
       .
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       The
       <b>
        left MLG door, still powered by the left hydraulic system, opens
       </b>
       .
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       <b>
        Moments later, the left engine also fails
       </b>
       , leading to
       <b>
        loss of the left hydraulic system
       </b>
       . With the door now open but no remaining hydraulic pressure,
       <b>
        the left main gear remains extended and the door remains open
       </b>
       .
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       The
       <b>
        ram air turbine (RAT) deploys
       </b>
       , consistent with total engine and electrical power loss.
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       With the
       <b>
        loss of thrust from both engines
       </b>
       , the aircraft loses lift and enters an unrecoverable descent, tragically ending in impact.
       <br/>
      </li>
     </ol>
     This sequence would explain the
     <b>
      partially completed gear retraction
     </b>
     and the
     <b>
      asymmetric gear door position
     </b>
     observed in the video evidence. It\x92s worth noting that the timing of the hydraulic losses would have to be
     <b>
      very close together
     </b>
     \x97 potentially within seconds \x97 which aligns with a
     <b>
      dual engine failure shortly after take-off
     </b>
     . In such a scenario,
     <b>
      asymmetric thrust would be minimal or non-existent
     </b>
     , making the aircraft\x92s attitude appear otherwise stable in its descent.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Further supporting this theory are:
     <ul>
      <li>
       <b>
        Eyewitness reports of a loud bang
       </b>
       , possibly indicating an engine failure.
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       A
       <b>
        mayday call
       </b>
       reportedly made by the crew.
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       The
       <b>
        audible presence of the RAT
       </b>
       in the video, suggesting a complete loss of engine-driven electrical and hydraulic systems.
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       The
       <b>
        noticeable absence of typical engine noise
       </b>
       , supporting the hypothesis of dual engine failure.
       <br/>
      </li>
     </ul>
     This scenario would offer a tragically plausible explanation for the aircraft\x92s behavior and the observed configuration in its final moments. Of course, the

     Unfortunately this is my first post here. I wanted to upload the frame for all to see but the forum is restricting me from doing this until I reach 8 posts. I can't link to it via a URL either. I studied a frame from the very start of the video, just as the full aircraft enters view and expanded it by 400% allowing me to see the position of the MLG doors).

  I have no knowledge about 787, but every landing gear system I\x92ve worked with did not sequence Left and Right MLG to retract and extend with each other. In fact it is typical for left and right side to move at slightly different speed due to different friction etc. Retraction assymmetry is probably not a clue to this mystery.

     Interested observer here, nothing more; with a question:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     If the mayday call has been reported correctly, it states: \x91Mayday! No thrust. Losing power. Cannot lift.\x92
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Is the term \x91Cannot lift\x92 standard comms for lack of climb rate/stall? If not, it strikes me that the transcript is incomplete, either due to loss of comms, inaudibility, or even just bad reporting.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     \x91Cannot lift gear\x92?
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Perhaps the phrase \x93Losing power\x93 refers to electrical power so following your line of thought the mayday call might be an accurate description of what they are experiencing I.e. no thrust, failing electrics and can\x92t raise the landing gear.

  Combining all the bits and pieces of info from this thread so far, IMO we can theoretically sequence it thus using the video from the left:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  00:18 Rotation. Normal takeoff config.
  <br/>
  00:24 Gear up starts. per Raffael with FF.
  <br/>
  ......... FR24 ADSB last transmission (71ft, 172kt) just before runway threshold. Matches with video aircraft altitude at 1/2 wingspan.
  <br/>
  ......... ? Full power flameout leaves N2 ~ 60%; Airspeed &lt; 200k so N2 will decay to 15% in 8-10s?
  <br/>
  ......... ? Takeoff EGT of 900C needs 25-35s to fall below 250C ?
  <br/>
  00:27 Gear up stops. per Raffael with FF. Bogies tilted.
  <br/>
  ......... ? APU starts. 20-55s to 95%N?
  <br/>
  ......... Per 787 dual-engine fail/stall memory items, PM initiates Fuel Cutoff and Run.
  <br/>
  00:28 Visible loss of thrust. Alt ~ 200ft using aircraft wingspan as measure.
  <br/>
  ......... Matches with eyewitness "within 5-10s ... it was stuck in the air".
  <br/>
  ......... Per 787 dual-engine fail/stall memory items, PM initiates RAT Switch for 1s. Whether auto or manual, the RAT initiates.
  <br/>
  ......... RAT "bang" heard by survivor
  <br/>
  ......... RAT coming online accounts for eyewitness "lights started flickering green and white".
  <br/>
  ......... Per 787 QRH below 1000ft, PF makes no change to Main Landing Gear and flaps, aircraft pointed straight for best glide.
  <br/>
  00:31 Descending visibly, somewhere beyond the runway threshold. Alt ~ 200ft using aircraft wingspan as measure.
  <br/>
  ......... ? Because EGT &gt; 250C FADEC blocks fuel (T-HOT hot restart inhibit?) so no relight though N2 &gt; 15% ?
  <br/>
  ......... 787 glide ratio between 16:1 to 25:1 with MLG down, Flaps 5. About 15-20s and 3-5000ft of glide from 200ft?
  <br/>
  ......... Some flap accounts for the ground pictures.
  <br/>
  00:34 ? N2 has presumably decayed to 15%, FADEC flips to X-START: airspeed outside envelope? No hope of relight now.
  <br/>
  ......... PM/PF transmits Mayday?
  <br/>
  ......... Video showing RAT deployed.
  <br/>
  00:46 APU reaches some fraction of 95%N (APU sound accounting for survivor's perception of thrust?).
  <br/>
  00:48 Impact. 4200ft from descent start, 3990ft from airport boundary road. 17s from visible descent start.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  if this is a valid sequence, the only remaining question is why the dual-engine failure at ~200ft agl?
  <br/>
  <br/>

     Couldn't agree more - never understood this - got to say, calling a mayday seconds into an event (particularly when still down in the dirt) does my head in - nobody is coming up to help. I think you need to keep the focus completely on the task at hand. In an emergency, external distractions destroy checklist SOPs, crew coordination etc etc - I try and keep ATC, company maintenance, etc etc disruptions out of the cockpit until everything is under control.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Who says they were down in the dirt? The only reports of the ATC call I&rsquo;ve seen so far have been via news sources. However, with a critically malfunctioning aircraft so soon after takeoff, you don&rsquo;t think it understandable a quick Mayday at Captain&rsquo;s prerogative might have been understandable even if not SOP if a crash appears imminent? They weren&rsquo;t asking for a vector or FL. No-one may have been able to &ldquo;come and help&rdquo;, but they had seconds to react or try to initiate a TOGA. My sincere sympathies are with the two heads in the pointy end of the plane who had precious little time to do anything with their rapidly sinking ship before total disaster.

  Narrow body Airbus training Captain here, two comments:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From the thread it is assumed the Co-Pilot was Pilot Not Flying. Are we sure who was Pilot Flying and who was Pilot Not Flying? (Or whatever nomenclature Air India uses for those positions)
  <br/>
  What is Air India&rsquo;s cockpit culture. Does the Captain always fly the first leg of a trip? Are we sure the Mayday call was made by the Co-Pilot? (I would believe it was even if the Co-Pilot had made the takeoff as when everything went sideways the Captain most likely would have taken the controls)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Things went bad almost immediately after takeoff, ie at virtually the point where the airplane shifts from ground mode to flight mode. I am unfamiliar with the 787. Is there anything in the litany of the things which take place during that transition which could have malfunctioned to cause or contribute to this tragedy?

     I agree it is helpful to seek a consensus on some of these matters.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The most productive responses would be along the lines of:-
     <br/>
     (1) I too have read all previous posts and agree that your summary reflects the current consensus,
     <br/>
     (2) I too have read all previous posts and agree your summary reflects the consensus
     <i>
      HOWEVER
     </i>
     I challenge that consensus because... [ [i]EITHER (a) reference to previous post that merits greater credence,
     <i>
      OR
     </i>
     (b) new evidence supplied],
     <br/>
     (3) I too have read all previous posts but I do NOT agree your summary reflects the consensus [explanation required].
     <br/>
     <br/>
     It is not necessary for everyone who thinks (1) to say it (although some initial feedback would be useful!). However, if any of the more experienced and informed PPRuNers are thinking either (2) or (3) then it would be instructive to hear that.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     FWIW, yours strikes me as a reasonable summary of the best consensus I have been able to discern (as of ~30 minutes ago). There are multiple caveats to each line item, but I presume you've deliberately left those out for the sake of readability, so I'll do the same!
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The only comments I would add are:-
     <br/>
     <br/>
     - It's a stretch to say the RAT is seen or heard "conclusively". Doubts have been expressed about the video quality and there are dissenting views regarding the audio. If a few more people were able to wade in on the audio point in particular, this could be very beneficial in moving the discussion forward because the presence or otherwise of the RAT is significant to several competing theories.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     - On the subject of audio, I am surprised there has not been more discussion regarding engine noise. In the primary eye witness video the (alleged) RAT can be heard distinctly, as can the sounds of distant impact. If the engines were working as expected when overflying the camera and then flying directly away from it, do we really not think the engine noise would be more conclusive, i.e. louder (notwithstanding quiet engines and derated takeoffs)?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Whichever way readers are leaning in the flaps versus power loss debate, surely these two points are pivotal, and we have actual evidence available to discuss?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     - Gear bogies: I'm not sure a consensus has yet been reached regarding the angle of the bogies. (I am not personally qualified to comment on this - I am purely saying I don't see a clear consensus just yet among those who are)
     <br/>
     <br/>
     - Mayday call: I don't recall seeing a confirmed source for the widely reported mayday. Others have brought this up in the thread but nobody appears to be able to confirm one way or the other. If accurate, its contents are informative. Am I right to presume that you have left it out of your summary due to a lack of confirmation?
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I must agree with you Pip. Regarding the following points:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - The bogie could be explained by the Flap/Slat priority valve giving priority to the flaps if the PM suddenly realised his mistake and quickly put the flap lever back to the TO position and then selected the gear lever to UP. Those systems are both heavy hitters and would\x92ve sucked the life out of the CTR hydraulic system pumps.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - There is no way loss of AC (alleged RAT deployment) could've caused a spool down of both engines. Think QF A380 incident in SIN - The entire #1 engine wiring harness in the wing was completely severed and yet it continued (by design) to run at its previous thrust setting. They had to shut it down using a fire truck!
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - History and design would dictate that a big 180 minutes ETOP\x92s twin such as the 787 having a dual engine failure or significant power loss at such a critical phase of flight would be a billion to one chance at best. Only the Airbus A400 had a software issue causing all 4 engine fuel shutoff valves to close causing it to crash killing the flight test crew - But this was during its development and flt testing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - Wide body twin\x92s delivering in the region of 60,000 to 115,000 lbs of thrust at TO rarely , if at all, flame out from multiple bird strike(s) like the baby Bus\x92s and Boeing\x92s. If anyone has seen the frozen chickens at TO power video would know what I\x92m talking about. And the Fan Blade being \x91blown off\x92 as well. In both cases the engine was was able to maintain full TOGA thrust for significantly longer than the AI aircraft.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it\x92s early days and anything could happen. And nothing surprises me anymore.

  There should not be a max pre-start EGT limit in-flight - that should only occur on the ground for a pilot-initiated Autostart where the starting EGT redlines are lower than for in-flight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In-flight, the Autorelight function should attempt to restart the engine as soon as a flameout is detected, and for an engine flaming out at high power it might catch it before it even goes sub-idle.  Generally, Autorelight will continue attempting until some cutoff N2 at which time it will stop attempting, or if the pilot move the fuel switch to Cutoff.  And while the EEC is still powered (via its own PMA) down to roughly 10% N2, the ignition exciters required for Autorelight do get their power from the airplane.

  Interesting to note that this report says pilot's mayday consisted only of 2 words "mayday, mayday", with no response to the ATC request for further reply. I have seen this quoted elsewhere now in mainstream media. I will leave others to formulate their own theories in response to this report. It seems popular to do so.

  What concerns me a little bit is if indeed AC power is lost, would the suction feed inlets in the wing tanks provide enough fuel flow to maintain TO thrust?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I know the system is designed to achieve this in a situation where all of the AC powered boost pumps are lost. But what about in a real situation...
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Could this cause a degradation of thrust? Even the slightest decrease..

  And if the Captain(?) mentioned power loss in his Mayday. Was he referring to electrical power loss?

  Can anyone familiar with the 787 built in overspeed protections comment on what could possibly override a pilots TOGA button command or fire walling the throttles?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I am presuming that at some point just prior to the mayday call the pilots would have just commanded \x91full\x92 thrust and received no or a significantly mild response.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I don\x92t think fuel contamination, birds or anything else external to the aircraft affected this crash. There is no evidence of it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  could some combination of already MEL items and one or more faulty inputs to the computers cause the aircraft to \x91protect\x92 itself into the ground? Regardless of throttle position?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I am thinking - ground/air logic, faulty airspeed sense, faulty AoA sense or other.

  At this point in time, I'm not sure we can rely on what was reportedly said in the mayday call. There are conflicting reports about what was actually said, even before we get on to transposition / interpretation of the contents - see, for example, Auldlassie's recent post (which may have crossed with your own) - and I still haven't seen a reliable source offered up for the original transcript.

  There is at least one other. RTO? Who was flying. At V1 the tension can be too much for an inexperienced FO who is flying. The mayday may have been spoken by the FO, after Captain tried to snatch controls back. It would explain an inexperienced left hand on the levers, and a non concert close of the throttle(s)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Unless....Captain was guarding the throttles, Initiated abort, and rethinks. Engines run, and run, and run.... They die of thirst.

  I agree.  It is intriguing that we have none of the radio communication released.  As a result, we do not have confirmation of what was actually said during the Mayday call, and no ability to deduce who was the PF and PM.
