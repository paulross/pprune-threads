     Maybe both engines didn't shut down absolutely sychronously. In the fly-by video a bit later not even a little bit asymmetry is visible. The rudder is straight and no bank whatsoever. That would also explain why the yaw is very small - a second later the other engine had failed as well.

  Engines generally deliver hydraulics while running down, as they operate down to a much lower speed than the generators do. Useful flight control power might be available from windmilling alone (hence why the 747 didn't have a RAT until the -8). That's subject to similar speed issues to the RAT but the engines have much more inertia. The Virgin Atlantic 024 report (A340 partial-gear-up landing at Heathrow) notes an expected 25-30 seconds of useful hydraulics after engine shutdown.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This doesn't apply if the pumps are depressurised by a fire handle, or to allow easier engine relight.

  Very subjective, and I agree it it could look like a slotted gap between the wing and flaps, except the shadow is confined to exactly where that spoiler pair is located. You don't see it where the rest of the flap is. It would be good to hear other opinions about what we are

  I don't understand your point here. The RAT hydraulic powers very specific flight controls like the stab, rudder, outboard ailerons and one specific pair of spoilers - the inboard most spoilers. Have a look at this schematic (at 3:55) youtu.be/DFbOLNduutI?si=siPnQ9oHMbLgp64K&amp;t=235 (not publishing link as it fills the frame). The spoiler pair I mentioned above (visible in the video) are only powered by L hydraulics and electrical. Assuming L hydraulics was lost by dual engine failure, then this spoiler pair can only have been electrically powered...hence the conclusion it's either powered electrically by the Battery or electrically powered by the RAT. That spoiler pair is not connected to the RAT hydraulics.

     One thing that just came to my mind: We are scratching our heads why that happened after the type is in service for almost 15 years with millions of flight hours and surely hundred thousands of T/Os and landings.
     <br/>
     What if it takes something to be worn/used after many years to get that kind of failure? The AI 787 was 11 years old. We have been discussing the fuel switches, but there are thousands of other parts that might contribute to such a failure in connection with some other problem.

  With such high redundancies and a large degree of isolation between the engines, if it was indeed a simultaneous dual-engine shutdown, we don\x92t know of a single hardware component that could have worn out and caused it (as far as I know)

  Before this accident occurred, Boeing whistleblowers were in fact reporting that planes were leaving the line, entering service with defects (including swarf) that would cause accidents many years later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The TWA 800 airframe was 25 years old at the time of the accident, where arced wiring was implicated in that crash. In the aftermath, industry-wide sampling of aircraft found cracked insulation on wiring, non-factory swarf added by follow-on maintenance, instances where wiring had been re-routed or manipulated in a manner that placed increased strain on looms, etc. Of course the problem with wiring-related problems is that they can produce faults that no engineer could have foreseen or have developed countermeasures for.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Not to be an alarmist, but much has been written about wiring issues on the aging fleet. I tend to believe that maintenance people in earlier generations were more conscientious about their work, where now more than ever corners are cut (beginning at the factory).

     Looking at water in the fuel tank: It's hard to believe that there was enough much water in the center fuel tank to stop both engines. On the day of the crash VT-ANB only flew DEL-AMD, a 1h flight that did not use the center fuel tank. However, the day before the plane came in from CDG with 9h of flight time. That flight would surely have used the center fuel tank. That means a large amount of water would have accumulated in the center fuel tank during just one day and two sectors.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  The centre tank would have been used up first, so the tank would have been down to undrainables plus whatever is left when switched over. A check of the weather at each previous sector's descent would be worthwhile to see how much water, in all its forms, could have been taken in the centre tank vent. The ejector pump should have emulsified this water it it was doing its job properly.

     Sorry but that doesn't really make sense. Once the power failed and all pumps are off where is the point of switching of the center fuel pumps off? Without power they aren't running anyways.
     <br/>
     Furthermore the preference of the center tank while it's filled is just by the higher fuel pressure those center pumps deliver. There is no valve that controls that, which might be triggered by switching off pumps.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Just for me to understand: How would you shut off the engine driven pumps if there is no electrical connection whatsoever? If there is a "powered" valve, wouldn't this (also) cut fuel suppy in case of a complete electrical failure?

     That doesn\x92t make sense at all. 53% would be around 53t which is reasonable for that flight.
     <br/>
     A full fuel load of 100t would have brought them by far over the MTOM as there is only around 8t of load left with full fuel of 100t. My guess with 242 POB and some baggage would be at least around 24t of load. Furthermore the fuel burn for tankering almost 50t for 9h would be enormous.

  Multiple sources, including BBC, have quoted Amit Shah, Home Affairs Minister, as saying the plane had 100 tonnes of fuel on board. This seems to stem from a direct quote from Shah, in which it is reported he said:

     The plane carried almost 1,25,000 litres of fuel, and due to the high temperature, there was no chance of saving anyone.
    </span>
   </div>
  </div>
  Using a rough approximation of 0.8kg = 1l leads to the 100t figure. Plenty of other sources for that 1.25 lakh litres fuel quote, including Times of India:
  <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/air-india-plane-crash-blaze-left-no-chance-of-rescue-says-amit-shah/articleshow/121815339.cms" target="_blank">
   https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/.../121815339.cms
  </a>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I have no idea if he actually knew how much fuel was on board, or whether he'd simply been told it was "full" and somebody had looked up the capacity (126k litres) and he then quoted that "full" number. Or whether, in fact, there was an excess of fuel. But since that seems so far the only public statement on fuel load, it shouldn't just be dismissed out of hand.

     I ask because when I look for info about FADECs generally and FADEC 3 more specifically, I find this kind of documentation (notice the mention of FADECs in the lower left corner):
     <br/>
     ... which is part of a larger Powerpoint presentation by Ansys, explaining that these products are developed with SCADE development workbench, generating either Ada or C code, and that the resulting code runs under a microkernel realtime operating system:
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  First off I should note that what I wrote is a massive oversimplification. I'd expect that neat metal box with the nice rugged connectors that Safran shows on their homepage to contain an ungodly mess of microcontrollers, ICs for signal conditioning, the FPGAs I mentioned and components that are well beyond my understanding of electronics. But from personal experience with a certain aircraft related company operating in Munich I can tell you that marketing level slides like you showed are so far removed from the technical reality that they might as well be fan-fic.

     Now, obviously enough, a CPU can be embedded in an application-specific FPGA, but it would still execute machine code. And from my experience in other embedded systems development, current CISC or RISC CPUs have more than enough computation power to implement command and control on a modern turbofan.
    </div>
   </div>

  I agree with your observation that current microcontrollers are more than capable enough of dealing with these types of real time computation, but keep in mind that the Boeing 787, and thus its FADEC, had its first flight in 2009. Back then I would be rather more careful with that statement. Mostly because I would have just started my Computer Science Degree at the time XD
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But maybe I should explain how I've arrived at the post above. I've basically spent the past few days on and off scavenging anything I could find on the 787 FADEC specifically. It was mentioned in this thread or the old one that the 787 uses the Safran FADEC 3, so my primary jumping off point was the Safran website and the information available on it. That plus a couple of press releases namely by Actel about their
  <span style="color:rgba(0,0,0,0.75)">
   flash-based ProASIC3 and ProASICPLUS FPGAs was the evidence I used to arrive at my conclusions above. I can't for the life of me find the quote about the dual signal conditioning FPGAs anymore, but they are in there as far as I can tell.
  </span>
  <br/>
  Overall information on the actual inner workings of these things are so sparse that outside of a few patents (keyword: configurable CPU) I was hard pressed to find anything at all to be honest. This all not being helped by me now finding references to my own post, thus having created my very own Woozle. Hooray.

     Whilst you\x92re right to highlight the type of software in a FADEC, it should also be recalled that after the dual uncommanded engine shutdown event on the Baltic CS300, the FAA mandated updated FADEC software for all of a family of P&amp;W engines. FADEC s/w can contain what we\x92d call bugs (whether they\x92re mistakes of coding or mistakes of logic in the design assumptions).

  I have only looked into the Safran FADEC 3 used on the 787 with the
  <span style="color:#1b1d27">
   GEnx-1B engine. The system was very innovative for its time and uses technology not previously used on FADECs to my knowledge. Even saying that, this could be one of those "technically true" kind of statements. My intention was to highlight that due to the totality of the processes and architectural style of these types of computational device the typical kind of "software error" or "bug" was basically impossible and that we'd be looking at something way further back with implications for the base requirements. I merely want to correct the implied misconceptions about the "software" being used here. As I said, FPGAs are just very different kinds of beasts.

     "it is basically impossible for a "bug" to exist in this system." This is not my experience.There are a lot of bugs in hardware and FPGAs. The guys doing this are real experts and bugs are less common than in software. But they do exist and they can be difficult to reproduce and subtle to diagnose. For someone new to FPGA it can be very intimidating because everything is parallel. It requires a different way of thinking. You can execute 1000 instructions simultaneously.Then various tricks to speed things up or reduce glitches add complexity. For example you may want to count in gray code or one hot instead of binary. Writing bug free FPGA code is very challenging. We cannot assume the FPGA code is free of bugs.
    </div>
   </div>

  I half agree and half disagree. Obviously I shouldn't have stated an absolute because, yes, it is possible despite multiple layers of engineering coordination that an error occurs at one step or another and is not caught by the multiple layers of checking. My point is that even in normal development FPGAs are well known to be bug resistant due to the way they are programmed. In general we create the logic condition tables using software which then translates our table into an actual FPGA configuration. This process is obviously not immune to faults but highly resistant and most importantly: Can easily be simulated.
  <br/>
  Now, in normal "everyday" usecases I'd fully agree with you, but in case of the FADEC we're talking about an FPGA with logic condition tables where every line is likely to have its own separate binder of engineering notes, discussions and recommendations. It is there where any "error" or "bug" is most likely to reside by a considerable margin.

     I have developed embedded systems for more than 20 years - most in real time applications. I wouldn\x92t expect FPGAs in such systems. As mentioned before modern microcontrollers can easily handle loads like that in a real time environment with guaranteed response times.

  They were, and continue to be, a valid and reliable technology for this type of application especially before the extreme proliferation of consumer microelectronics in the last 20 years. The Safran FADEC 3 was designed at basically the same time as the first iPhone. And boy do I feel old now.

     Now, I am sure that the state of the art has moved on a lot since I was heavily involved in this sort of engineering but I can say that when my colleagues were prototyping ASICs (which are application specific devices that are not programmable like an FPGA) using FPGAs because it can be reprogrammed to cure bugs found in the code that created it I am absolutely sure that it is possible for a latent bug to exist in what has been built despite extensive testing being carried out. I well remember sitting down with an FPGA designer and a software engineer and showing them a situation where one of my radio devices was not being commanded to transmit, they refused to believe me until we captured their output signals in the failed state and I was thus able to prove to them that it was their logic and code that was failing and that my radio system was fully working except it couldn't possibly transmit when its enable line was inactive.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I would therefore never state that an FPGA-based FADEC is infallible. The devil will be in the detail of the functions contained within the devices and how they interact with each other and how the original logical functions are described and specified and then coded and checked for logical errors before getting on to the actual physical reality of the FPGA manufacturer's design and development system that bolts on to the back of the source code. If the FPGA devices are being pushed anywhere near the edge of their performance envelope, just like an aircraft things can go wrong. If a design begins with a device that is only just large enough in terms of how many logic blocks and routing channels are available for the logic required it's almost a certainty that development will take it to this area of its performance and a lot of tweaking may be needed which means that even more testing will be needed to be reasonable sure that it does what it is supposed to.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I realize that my post is a massive simplification of the topic, considering the intricate details that are simply unknown to the general public in a system as complex as a FADEC I certainly agree that things can go wrong. What I wanted to point out is the reliability of the last steps versus the design and requirements engineering phase. In general software development bugs will happen at any stage with basically equal likelihood. Given the way the standard processes around FPGA development alone would influence this probability towards the design and requirements engineering stage and then combining it with how it is handled in the Aerospace Sector I felt it was justifiable to state the extreme mismatch in probabilities of error the way I did. With the system being in operation for this length of time I do still feel comfortable with my original statement although I would now decorate it with a little * for the reasons mentioned by you and others.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the end I hope it was useful for understanding where the reluctance of apportioning blame to these systems originates and &ZeroWidthSpace;&ZeroWidthSpace;&ZeroWidthSpace;&ZeroWidthSpace;at the same time talk about some pretty nifty tech that I know few Software Engineers will ever deal with in their entire career. I do still find the idea of a fault (with the understanding above of where that fault originates) in the FADEC a convincing possibility, it's merely the nature and location of that fault that I felt could benefit from some more specifics in regards to the nature of how they were most likely to actually happen. I would love to actually hear more about how the FADEC 3 is structured internally and which components it uses, but I suspect that those who know are under NDA.

  Probably just a transport dolly for moving the tank skin between processes.  This looks more like the mould tool in front of the autoclave.
