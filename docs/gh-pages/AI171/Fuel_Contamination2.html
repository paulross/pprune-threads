  Fuel guy here. I've been "sitting on my hands" as requested by the mods but I will bite on that. Because dual engine failure is a "common mode fault" contamination is one of simplest explanations. Forget wax, think sediment, water or misfuelling. The only reason this has been discounted in favour of an electromechanical/software fault is that there is no yaw, i.e. both engines ran down at the same time at more or less the same rate, and would have to have been fed from the same tank (so the contaminated fuel reaches the engines at EXACTLY the same time on each side - is that even possible?). Its a stretch but I suppose it is possible, however the retention samples should have been tested by now. I would be interested in confirmation that they were taken and tested. I would also want to know if there is a "hot hydrant" system at AMD or if there are bowsers and if any maintenance had been done (think Cathay at Surabaya). But honestly, the fuel supply chain is usually rigorous...[edit: I have just seen a Reddit post pointing to a major construction project involving the fuelling facilities at Ahmedabad...will try to find out more...]

  I'm not suggesting you are wrong wheelsright, my post to you was in response to posts I have made about potential fuel contamination, being removed. A central point of failure is more likely than the simultaneous shutdown by systems on two separate engines at the point at which the aircraft left the ground. If what is being speculated on is possible then all ETOPs approval should be removed and the engine manufacturers told to start again.

     The excellent #724 post by user989 really should be seen as the defining statement on what is currently known.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I&rsquo;d like to add a complimentary test to user989&rsquo;s logic on TCMA faults.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Regardless of whether the &lsquo;aircraft on ground&rsquo; signal was incorrect after rotation it would have been correct during the takeoff roll. IF there was an unrevealed fault in a thrust lever position signal THEN why didn&rsquo;t TCMA activate during taxiing or the takeoff roll?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Such a fault occurring spontaneously in just the few seconds after rotation is way way down the probability table. Such a fault occurring spontaneously on both separate (think ETOPS) engine control systems is surely vanishingly unlikely.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     They may be out there but you&rsquo;d have to ask if TCMA is implicated where are the lower consequence precursor events in the 787 fleet? These might be spurious TCMA action on one engine or faults with &lsquo;aircraft on ground&rsquo; found during maintenance or engines not responding to thrust lever position and so on.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Change Analysis would ask what happened differently in the few seconds after rotation on this flight that separates it from all other 787 takeoffs and why at that particular time ?The interim report will provide some answers until then please let&rsquo;s confine this thread to fact based technical discussion and debate.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Re-reading this I did briefly consider suggesting engine overshoot of thrust lever positions and FADEC shut down on N1 overspeed but that leaves a lot of WHY and WHY both engines questions so I dismissed it.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Yours is very good logic, as far as it goes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But I'd posit these points (without making any assertions about the probabilities of the scenarios).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There is a flaw in the logic arising from the categorical assertion that the 'aircraft on ground' signal 'would have been correct' during the take off roll: "Regardless of whether the &lsquo;aircraft on ground&rsquo; signal was incorrect after rotation it would have been correct during the takeoff roll. IF there was an unrevealed fault in a thrust lever position signal THEN why didn&rsquo;t TCMA activate during taxiing or the takeoff roll?"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  What IF the 'aircraft on ground' signal into the TCMA systems was INcorrect during taxi and the take off roll, thus disabling the TCMA functionality during that phase of the flight, making no difference in any event because the engines were operating normally in accordance with the thrust lever settings? In that case, any error in, for example, the thrust lever signals and engine signals to the TCMAs would not have had any consequence. Maybe the signal reversed and stayed INcorrect after take-off. Of course, that's why we are all craving to find out from what source/s the TCMAs get the 'on ground/in air' input/s and what other systems use the same source/s.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And I reiterate the point that the TCMA is "just software". I haven't seen anyone dispute the suggestion that the thing 'common' to all 4 channels of the TCMA is 4 copies of software.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the earlier thread there was a statement about the 'obsession' of some with TCMA. I'm not 'obsessed' with it, but confess a prejudice towards trying to find a cause that is not a result of crew error. I therefore also have an attraction towards fuel contamination, but have difficulty in believing that fuel contamination would result in such a 'clean', immediate and simultaneous reduction in thrust from both engines after they'd operated normally during the take off roll.

  All of which has been discussed and for the wing vortices and the fuel feed has been explained quite comprehensively, along with the fuel cut offs: have you not read these posts only made recently?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I repeat, do

  post repeats of discussions already had unless there is something of value which may change or enhance previous posts. This is a prime example of a post which should be vetted and dismissed before pressing Submit Reply 🙈

     Some assumed numbers about normal biotreatment.
     <br/>
     <a href="https://www.biobor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Biobor-JF-Spec-Sheet-TDS-Aviation-IATA.pdf" target="_blank">
      https://www.biobor.com/wp-content/up...ation-IATA.pdf
     </a>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     If we assume 50 tonnes fuel load a 100ppmw biotreatment will be 5kg of biocide total in all tanks.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The GEnx-1B will burn about 4,5kg/s fuel each on a take off run (give or take a bit) so 9kg/s in both donks for about 20s until rotate.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     So the total nominal biocide dose could be pumped in about half a second through both engines on take off power if it where not mixed at all and arrives in both engines at the same time.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     This gives you an idea that with the nominal amount of biocide dose not much could have happened. If biocide is the source of this dual EFATO than an extreme overdose in addition to wrong application preventing mixture with the fuel had to be the case.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  This sounds convincing, but I have read
  <a href="https://jtsb.mlit.go.jp/eng-air_report/VHVKJ.pdf" target="_blank">
   the investigation report on Jetstar Airways serious incident (VHVKJ)
  </a>
  with great attention, and if I understand it right, things may be a bit more subtle:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  First, the problem involves the valves (notably but not exclusively FMV and FSV), not the combustion of the product:
  <br/>
  <div style="margin:1rem; margin-top:0.3rem;">
   <div>
    <label>
     Quote:
    </label>
   </div>
   <div class="panel alt2" style="border:1px inset">
    It is highly probable that Residue primarily composed of magnesium salts accumulated in FMV spool and FSV spool, which meter engine combustion fuel, restricted movement of spools, caused inadequate fuel metering, thereby led to engine rpm oscillation that occurred from the first flight after conducting biocide treatment.
   </div>
  </div>
  Second, the doses apparently don't need to be that high to result in a problem. A x10 dose seems sufficient:
  <br/>
  <div style="margin:1rem; margin-top:0.3rem;">
   <div>
    <label>
     Quote:

   </div>
   <div class="panel alt2" style="border:1px inset">
    Investigation into similar cases revealed that there were six cases reported in which both engines could not start in twin engine aircraft, and one case each in which all engines could not start in four-engine aircraft and engine thrust could not be adjusted. Any of these cases were presumed to have been caused by concentration ratio of biocide (Kathon FP1.5) that was set at higher values (about 1,000 ppm) than specified ones during biocide treatments.
   </div>
  </div>
  Third, the main cause of the incident seems to be associated with magnesium salts dissolving in water instead of fuel:
  <br/>
  <div style="margin:1rem; margin-top:0.3rem;">
   <div>
    <label>
     Quote:
    </label>
   </div>
   <div class="panel alt2" style="border:1px inset">
    From the biocide test result, it is probable that Magnesium salts contained in biocide did not dissolve in fuel, but dissolved in water contained in fuel and were accumulated in spools as crystals through the engine fuel system.
   </div>
  </div>
  Fourth, and despite the report indicating that (
  <b>
   my bold
  </b>
  ) "In this serious incident, it is highly probable that, when the Aircraft was descending for landing, there occurred oscillation in rpm of each engine causing both engines to temporarily fall below idle
  <b>
   at separate times
  </b>
  because Residue primarily composed of magnesium salts accumulated in spools impeded movement of spools that involved in fuel metering of both engines.", it should be noted that the reported "rpm oscillations" of left and right engines were close to each other in time:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <img alt="" class="post_inline_image" src="https://cimg6.ibsrv.net/gimg/pprune.org-vbulletin/1498x424/engine_rpm_oscillations_left_9815b2033e52074b8f95cd991932e625d83cca93.png"/>
  <br/>
  <img alt="" class="post_inline_image" src="https://cimg7.ibsrv.net/gimg/pprune.org-vbulletin/1498x423/engine_rpm_oscillations_right_1940e9825fc3766fe9b224d8e965e14cf40d9e96.png"/>
  <br/>
  These "rpm oscillations", leading to substantial loss of thrust, could as well have occurred simultaneously, and 81 seconds (for the RH engine) is an awfully long time. According to the report, Kathon FP1.5 is not used anymore for biocide treatment, but another contributor (
  <b>

  </b>
  , who seems to be a petrol specialist)
  <a href="https://www.pprune.org/accidents-close-calls/666581-air-india-ahmedabad-accident-12th-june-2025-part-2-a-11.html#post11904311" target="_blank">
   suggested that other products may have similar effects
  </a>
  .
  <br/>

  Therefore, regarding the case we are discussing at large (thanks again, mods!), I think we shouldn't overlook the hypothesis of fuel contamination by biocide, since it is a single point of failure (among a very limited number of SPoFs) from a system analysis point of view.

  I read the whole threads, keeping my hands on the mousewheel so far since I'm not a pilot, just a EE / safety / systems engineer.
  <br/>
  The hamsterwheel ist spinning a lot here, and of course it could be anything including some VHDL FPGA code line or a broken RAM cell in a cheap memory bar within the computer it was compiled with. Anything is possible, but to be honest: development processes, if followed, are usually pushing the probability to a level where it becomes pure theory. BOSCH uses FPGA+\xb5C on the brake control box of cars. They sold 100 millions of those, used 4000h each (car lifetime) without error, with less strict development process. Most errors are made on requirement level, not code.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also, so far there is no evidence I've seen regarding the 'chicken-egg' problem, did the engines fall below idle (fuel, stall...) and this caused an electrical blackout (-&gt; battery, RAT...) or did an EE problem cause the engines to reduce thrust (FADEC, SW bug...). And where is the common cause in all this?
  <br/>
  There has to be a systematic error common to both engines, an external failure affecting both or a dependent fault with one affecting the other within seconds. This is the only thing I think everyone agrees here. And I refuse to beleave the external failure or dependent fault was sitting in the cockpit.
  <br/>
  I think it is something not common to every aircraft type for the last 50 years.
  <br/>
  So I started searching and found a candidate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I read myself into the EE architecture of this unique 'bleed-less' design and it's megawatt powergrid since this is the part where I may be able to contribute (and I'm most curious about). Generators on the 787 are &gt;250kW instead of &lt;100kW each and there are two per engine instead of just one. In fact, they can go up to 516 kW and shear off the gearbox at &gt;2200Nm (equal to &gt;2 MW, per generator).
  <br/>

  <br/>
  So while on any other aircraft the generator is more like the dynamo on your bicycle, those generators are massive (x10).
  <br/>
  The gearbox is connected to the HP shaft (N2) on the GEnx. I learned from Wikipedia that RR moved this gearbox to the IP shaft on the Trend 1000. And RR is happy that the A330neo Trend 7000 uses bleed air and less load on the gearbox, since this maintains stability on the HP shaft at light load (also Wikipedia).
  <br/>
  Those generators are not in phase and frequency sync, or in other words: If you parallel them, they fight each other, it's like a short. They will almost block if this is not handled by the control box if possible (or some melting fuse blows at some point).
  <br/>

   787 electrical system - variable frequency generators?
  </a>
  <br/>
  Somehow I find it hard to believe that they are not able to disturb the engines despite that everyone here so far is claiming that there is no way an electrical problem could influence them because FADEC has it's own supply. I read that one is sufficent to start the engine, usually both are used.
  <br/>
  In my mind I find lot's of ways this could influence both engines simultanously. If just the BTBs on the 230V grid got some humidity (hot, no AC, water cooling...) and went up in one big arc (I think they made them semiconductor relays, too).
  <br/>
  Could those gearboxes and engines handle 4500Nm / almost 5 MW on each HP shaft, applied within a fraction of a second without any problem?
  <br/>
  Or if the engines were in a condition not far from compressor stall, one was stalling and 400kW load jumped from one engines generators to the other...
  <br/>
  I did some rough estimation and one of the generators could push N2 below idle in a second or less without fuel just with its normal 250kW load (just inertia).
  <br/>
  This is one point which is unique to this airplane model, so maybe worth a closer look.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I know that those engines are burning at &gt;100MW at full power, but how fragile in the balance between compressor load and this one turbine stage on the HP shaft / N2, without the inertia of a 2.8 meter fan? This is just out of my background, any thermodynamic expert here?
  <br/>
  Of course I also have no insight in SW and communication within the control boxes, how much they are talking to each other, delaying/ramping load redistribution etc. If FADEC recognizes a flameout, could it instantly command the generators to cut the load, even above idle rpm?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I would assume that some fuel contamination, valve blockade, even compressor stall would pop up slower. But such a generator could kick in within milliseconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As a safety guy I learned that one tends to look first at things one is familiar with (SW, HW, mechanics, pilot behaviour, maintainance, depending on one's profession) and in the end it's often the interface and dependent faults within which are not carefully considered (e.g. takeoff situation vs. thermodynamics vs. mechanics vs. power generation vs. humidity vs. generator control...) together with transient behaviour. It was the same with MCAS (safety culture vs. pilot training vs. SW design (repeated action) vs. single AOA input vs. bird strike probability close to ground vs. trim loading/blockade vs. stickshaker noise/distraction).
  <br/>
  In fact, I was trying to find information on all those systems and directly found slides on how the engines and generators could be simulated and the power grid tested in a HIL (hardware in the loop) environment. My experience from automotive is that such simulated environments are often far from reality and HIL environment programming finished after the product is already at the customer. But of course its far easier and cheaper to apply and test faults there. But then, some programmer programms what he thinks the reaction of the engine would be.
  <br/>
  This 'bleed-less' design was some massive change in airplane EE architecture with hugh consequences on the whole airplane design and extremely hard to fully analyze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I'm just asking questions and hope that we all learn a lot and this was fully considered or just not an issue. It's just an aspect I found worth mentioning and not only spinning the wheel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  PS: I doubt it was TCMA. The air/ground decision is done in a different box, evaluating 5 inputs in a 1/3 and 1/2 decision according to this discussion. This is then safely sent to the FADEC (as one input) and combined with the thrust lever position and N2. But if the thrust lever position is sensed (redundant and direct) close to idle, you do not need TCMA or ground mode to expect reduced thrust.
