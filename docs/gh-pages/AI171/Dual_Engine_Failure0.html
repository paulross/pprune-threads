  Indian press seems to be running with reports of power loss, double engine failure. Not sure how accurate it is, but the video doesn't sound like a large jet a full power considering you can hear a lot of ambient noise around.  At the start of the video the body angle is definitely low, low like they are trying to stay unstalled, but then the nose rises as the ground approaches, as you would expect anyone to react.

  No speculation as to what caused the crash, but a couple of points. If there was an inadvertent retraction of flaps instead of gear, this could potentially be remedied by reselecting flaps promptly once recognised. Whether the startle factor would allow it is another thing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If the RAT is indeed out and there was some sort of powerplant issue, ie. double engine failure, I don't think I would be in a hurry to retract the gear either. In fact it may well have been put down again in that scenario.

  Regardless, awful footage to watch. RIP.

  True. We won\x92t know until the CVR and Flight Data recordings have been analysed. I think these will give a clear indication of what happened. The airport has reopened so I assume there\x92s no fuel contamination risk.

  Just to confirm.
  <br/>
  The 787 is an aircraft which likes to, performance wise, use all of the available runway for takeoff. Sometimes you can be sat in the 787 and as you are rolling down the runway, you start wondering if Rotate has been called or not. It loves taking up all of the runway.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nevertheless, there are some interesting speculations over on X. One guy even claimed the Captain was in the lavatory during the accident...
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many people have noted what appears to be the RAT deployed in the video footage suggesting dual engine failure. Possible wrong engine shutdown? But who diagnoses and actions an engine failure and shutdown below 400ft?

  You certainly should try that\x92s for sure. ANC and all that good stuff! In a panic it certainly is possible to just pull the wrong one. I\x92m not saying that\x92s what\x92s happened, to me it seems like dual engine failure, practically simultaneously.

  No the plane barely took off the runway, low power setting/bad flaps. Unless you are saying a double engine failure before take off but seriously how likely is that? It's much more plausible to mess up the take off settings we have seen it many times before. But I think we will find out soon, no need to speculate too much.

  Well, the certainly sound like they are working; failed engines sound different. No sign of smoke or damage either.

  Doesn't work like that, and significant logical errors have been made on that basis in the past. The chances of simultaneous

   independent
  </i>
  engine failure might be a trillion to one, being a million million.

  &ZeroWidthSpace;&ZeroWidthSpace;&ZeroWidthSpace;&ZeroWidthSpace;&ZeroWidthSpace;

  But failure is often not independent. Hit a flock of birds with both engines, run out of good fuel, etc etc - then the probability is primarily that of the root event.

     nothing was normal the plane rotated right at the end of the runway far too late and barely climbed at all for 10 seconds before falling 20 seconds and finally crashing 30 seconds after take off.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The most obvious answer is low power/flaps setting if the engines were weird they would have probably aborted take off. Bird strike/engine issue during take off roll after v1? Super unlikely but never say never
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  An aircraft using derated thrust will use most of the runway to reach V1. It's not far too late. The initial climb looks normal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If the flaps weren't set then the aircraft would have accelerated on the runway faster, not slower. But I don't think the flaps were set wrong, or retracted early. The flaps appear extended in the video and the post crash photo. Why do you think a bird strike after V1 is unlikely? If you fly into a flock of birds a double engine failure is no less likely then a single failure. My initial thought watching the first video this lunchtime was power loss in both engines, probably bird strikes. I still think that.

  Both videos evidence a normal rotation and climb followed swiftly by an abrupt cessation of the climb. No sign of yaw. But an apparent catastrophic loss of thrust. To me this points to dual engine failure. Statistically the most likely cause would be bird strike. The flap/gear configurations are probably not causative.

  The theories concerning inadvertent flap retraction are not consistent with the apparent transcript from the mayday call made or rat deployment. In the first video that circulated, the engines can\x92t really be heard (certainly not producing any significant amount of thrust). If the aircraft was climbing out misconfigured, those engines would be screaming. Instead, all you can hear is the rat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Similarly - a bird strike, knocking out two engines simultaneously is a noisy/messy event and I would expect to see evidence of this occurring in both videos, and in the area at the point of ingestion. The engines don\x92t just roll back with a bird strike - they surge, smoke, bang and splutter. It would be very apparent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At this time, I think everything is pointing towards both engines simultaneously having their fuel feeds interrupted between V1 and Vr. CVR/FDR will be interesting.

     The theories concerning inadvertent flap retraction are not consistent with the apparent transcript from the mayday call made or rat deployment. In the first video that circulated, the engines can\x92t really be heard (certainly not producing any significant amount of thrust). If the aircraft was climbing out misconfigured, those engines would be screaming. Instead, all you can hear is the rat.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Similarly - a bird strike, knocking out two engines simultaneously is a noisy/messy event and I would expect to see evidence of this occurring in both videos, and in the area at the point of ingestion. The engines don\x92t just roll back with a bird strike - they surge, smoke, bang and splutter. It would be very apparent.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     At this time, I think everything is pointing towards both engines simultaneously having their fuel feeds interrupted between V1 and Vr. CVR/FDR will be interesting.

  The issue I have with the \x91mis-selected flaps up\x92 theory is that if PM had accidentally retracted flaps, I\x92d expect the PF to lower the nose, apply max thrust to try and accelerate by flying level or in a minimal descent. In this accident, the nose never seems to get lowered to decrease the AoA, in fact pitch increases just before it seems to stall. I\x92d also expect similar for an overweight takeoff, thrust or loadsheet error.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fact none of the above happened, coupled with the lack of landing gear coming up, makes me think they didn\x92t have thrust to play with.

     I hate to say it but it looks to me like a dual engine failure or both engine master switches set to off after take-off.
     <br/>
     Both situations are harrowing 😣

    Background
    <br/>
    In-service reports have been received from operators of the affected airplanes where the AFDS altitude hold ALT hold mode was erroneously engaged during takeoff. One recent event resulted in an unusually low initial rate of climb. Another recent event resulted in a slight descent after takeoff, triggering a ground proximity warning system (GPWS) &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Sink&rdquo; caution message. Once airborne, the flightcrews pushed the Take Off/Go Around (TO/GA) switch to restore proper pitch guidance. Review of flight data from the reported events showed the activation of ALT pitch mode prior to takeoff without the crew&rsquo;s recognition.
    <br/>
    --fast forward
    <br/>
    For 787s:
    <br/>
     Inadvertent selection of the Altitude Hold Switch on the MCP.
    <br/>
     Inadvertent selection of the FLCH, VS/FPA when the MCP selected altitude is within 20
    <br/>
    feet of the displayed barometric altitude.
    <br/>
     The Flight Director is ON with the Inertial Reference System (IRS) OFF (including during
    <br/>
    initiation of IRS alignment), and the MCP selected altitude is within 20 feet of the
    <br/>
    displayed barometric altitude.

  {there is more, this is just a taste, see the whole report for details}.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Would any of our 787 qualified pilots care to comment on this as it relates, or doesn't relate, to the aircraft's brief flight shown on the CCTV video?

  I strongly agree with you. Fuel Cross feed valve is an example.

     Any chance this was fuel contamination?

  That was my first thought. You don\x92t get a double engine failure for nothing else but that and maybe birds, but birds would have caused some trailing smoke or at least some visible signs on cctv at some point throughout the ingestion period.
