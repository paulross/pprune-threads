     Thank you for your service, you have a thankless job! And I do appreciate input from other aviation professionals such as those you mentioned, but SLF could somehow be rooted out? Reading one reasonable post is akin to unearthing a gold nugget!

  It is obvious to the Mod Team that there is an overwhelming amount of posts from PPRuNers new and old who have not read the thread nor used the Search function before bursting into print.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the sake of our sanity and personal time this thread is closed for a couple of hours to give you all time to actually read it before launching into your version of events.

  Hello posters,
  <br/>
  <br/>
  We mods are working away on this thread. To be honest, I cannot recall a recent thread with more discussion - which is what we're we for! Good!
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That said, I, and several other mods, have asked that posters "familiarize themselves" with the contents of the thread. Maybe read all of it, maybe read back a few days before posting. Has what you're thining to post as "new" information, already been presented and discussed (and perhaps dispositioned)? We mods have read most of the posts, so we're trying to stay on top of it, to give readers less to no nonsense to have to read through. We have asked some respects for the crew, particularly in regard of postulated intentional acts - just don't.... unless firm, credible (future) evidence opens this theme. We mods are clearing out such posts with no mercy, but it's still work, and other decent thoughts may get lost in the dustbin as a result (we very, very rarely edit out only a part of a post).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And yes, report posts which you really feel are not worthy here, we mods do consider every report. That said, how about
  <i>
   not making
  </i>
  report worthy posts! My [our] inboxes have been filled with report emails this time around.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  We eagerly promote good compliant [to PPRuNe rules] discussion, keeping posts within the guidelines makes it more enjoyable for everyone, and less work for your mod team - we really are trying to keep this place the professional pilot discussion you're looking for!
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thanks, Pilot DAR
  <br/>
  <br/>
  P.S. Please don't post AI generated crap, okay? (thanks for reminding me Tu.114)

  Again, this thread has become a Hamsterwheel of repetition and guesswork mixed in with nuggets of information and professionalism.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Until we have the time and ability to sort out which is which it will be closed.

  This is a new thread with a small selection of the contributions from the original Air India crash thread which is now closed. By no means comprehensive they give a grounding for further discussion here on PPRuNe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Please remember this is a Professional Pilots forum, and speculation by new signups, SLF and others will only be accepted if proven relevant and accurate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On a lighter note we achieved our highest number of viewers ever a couple of days ago, highlighting the interest that PPRuNe has as a source of factual information across the Forums. My sincere thanks to our regular members and to the Mod Team for their continued hard work behind the scenes üëç

  He has very wisely chosen his words carefully, read them literally!
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A few posters have sent pleading PM's asking why their post was deleted, while others remains. Please just go with the flow posters, and re read the quote above. The moderator's actions are final, and we don't have the time to personally justify moderation actions. This post, following on to Senior Pilot's and T28's post are a reminder of very general justification of moderator actions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This very sad event could touch on a troubling factor, it is not ruled out yet, neither authoritatively suggested. We, professional pilots, on a professional pilot website will give our colleagues the benefit of the doubt. If new
  <i>
   facts
  </i>
  come to light from an authoritative (certainly NOT A.I.) source, we will discuss them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There have been pleads from some to weed out newbie speculation posts, this thread is that! For PPRuNe it's not going to be to exclude non pilots, but this thread shows our effort to put very authoritative posters in the forefront.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moderating this thread has been a lot of work, we're doing our best. The event now has a big vacuum, waiting for the flight data recorder information to be formally released. Many of us have speculation, and it can only remain that until flight data recorder
  <i>
   facts
  </i>
  are publicly available to show what we really should be discussing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The best thing maybe just to hold your speculation, until you are commenting on known
  <i>
   facts
  </i>
  , and I'm confident that we will, when the time is right...
