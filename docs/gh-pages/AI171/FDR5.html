    On the evening of 24 June 2025, the team led by DG AAIB with technical members from AAIB and NTSB began the data extraction process. The Crash Protection Module (CPM) from the front black box was safely retrieved, and on 25 June, 2025, the memory module was successfully accessed and its data downloaded at the AAIB Lab.The analysis of CVR and FDR data is underway. These efforts aim to reconstruct the sequence of events leading to the accident and identify contributing factors to enhance aviation safety and prevent future occurrences.

     Not quite sure if this thread is open again or not.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I wanted to bring something up.
     <br/>
     Maybe I am out of touch, but the way we have talked about this accident, we have talked about it like it were doomed to be an unsurviveable high energy crash inferno.
     <br/>
     I, at least, have been guilty of having this picture in my mind.
     <br/>
     Wasn't this a, relatively speaking, a low energy impact scenario, comparable to Air France 269, SAS 751, BA038, or a number of other accidents including things like the hudson river event, which would have been somewhat surviveable except the impact with the buildings?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     There looks to be more open areas in close proximity to the accident site that are as big, 150-250 meters, or larger than what either of those others had available or at least used.
     <br/>
     There have been comments of the docile trajectory of the aircraft being a sign of pilots giving up, and letting automation take over of sorts, but in reality, could it be they just did exactly the same as the crew on BA038 or SAS 751? Except the lack of luck?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     In connection with this, why would the recorders be so damaged it has taken them weeks to access them. It seems that kind of impact should be well within the envolope for those designs.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     If out of bounds or order, please delete.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  The aircraft from the time they lost thrust to impact was probably less than 20 seconds. At a low energy state the best the crew could do was try and break the rate of descent. There was no opportunity to try and maneuver to the best landing site. As far as the FDR&rsquo;s it appears they functioned exactly as designed. The intense fire would badly damage the FDR boxes and associated electronics. The chip which is the component that is heavily protected so far seems just fine.

  In keeping with PilotDAR's request, here is some possibly useful information regarding the type of Flight Data Recorder (FDR) and Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) likely installed in the Air India B787 (using long names etc for those who may be unfamiliar with various acronyms).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The B787 was one of the first aircraft to receive a new type of FDR/CVR, known as an Enhanced Airborne Flight Recorder (EAFR). Some detail of the time may be found here:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <a href="https://www.flightglobal.com/boeing-787s-to-be-fitted-with-enhanced-data-recorders-/67970.article" target="_blank">

   https://www.militaryaerospace.com/po...for-boeing-787
  </a>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I don't believe it's absolutely confirmed yet but earlier posts (thank you
  <a href="https://www.pprune.org/members/105467-v1-ooops" rel="nofollow">
   V1... Ooops
  </a>
  <i>
   et al
  </i>
  ) indicated that the unit in question may be a  GE Aviation Model 3254F,
  <a href="https://www.geaerospace.com/sites/default/files/enhanced-aircraft-flight-recorder-3254F.pdf" target="_blank">
   the document here
  </a>
  gives some good detail, along with
  <a href="https://skybrary.aero/sites/default/files/bookshelf/2955.pdf" target="_blank">
   another

  doc from Skybrary that has some relevant information.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And

   this one
  </a>
  discusses more on the 'new' ARINC-767 protocol in use with these later units.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some broader background into ARINC's role in determining the standards applicable to aviation can be seen in this video. While it doesn't specifically cover ARINC-767 (used by the B787 EAFR) the history and associated detail is interesting and may give a little useful background:

  In terms of actual data recovery I had a look around but couldn't find any video that showed this from an EAFR, however this NTSB YT link gives insight into how data was recovered from an earlier FDR unit (mounted in a
  <span style="color:#131313">
   Bombardier CRJ700
  </span>
  ). While it's different to that installed in the 787 the nature of the work and how it's carefully carried out may give some insight.

     I suspect both recorders will contain the same data. Given the radio transmission after the loss of thrust the aircraft still had at least the emergency electrical bus powered. This should have kept both recorders online. It is however possible given the 10 minute battery backup that Boeing chose to put the the recorders on another bus but that\x92s not the norm.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I didn\x92t really find a clear reference for other posts (trying to avoid the hamster wheel to over-rev)  but in general the emergency busses only support equipment needed for survival.
  <br/>
  CVR and FDR, och combined such is not needed for survival.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I would state that in general the CVR/FDR is shedded when on emergency electricity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its clear from earlier posts that the front EAFR have a battery backup for this reason and the aft has not.

     I am not certain on that. Remember the 737 didn't have them on the standby bus (Jeju). The NTSB doc states they're powered from the L/R 28VDC buses on the 787.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     This shows the centre TRUs can only power the instrument buses not the L/R DC buses, the RAT can't really power the right TRU without powering both R1/R2 buses, and powering the left TRU would require powering the left 235/115 ATU which would probably be a lot of magnetising current even if not much actual load. The contactor naming supports that.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     My money is on the L/R DC buses being unpowered in RAT operation; only the CA/FO instrument buses and the 235VAC backup bus.
    </div>
   </div>

  That's exactly why I would really recommend reading through the NTSB FDR report on the 2013 JA829J Boston incident helpfully posted by

  . There's potentially a wealth of data concerning a to me at least surprisingly number of 2000 of parameters written on a 787 EAFR, that is that at least if there's elec power. Even the 10 min RIPS is useless if there's no data sent from electrically shut off systems.

     The requirements I have seen indicate that RIPS is applicable only to CVR or the CVR function of an EAFD. If you are aware of any requirement for RIPS to support flight data recording would you please provide a reference.

   </div>

  I believe the GE EAFR continues to function as both FDR and CVR for a minimum of 10 minutes following a power failure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However you are correct in that the requirements only specify that the CVR functions and the CAM must continue to operate.

     I believe the GE EAFR continues to function as both FDR and CVR for a minimum of 10 minutes following a power failure.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I was looking for connector pin data but only found this:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The front panel contains one connector, J1, and a grounding stud. &bull; J1 provides the main EAFR power supply, Aircraft Data Network, Ethernet Channels A and B, analog audio input, input and output discretes, and other miscellaneous signals."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If RIPS is external and the GE EAFD only has a "main power supply" pin then I agree it seems likely that the flight data function is powered by RIPS.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For RIPS to power only the CVR function I would have expected to see separate main power and RIPS power input pins. I could not find any data except the two page marketing brochure which is not definitive.

     The requirements I have seen indicate that RIPS is applicable only to CVR or the CVR function of an EAFD. If you are aware of any requirement for RIPS to support flight data recording would you please provide a reference.

  By the time you're down to EMER GEN you usually know what the problem is and most systems with parameters that could be recorded on the FDR are unpowered so what's the point of trying. The CVR with a RIPS at least helps us to try understand how or why the events to regain control after that failed.

     Nobody here could answer that, but since the authorities in India have said the recorders themselves are there and not going anywhere, I would guess that
     <i>
      if
     </i>
     any data has been downloaded and shared outside the country, it will be for specific analysis purposes - GE for example.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     There's no credible reasons 'three former accident investigators' in the US would have any direct knowledge, and if any third party in the US has been provided access to data, it will have been on the basis that it is not shared. Even that I would doubt, since involved parties are far more likely to already be in India as part of the investigation.

  One thing they said is that the accident site was 'cleaned up, short order', suggesting that this might make it difficult to check physical state against what the FDR has recorded, eg if the FDR says the flaps are down, but the physical evidence says the flaps are not down. They show video of a digger scooping up wreckage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As I said, I've been out of the loop for a few days. Do we know if the wreckage is being reconstructed in a warehouse, or whatever? I appreciate there may not have been that much left to reassemble, but the was at least one wing, a tail section, and the wing box section that the chap managed to escape from.

  There's two points here: Firstly, whether anyone outside the investigation has any credible data they are able to disclose, and secondly, whether anyone outside the investigation can report with any knowledge, what the plans are for furthering the investigation. The answer to both is no. This will also go to the question previously posed as to whether politicians are likely to have been briefed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One has to wonder why people might suggest otherwise, but the (probable) reality is that the authorities in India are doing what they think is needed in a situation where they know more than we do. If, for example, they are clearing the accident site after two weeks, they may think they have retrieved all the information from it that they can, and nobody else can really say otherwise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As to reconstructing the wreckage, who knows (as yet), though my experience of a fire on board a fully fueled aircraft that has crashed on takeoff is that there may not be much to reconstruct. Certain parts, such as wings and the tail section for example, if in coherent condition, could be recovered and removed - and I seriously doubt anyone other than on the scene at the time, would be able to know.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All in all, the supposition that this is being done 'in haste' is nonsense. It suggests there's an attempt at a cover up of some kind, which is rather silly in a situation where an airliner crashes in a very public place, thousands witness it, it's filmed and put on TV, there are investigators from local authorities, the US and UK all present - all with different and contentious interests, plus the glare of media and others is on them. But 3 guys in the US on YouTube have uncovered the truth... Yeah, I doubt it.

  Searching the web, I found out that regulations concerning new FDR require parameter 35g "fuel cut-off lever position" to be recorded. I also found that for a 2003 event with a 757, this was recorded (as was fuel flow).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I expect that this is also true for the 787. Can anyone confirm this?
