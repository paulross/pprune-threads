     Seriously??

     Come on! The gear never moved! You're an Airbus pilot; do you really think that could happen? If so, would the captain then sit there fat, dumb and happy wondering what was now going on... for 10 seconds? Even I would say "Sh1t" and whip those fuel switches back on quicker than the FO could say "WTF!".

  Firstly, 10 seconds is a more than reasonable time for startle factor to impair cognition (as discussed repeatedly). Secondly, why do so many people assume it was the FO that moved the cutoff switches? He was PF, I find it more likely that the PM moved the switches (for whatever reason).

     the RAT can be deployed manually, and I believe a pilot did that here before power was lost.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I don't think this answers my question? Evidently there is an interruption in power, the (quite stable, at that point) ADS-B stream cuts out and doesn't return for the final twenty seconds of flight. And there are other indications that non-essential loads were shed, like the survivor remembering what must have been emergency exit lighting in the cabin. Though I would have liked explicit confirmation of AC power loss happening or not in the report.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The timing of data loss seemingly lining up with the first cutoff switch being flipped back to RUN seems a little too coincidental to me, but again hopefully someone with relevant knowledge has a mundane explanation for this.

     10 seconds to respond is a long long time if you\x92ve just made a silly mistake, you\x92d have those switches back on in a second. The startle factor isn\x92t really a factor here, because you
     <b>
      know
     </b>
     what just happened.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Regardless of what actually happened in that cockpit, reasoning like this seems completely backwards to me. Since when do humans reliably, instantly recognise that they've just made a mistake? If they were
  <i>
   that
  </i>
  attuned to their actions they're almost certainly attuned enough to
  <i>
   not
  </i>
  make the mistake in the first place, especially if we're talking about an action slip. I've e.g. absentmindedly added salt to my tea instead of sugar and I certainly didn't immediately realise that I'd done that - in fact it took a good few seconds even after sipping and spitting it out for my brain to catch up to what must have happened. Even if an observer had pointed out to me before drinking it that my tea had salt in it, I would just have been confused because
  <i>
   obviously
  </i>
  I wouldn't do something that silly (spoiler alert: I did).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On top of that I feel like people are overestimating how long ten seconds actually is, especially considering some of those seconds are reported to have been taken up by confused dialogue (that isn't even reported in its entirety). I thought it was common wisdom that accidents are never down to one thing; it would be light-years from being the first time that suboptimal crew response turned a maybe-recoverable error into a definite disaster without an ounce of malice in the mix.

     It suggests to me that the RAT deployment was initiated while the engines were still above idle and generating electrical power. Obviously one of the pilots could have done it via depressing the switch, as it's a "dual engine failure/stall" memory item (see

     Is there a way for the RAT to deploy while the engines are still above idle?

  Loss of hydraulics or electrics will auto deploy the rat. The timing to me however seems to match up with when the engines were selected off.

  If the thrust levers were found in idle but, according to the EAFR, were set to TO thrust until the end, doesn\x92t that also raise further questions? I mean: Of course, the impact causes compression at the nose, but the centrifugal forces act in the opposite direction. So, if there is an objective inconsistency here, and we have a pilot who says he did not operate the fuel cut-off switches, while the EAFR indicates otherwise, then we have yet another inconsistency.

     On top of that I feel like people are overestimating how long ten seconds actually is, especially considering some of those seconds are reported to have been taken up by confused dialogue (that isn't even reported in its entirety). I thought it was common wisdom that accidents are never down to one thing; it would be light-years from being the first time that suboptimal crew response turned a maybe-recoverable error into a definite disaster without an ounce of malice in the mix.

  After making a mistake like accidentally turning off the engines, most pilot's brains would
  <b>
   immediately
  </b>
  realize what they\x92d done, and their hand being right there, they\x92d
  <b>
   immediately
  </b>
  reset both fuel switches to run. If you were slow, it would take 2 seconds, not 10.
  <br/>
  Again, the situation isn\x92t a surprise to you, you
  <b>
   know
  </b>
  what just happened.
