     Deliberate pilot action should be ruled out until any evidence and motivation for why that's the case emerges.

      <br>
       All we know is the fuel cut off switches were flipped to Cutoff for 10 seconds and then to run again. Not how or by what. The focus should be on how this could occur. Accidentally, technical malfunction, a foreign object somehow hitting and moving them or other reason?

         Theories needs to be tested in a cockpit with the exact configuration of this aircraft and with the angles and forces involved as much as we can. It should be possible to simulate it pretty closely and whatever happened should be repeatable. It's going to be something extremely unlikely, or we'd have seen it before in 10 years of 787 service.

  The one pilot asked the other one, \x93why did you cutoff?\x94
  <br>
   He didn\x92t say, \x93did you just see that pink elephant fall off the dashboard?\x94
   <br>
    <br>
     How are you going to \x93simulate something pretty closely\x94 when it\x92s also \x93extremely unlikely\x94?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The chance that it was a mechanical or electrical failure of
     <b>
      both
     </b>
     fuel switches ,
     <b>
      2 seconds apart
     </b>
     , is for all intents and purposes, zero.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Therefore they were moved by hand.

  From a PPRuNe perspective, good discussion here is desirable, as it is from a pilot perspective too. Nonsense or needlessly accusatory discussion, though it is discussion here, is not so good for pilots, and other well informed readers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some members want this thread locked, which is a choice we moderators can make, other members want discussion, which, if good, is desirable for everyone. We moderators prefer to not lock threads, we like to moderate, not terminate!
  <br/>
  <br/>
  So, could we all agree that knowing that both condition switches were selected  to cutoff by a pilot, we do not have information as to which pilot? What interest are we serving anyone by speculating which pilot here and now? Perhaps later, a full report adds to this knowledge, but possibly never.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I see four groups of readers here: Pilots of two crew airplanes, who are now instinctively more alert to what they are doing, and what their co crew is doing; Single crew pilots, who know that they are their own guardian against mistakes anyway; Designers, who are now thinking about improving designs to minimize the effects of pilot error; And, politely, everyone else.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pilots of two crew airplanes, you know what you have to do. Is slighting two members of our community helpful right now? In my opinion, I don't see how...
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Single pilots, you're on your own. Designers, yeah, we're thinking....
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Everyone else, the professional pilots forum is accepting your participation, please be respectful with what you post - you're posting it about pilots who recently passed away with high trauma. Is what you're about to post something helpful? Do you really want to say it? Will the pilot group be better because you did?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  We moderators don't want to lock the thread. And, we don't want to allow our core group of professional pilots to become profoundly aggravated by pages of low value posts. Please make our moderator jobs easier for us!
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thanks, Pilot DAR

     Just a thought &mdash; the fire extinguisher handles perform the same function as the fuel cut-off. Could there have been a strap, booklet or something else that accidentally got under the handles and activated them when one of the pilots removed the item?

     10 and 14 seconds to switch them back on is not what I would call \x91an immediate positive intervention\x92\x92!
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Maybe it took the pilot 9 seconds to determine the switched were in cutoff.
