  I'd agree, without expert knowledge there would have to be big assumptions, but I expect that Aircraft Flight Engineers could do it. Probably already have.

    The ADS-B datagrams sent by the aircraft show a much diminished climb rate with decaying speed, betraying insufficient thrust in that phase of the flight. That somewhat contradicts your assertions.

  Sure, actual data is usually more accurate than eyeballed stuff. But not always. In fact, it's often the eye that determines that something measured or calculated is "Off". How accurate is ADS-B data? I've seen FR24 tracks go way off course then suddenly get corrected / interpolated, frequently. The erroneous data seems to be "removed" by their algorithm, but where are the errors arising? Why this inaccuracy, and therefore, how accurate are the datagrams referred to? I know there were no datagrams received during the backtrack that I accept actually occurred, but that's completely different from receiving erroneous ADS-B data.

    I also do not have faith in anyone's ability to watch the cctv video and confidently determine through mere eyeballing that the climb rate did not decay by 15% within the first 100 feet or so.

  Sure, the CCTV footage I've seen is very poor, a video, moved about and zoomed, of the CCTV screen. Not easy to judge, but still useful and could be analysed frame-by-frame to compensate for all the extraneous input. Anyway, it's obvious to me that the rate of climb dropped abruptly just before the flight attained its apex, as if thrust was suddenly cut off. Knowing the momentum to altitude conversion, it might be possible to estimate whether that's true or not. The evident RAT deployment supports engine shutdown, not just engines to Idle, doesn't it? In that case, it would be useful to know at what altitude the engine shutdown took place.

  Just curious to get an idea of how much in this case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To be honest, i believe that taking a lot of the evidence into consideration, it is possible to arrive at a limited number of scenarios for what is most likely to have happened.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One fact that alters things substantially is whether the survivor's impression is correct that possibly the engines started to spool up again just before impact. If that's the case then what does that do to the possibility or otherwise that the TMCA system caused a dual engine shutdown?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To me, since the world seems to be watching this forum, and we are getting no feedback from the authorities, what is posted here might be useful in helping the investigators look at things they might not have considered. Besides, as Icarus2001 has kindof suggested, it's probably a very good thing that there are clearly lots of keen eyes on this.

  I perfectly understand that there is much talking about TCMA here.
  <br/>
  There is no direct evidence of what caused the crash but several indirect evidences point towards a near simultaneous shutdown of both engines without any visual clue of a catastrophic mechanical mishap. This leads to suspecting near simultaneous fuel starvation of both engines.
  <br/>
  As the purpose of TCMA is shutting down the High Pressure Shut-Off Valve (HPSOV) and thus the fuel feed of an engine, it's normal to collect information on TCMA, on how it works, and on what data feeds it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, I hardly understand why there is no similar discussion about the spar valves and the systems that control their opening and closure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I understand that the B787 spar valves are located in the MLG well, or at least are maintained from within that well.
  <br/>
  If the engine shutdown happened when the gear retraction was commanded, that's a location commonality (although it's very unlikely that a mechanical problem happened in both wells at the same time).
  <br/>
  Also I understand that there are several systems that command the opening or closing of the spar valves:
  <br/>
  - opening: "Engine control panel switch" set to "START", or "Fuel control switch" set to "RUN"
  <br/>
  - closing: "Engine fire handle" pulled out. (I wonder if "Fuel control switch" set to "CUTOFF" also closes the spar valve).
  <br/>
  Are there direct wires running from these controls to the valves or is there a pair of control units receiving these signals and controlling the valve actuators?
  <br/>
  If the latter is true, where are these control units? I guess that the likely location is the aft EE bay. Are they beside each other?

  Right. ADS-B is transmitted via radio, so reception can be patchy, or obstructed by someone else transmitting on the same frequency (e.g. other aircraft), so not every datagram that the aircraft sends gets received. When that happens, the live display of FR24 assumes the aircraft kept doing what it did, and when another datagram eventually comes in, it corrects the position. It also connects the locations of these datagrams, regardless of whether the aircraft actually went there. For example, in the AI171 there's a 4-minute gap between a datagram sent on the taxiway, and the next datagram sent when the aircraft was off the ground towards the departure end of the taxiway. FR24 then connected these points via the shortest route; but we know that the aircraft actually used the intervening 4 minutes to taxi to the approach end of the runway, where it then started its take-off run. So that was false. (Another source of errors is when different FR24 receivers don't have synchronised clocks, so a mixture of data from these can have weird artifacts as a result.)
  <br/>
  However, the datagrams that FR24 actually received were correct. They contain the GPS position of AI171 and its unadjusted barometric altitude, as determined by its onboard instruments. This data is as reliable as the instruments themselves are. (An example here is that the NTSB wasn't sure that the altimeter on the Blackhawk that crashed at Washington-Reagan was accurate; if that is the case, the ADS-B data would also be affected.)
  <br/>

  , FR24 have published the data that they actually received.

    Okay, didn't know that, I guess suggests means it's uncertain? Can you tell me from what height to what height it suggests this?
   </div>
  </div>
  It's uncertain because the 787 rounds all altitudes it sends to the nearest multiple of 25. The altitudes sent were from 575 ft to 625 ft., but that's MSL and not adjusted for the weather: low air pressure makes that number higher than the actual altitude. FR24 adjusted this to 21ft climbing to 71 ft, but it could've been 30 to 60 or maybe 10 to 80, as it's rounded. I think it's fairly close to 50 feet of climb, though.

  1) people taking the MSL altitude literally (625 ft)
  <br/>
  2) people adjusting for airport elevation (189 ft), but not for pressure: 437 ft
  <br/>
  3) people adjusting for pressure, some adjusting for temperature, get 71 to ~100 feet for the last recorded altitude.
  <br/>
  But while ADS-B reception was lost then (or the transmitter lost power), the aircraft continued climbing; examine the cctv video, knowing the wingspan is ~200 feet, we see that the aircraft reached 200 feet but not much more.

  The survivor likened the sound to a car engine revving up. If you've listened to a good version of the phone video, you'll have noticed the "vroom" sound at the start that some likened to a motorcycle. That sound is the RAT in action, and you can imagine what that would sound like when it rapidly spins up: like a driver stepping on the throttle with their car engine in neutral.

  The RAT deploying is a consequence of a dual engine shutdown. It says nothing about whether the TMCA was involved.

     With full reverse thrust you know that when de-selecting reverser from idle reverse, you have to give the engines plenty of time to slow down otherwise you would get the little "kick in the back" as during deceleration you would generate instant forward thrust when the reversers are stowed.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  The fan never stops rotating in a normal engine loss. Having been through a catastrophic engine failure in a 767 I can tell you that trust stops almost instantly. Certainly no more than 2 seconds. It also needs to be understood that thrust is not linear to engine speed in a jet. Very little thrust is generated below 70% RPM and thrust increases rapidly above 85%. The fan simple becomes a big source of drag almost immediately if the turbine section shuts down or fails.

  Yes, got it, but wasn't what I was meaning to ask, sorry. My bad. I'm about over this TMCA stuff because it sounds like it's Trade Secret so a lot of guesswork, but the question I was intending was:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If the TMCA did activate and shut off the fuel for whatever reason, what causes the TMCA/FADEC Hardware (and Software) to Reset, since it's independently powered off the engine-driven PMG after engine start? There is so much here that is just so unclear. I haven't seen anything about a Reset input anywhere, and since it's supposed to work only when on the ground, that's not really necessary, as the engine will eventually spool down. At some point before that, the PMG output voltage will go to low enough that the FADEC/TMCA
  <b>
   should
  </b>
  be forced into a Hardware Reset. That's all fine on the ground, but in the air, the engine will windmill, potentially until.... Is the PMG output fed through a switch/relay that cuts the FADEC/TMCA supply at low (i.e. windmill) RPM, so that a Pilot-activated Engine Off/On cycle can reconnect the Aircraft FADEC Supply link, thus Rebooting the FADEC so that it reopens the Fuel Shutoff valve(s)?  It all seems so "awkward". And potentially fatal.  Is this a scenario that the designers considered? (Who can answer that one?
  <img alt="" border="0" class="inlineimg" src="https://www.pprune.org/images/smilies/yeees.gif" title="Hmmm"/>
  )
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Just now, I realise that if this is roughly what happens, then maybe the engines did commence a restart just before impact, due to the plane being deliberately mushed/stalled to the ground as softly as possible, thereby reducing the windmill RPM. And maybe the engines restarting interfered with that planned landing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Or maybe I've got this all wrong. I'm hoping someone will tell us all.

     During a flameout it takes a while before the fan has slowed down sufficiently. As long as it rotates, thrust is generated.

  This got me thinking, looking at the engine mounted shutoff valve (HPSOV) in ATA 76, I see that its operated by three sources
  <ul>
   <li>
    FADEC, as discussed in a number of posts above
   </li>
   <li>
    RUN / CUTOFF switch
   </li>
   <li>
    engine fire control panel
   </li>
  </ul>
  I have a hard time believing the pilots would have touched the engine fire controls under such conditions (obviously they are highly trained for engine failure before Vr), but am I correct when I say that the behavior of the plane systems closely resembles what would happen if the engine fire signal was triggered?
  <ul>
   <li>
    engine fuel spar and high-pressure valves would be cutoff (obviously)
   </li>
   <li>
    hydraulics pump would be depressurized and shutoff from the circuit
   </li>
   <li>
    electrical generators would be disconnected
   </li>
  </ul>
  We wouldn't be talking about this flight had this occured on a single engine, so I believe this should had happened on both at about the same time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Looking at ATA26 the engine fire control panel is energized by the hot battery bus (HOT BB). Is it credible that a
  <b>
   failure of the hot battery bus
  </b>
  (for example due to damage or liquid ingress in the
  <b>
   P300 panel
  </b>
  ) could lead to this situation?

    One fact that alters things substantially is whether the survivor's impression is correct that possibly the engines started to spool up again just before impact. If that's the case then what does that do to the possibility or otherwise that the TMCA system caused a dual engine shutdown?
   </div>
  </div>
  That&rsquo;s what got me headed down the low altitude capture route. While the mind does really strange things post traumatic event &mdash; and memory and recollection are greatly affected by it &mdash; if true it means that thrust was lost but the engines stayed lit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There may have been other electrical and systems malfunctioning. But if whatever happened, let&rsquo;s say the auto throttle simply pulled power to idle &mdash;or a low power setting&mdash;at a critical time. Perhaps on its own perhaps with other systems failures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  We like to think it basic that we&rsquo;d slam the throttles forward. Right away.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Asiana didn&rsquo;t.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And neither did Air Florida years ago.

  Sorry if this has been covered in the previous 1 million posts, but do we know if the training captain or trainee was handling the takeoff? The one thing that does change at V1 is PF\x92s hand comes off the thrust levers and joins the other hand on the control column. How long until people then put their hand back on the thrust levers varies a lot. Especially if turbulent or there is a perception of difficult handling ie) engine failure which often delays it. If your hand is on the thrust lever then should be able to feel them moving - unless gripping them so firmly it over rides the clutches.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Oh, and the FDRs haven\x92t been read yet as they were damaged in the fire.

     Shutting down the wrong engine below 400 AGL is extremely rare. So rare in fact that I believe it has not happened in a jet transport class aircraft.

  It happened to a BAC 111 taking off from Linate Milan in 1969 when the wrong engine was shut down after a surge on takeoff. The plane never got above 250 feet and landed in a snow covered field gear up. The wrong engine identification was initiated by a Captain on the jumpseat!

     Strange, as I would have estimated this quite differently based on layman's intuition. If one assumes average values, then the approximate flight profile of AI171 according to layman's guidance certainly fits a situation in which the engines failed at or even very shortly before rotation.
    </span>
   </div>

  IMO, if those engines failed just after rotation, there is no way that jet would have got anywhere near 200ft, especially if the fuel was "cut off", as opposed to back to Idle.

  At 420k lbs (310k lb ZFW+110k lb Fuel), the (takeoff) V2 Flap 5 is 157kts. The (landing) Vref for Flap 5 I estimate to be at least 160kts (the FCOM I have has no figures for Flap 5 landings; F20 Vref is 154; the manoeuvre speed for Flap 5 is 189). Typically, you'd probably be at V2+15 when you get established in the climb after rotation.

     Would these 20 to 30 knots of additional energy be sufficient to lift the aircraft to a good 200 ft during and after rotation?

  No. With a pitch attitude of around 15\xb0, that's quite a bit of weight being supported not only by the wings but by the engine thrust vector. Cut that and you stop going up very quickly. Note Sailvi's comment above.

     If the angle of attack is then successively reduced, wouldn't the airplane still have enough lift to glide for a few seconds before losing all or nearly all lift?

  ANY reduction in pitch attitude would cause the climb to cease immediately. These aircraft are going so slowly, relatively, and the drag is so high that any small change in pitch attitude will cause an increase in descent rate with very little increase in speed (or no lessening of deceleration).

     Wouldn't it be the case that if the thrust had only ceased five seconds after rotation, the aircraft would then have reached a good 250 ft with the engines still running and then another good 200 ft in normal conditions before the speed was used up to about 150 kn?
    </span>
   </div>
  </div>
  Not IMO. Basically, the only reason this jet is flying is because of the whopping long thrust vector out the back. It's already almost back at minimum speed anyway for flap 5 so there is very speed to trade. In this case, I wouldn't be trading anything, because the speed reduction rate would be too fast.

  My estimate is around 200ft (one wingspan) and I hypothesise the engines were producing plenty of thrust until about 7 seconds, before it stops climbing at around 12 seconds after liftoff.

  <b>
   @Brace

  , I think you're exaggerating the residual thrust effect at lower RPMs. Of course 70% would get you round the pattern but you're at a much lower drag config and you're going much faster, again less drag. And are improved-climb takeoffs in the 787-8 even a thing?  I can't see a two-stage rotation.

     Edit to add - I have made no attempt to correct the raw ADS-B altitude data. There is no need to make any correction to see altitude gain.

  I posted my first-cut analysis in the earlier thread.
  <br/>
  I've had a bit more time to analyse now.
  <br/>
  Those ADS-B data points (and particularly the rate of deceleration) are EXACTLY what you would expect to see from a total engine failure at or very shortly after TAKE-OFF
  <br/>
  (it implies a 13:1 L/D which must be pretty close for gear down and flaps 5).
  <br/>
  It places takeoff at 700m before the runway end @ ~185kt
  <br/>
  Based on those, max altitude was c250ft @ 140kt (or the equivalent total energy equivalent), 500m after the end of the runway.
  <br/>
  13:1 L/D would also get you groundspeed on impact of 120kt
  <br/>
  Do those numbers make sense?

     ... The generally held theory for each engine\x92s FADEC failure (due to a common software error related to a ground-air sensing failure) is not supported by the cumulative hours over many years without such a failure. So, if you then look around for another component that can shut down two engines simultaneously you end up with the fuel shut-off valves (FSOV). Why? On each engine It is fail-safed to close off fuel-feed flows by a spring that is held
     <b>
      <i>
       <u>
        open
       </u>
      </i>
     </b>
     by a solenoid. If that solenoid loses electrical power, the FSOV closes and the engine shuts down after a short period.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Are you certain of that? Because tdracer (and perhaps others) have asserted that the valves are latching, and must be powered on OR off, precisely so that an electrical power loss does not close the valve (and shut down the engine).

     The fan never stops rotating in a normal engine loss. Having been through a catastrophic engine failure in a 767 I can tell you that trust stops almost instantly. Certainly no more than 2 seconds. It also needs to be understood that thrust is not linear to engine speed in a jet. Very little thrust is generated below 70% RPM and thrust increases rapidly above 85%.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  You are using explanations that are correct but with wrong appreciation for the values and how much thrust is available and what it is used for. Yes, the relation is not linear, far from, but the thrust required at low altitudes is for the initial climbout and acceleration, aka against gravity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  70% is not "very little", it is almost the required thrust in level flight with intermediate flaps out and gear down at those altitudes (depending on the weight). Without the gear, 60% is enough to keep level flight. If you want to descend, 55% is enough to keep speed with flaps full landing configuration and gear down on a 3\xb0 glide. So even at 55% N1, the aircraft wouldn't stall, it would gradually descend if the pitch would be correct.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is what is between 70 and max rated that is needed for the initial climbout and that thrust is "excess" as it is there needed for the second segment in case of engine out. Considering the fact that the climb only lasted 10 seconds, 2 seconds is 20% of that time where the engines were still pushing. It is not because it is "significantly less" that it is nothing (that's why when you apply full reverse and don't let the engines slow down with idle selected, you will feel the kick forward.)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If you look at the takeoff video, you will see that the aircraft does a very rotation that some pilots prefer to avoid tailstrike: first initial rotation, constant pitch to allow the aircraft to become airborne avoiding tailstrike, second increase in pitch at which point the rate of climb quickly disappears. At that point, the "parabolic" maneuver with constant nose up is created, very typical for a loss of thrust (loss of airspeed with constant pitch).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Which begs the question why they never lowered the nose...

  GA guy who's been reading the thread from the beginning..
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I'm assuming my question is moot because I don't believe it's been mentioned in the entire thread, however is there any possible maintenance issue that could affect two engines over time?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is certainly happened before,  I'm thinking of
  <span style="color:#1f1f1f">
   N334EA where all three engines were lost due to maintenance replacing all three chip detectors with defective detectors before the flight.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Of course it took 40 something minutes before the first engine oil was drained and the other two engines failed at different times after that.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   So that pattern doesn't fit, but my question is are there other things that could be replaced on both engines that could theoretically take a relatively long time to fail but might do so under TOGA?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In other words are there any devices that could have been changed on both engines before the previous flight that were defective and didn't fail until full power on both engines on take off on the accident flight?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Obviously this is pure speculation, I don't claim to know anything and I'm just curious.

    he autopilot would NOT be engaged below 400&rsquo; (or 200&rsquo; in the 78&ndash;although I doubt anyone engages it that low. The autopilot and autothrottles are separate systems but do interact. The autothrottles typically WOULD be engaged from the start of the takeoff roll; using the TOGA levers to set takeoff thrust).
   </div>
  </div>
  Both the B777 and B787 have a minimum autopilot engage height of 200'. I would suggest it is often the best course of action after an engine failure to engage the autopilot at 200' to dramatically reduce the workload!

    I am guessing because although I flew the 777 I never tried a low altitude capture before VNAV engaged &mdash; and it`s been a few years). But think it probably would. As one goes through 50&rsquo; LNAV engages; VNAV is normally armed prior to the EFIS check if it`s to be used (which it usually is). So in this scenario LNAV would have been engaged but since VNAV is armed but never engages my guess is that the automatics would engage in SPD/LVAV/ALT.
   </div>
  </div>
  When talking about low altitude capture below the 400' VNAV engagement height, although it has been talked about, would mean (mis) setting the MCP altitude to less than 400'. I really find that implausible. You are correct though that the modes would be SPD | LNAV | ALT should this occur.

    HOLD is present in many other regimes of flight; all it means is that the auththrottle (right now) is not controlling the throttles and they stay where they are&mdash;and the PF can move them if desired at will. Fr` instance, when descending in FLCH or even VNAV SPD the throttles will usually be in HOLD. (To me this usually meant `hold` the throttles&mdash;and tweek them in descent as required). Thrust can be modulated to adjust rate of descent (the throttles become vertical speed levers). On altitude capture in the case of FLCH or path capture in the case of VNAV SPD (in descent) the auththrottles kick in and it becomes SPD/xxx/ALT (or VPTH or VALT as the case might be).

  All correct.

    Most everyone knew the autothrottles would not engage below 400` and that FLCH in descent at very low altitudes was not an appropriate mode &mdash; and they did not activate providing low speed protection in the case of Asiana.
   </div>
  </div>
  The lack of autothrottle automatic activation when the autothrottles are in HOLD mode and the speed has decayed below minimum manouevring speed has been addressed. The autothrottle will now automatically activate if, when in HOLD mode, the speed decays below minimum manouevring speed with FMC software after BP4 on the B787 and after AIMS V17B on the B777.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since the Asiana accident many airlines prohibit use of FLCH below 1,000' and the lowest altitude setting when using FLCH is then, of course, 1.000'

    IIRC our throttles went into HOLD at 60 knots and stayed there until VNAV activated (THR REF&mdash;takeoff thrust). It was also possible that the autothrottles under some environmentals wouldn`t fully achieve takeoff thrust setting (EPR or N1 depending on which engines) and they could be manually moved in HOLD to achieve it. Although I don`t remember that as ever happening.
   </div>
  </div>
  Almost fully correct, the speed when autothrottles transition to HOLD on takeoff is 80kts. on both the B777 and B787.

     Hello, this is my first post on pprune; as a 787 pilot I\x92m also puzzled by this accident. All seem to agree that for some reason there was a complete electrical failure and RAT deployment. With a complete electrical failure all six main fuel pumps fail. Each engine also has two mechanically driven fuel pumps. On takeoff, if there is fuel in the center tank, it will be used first, pumped by the two center tank pumps.
     <br/>
     My airline\x92s manuals don\x92t go into much detail, but I read on another site that if both the center tank pumps fail, the engine driven pumps aren\x92t able to suction feed well enough from the center tanks to sustain engine operation. If there was fuel in the center tanks, a complete electrical failure would soon lead to center tank fuel pumps failure (all fuel pumps failure as stated previously) and fuel starvation of both engines. A rescue from this situation would be an immediate selection of both center tank fuel pumps OFF (not if my airline\x92s non-normal checklists) and waiting for successful suction feed from the L and R main tanks to occur, this would take a number of seconds.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Great first post (IMMHO!) If this is correct, then I think you are onto something very significant. No expert, just an outside the box thinker who has been trying to see what ordinary (non-pilot-blaming) explanations there could be for a near simultaneous dual engine failure. I imagine a complete electrical failure leading to fuel starvation from lack of pump feed pressure from the centre tank would not result in apparently near simultaneous engine failure, but who knows? (Aren't there (suction) bypass valves here, but maybe they get stuck after long non-opening - instead long subject to closing pressures?)  This could have been the case here as my experience suggests the probabilities aren't small.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  FWIW, according to earlier posts, the fuel load was about 50T, leaving about 18T in the centre tank, so (I think) about 25-30% full. A full centre tank might allow engine pump suction to work fine, but this might not? (Contrary to what some have said.)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anyway, FWIW, not everyone agrees with RAT Deployment - see recent post by shep69. Would love to know why he doesn't go with RAT deployment...
