  <br/>
  Let's take the sketchy CVR extract
  <i>
   as a given
  </i>
  for the moment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  So there's this hard working FO doing the takeoff. He wants to do a good job and impress favorably the Training Captain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For (reasons that I cannot fathom) the training captain On Takeoff On A Revenue Flight chops the fuel before they get to 400 feet AGL.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yes, that makes no freaking sense. None. Zero. Zip. Nada.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The natural response from PF to the PM (who is the training captain) is some version of "WTF with the fuel switches?"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And the response is "Uh, no, I didn't do that."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Think about this for a moment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  How many "WTF?" things erupt in your brain
  <i>
   if that was the sequence of events?
  </i>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Full Disclosure: I was in charge of the CRM training for the Navy (all of it) for a couple of years (and yes, that was a couple of decades ago). We got our CRM stuff, mostly, From The Commercial Airline Industry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But, honestly, that reported back and forth between PF and PM has me smacking my forehead in disbelief... given the advanced state of CRM training in today's airline industry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I confess to you all: I am more confused by this report than I was by the first two days of "data" eruption after the crash.

  This is pure speculation but I can envision the following sequence of events that would match the timeline and the little we know from the CVR and sequence of events.
  <br/>
  - While PF is concentrated on flying the airplane, PNF moves the switches from RUN to CUTOFF in quick succession (for whatever reason).
  <br/>
  - PF doesn't notice that the switches have been moved (again, he is concentrated on flying) but soon perceives the loss of thrust and sees a message on EICAS.
  <br/>
  - PF looks down to check throttle position. It takes him a couple seconds to realize that the switches are in CUTOFF position.
  <br/>
  - PF asks PNF (and his superior) "Why did you cut off the engines?" (or something similar). PNF anwers that he didn't (a lie, but we don't know if deliberate or just confusion / mental breakdown)
  <br/>
  - PF realizes that PNF is in a wrong mental state, and attempts to restart the engines. It takes him a couple of seconds to move both switches because his other hand is on the yoke trying to stabilize the airplane.
  <br/>
  - By then the airplane has lost too much energy for a successful recovery. One of the pilots calls MAYDAY because he knows that they are about to crash.
  <br/>
  This sequence would match the timeline between the initial fuel cutoff, and when the switches were moved back to run position, and would actually indicate great presence of mind and quick decision from the PF.
  <br/>
  Again, this is pure speculation but it would match well with the little information we have.

     If there was some kind of Stabiliser error message during the timeline of this accident it would certainly be mentioned in the preliminary report. I am sure that the investigators would have noted it and arrived to similar conclusion you did. A Stabiliser error message would be too relevant piece of information to ignore it in the report.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Thanks for your comment. Agreed, but why did the report make mention of the Stabiliser fault on the previous sector? If this is completely irrelevant, why was it mentioned at all? There a quite a few specifics that are missing from this initial report, such as specific CVR information (what was actually said by the pilots). The report also says "...The EAFR data downloaded from forward EAFR is being analyzed in detail..." This indicates that more is known than is in the report. I suspect that the initial report was put out to meet the "30 day rule" and there will be further interim reports before the final.

     My only question is, after close to 40 years flying, on takeoff, if I lost thrust/ Power, my immediate reaction would NOT BE TO CHECK THE FUEL CONTROL SWITCHES. Unless the Pilot flying saw the Pilot monitoring visually reach down and shut the fuel control switches off, which would be odd since as the PF, your attention is looking at the instruments and outside, not inside and downward in the direction of the FC switches. It seems odd how quickly they ascertained the fuel control switches were shut off. No startle factor, or confusion, just a very quick determination that the FC switches were cutoff. Very strange.

   </div>
  </div>
  yes this is the part that has been bugging me also the more I\x92ve thought about it
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It\x92s a little annoying that we don\x92t know who spoke the and who denied about the cutoffs but it\x92s kind of the secondary issue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 787 has HUDs, PF is looking straight ahead and \x91up\x92 (as the U in HUD suggests), the cutoff toggles are not at all in his field of view , quite similar for the PM
  <br/>
  <br/>
  the CVR transcript will have to reveal a lot more because the current sequence of events doesn\x92t really answer that much other than to rule out a few other theories

  It's established fact both fuel control switches moved to CUTOFF 4 seconds after Vr, a deliberate guarded action, not easily done accidentally.
  <br/>
  The CVR records one pilot asking &ldquo;Why did you cut off?&rdquo;, the other replies &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t&rdquo;. Then a bland Mayday attributed to the Captain &ldquo;engine failure, returning&rdquo; in the middle of the crisis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The language, if reported correctly, feels strangely detached. No confusion, no urgency, no clear troubleshooting. Not drawing conclusions, but does anyone else see signs of performative behaviour, that is saying the right things outwardly, while being at odds with the underlying cause?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I appreciate that both crew members lost their lives, however if we avoid discussing uncomfortable patterns, we miss the point of investigation and learning.

  &ZeroWidthSpace;&ZeroWidthSpace;&ZeroWidthSpace;You might be technically correct here but this line of thinking doesn't fit with the rest of the events. If they weren't physically and observably set to CUTOFF, setting aside the spoken comment, then how were they subsequently reverted to RUN? You would be saying that some invisible systems fault produced a temporary 10 second condition, starting to apply to both switches 1 second apart and ceasing to apply 4 seconds apart. Even within a very low probability scenario, it doesn't seem plausible - this was all physical, for reasons unknown.

     08:09:11 EAFR recording stops

     <br/>
     Fuel cutoff switches operated within 1 second of each other suggests to me that the locking mechanism wasn't working as per (SAIB) No. NM-18-33. Any loose item could have accidentally (or not) operated the switches (including hands).

  Really? It suggests to me and I would imagine the vast majority of us who have flown modern Boeings that they were physically moved, by one of the crew, one at a time, the question is why.

  From the report it is clear that the switches were selected to cut off, we will likely NEVER know why, maybe the CVR gives a few more clues but we will never know if it was an intentional or accidental act. What is clear is that during rotation you are never fiddling with bags etc.

  Why do investigative bodies insist on publishing "transcripts" of recordings - CVR, ATC, Centre etc - rather than the actual recording?   I've seen "transcripts" that, on any interpretation whatsoever that is open to anyone reading it, disclose errors by at least one person, which errors don't feature in the report.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Simple example of a "transcript" of CVR audio from a Centre transmission in an actual investigation report:  "Visibility 999".    What does that "transcript" tell us about what was actually said by Centre?   Was it: "nine hundred and ninety nine"?  Was it:  "nine nine nine"?   Was it:  "niner niner niner"?   If
  <b>
   any
  </b>
  of those alternatives were true, it would surely follow that an error was made on the part of Centre.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Or maybe there's an error in the purported transcription of the recording.   Maybe Centre said: "niner niner niner niner".  Or maybe Centre said: "in excess of 10 kilometres".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Solving the mystery of this tragedy depends on what was actually said in the cockpit - the actual words used - by whom - precisely - and exactly when.   Yet we still don't even have a published recording of the radio calls between the aircraft and ATC.

  I still think it should be possible to identify the voices from the CVR. During taxi out with P2 as pilot flying the exchanges between them should be obvious as to who is speaking. Thus the identity of the pilot asking about cut off would become clear.

     As someone suggested, the person asking the question might have asked it to cover the fact that he had performed the action.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  That will be easily answered when investigators play CVR recordings to colleagues, family and friends who can recognise and identify the voices.
  <br>
   <br>
    They probably know that answer but it is omitted from preliminary report.

     It's established fact both fuel control switches moved to CUTOFF 4 seconds after Vr, a deliberate guarded action, not easily done accidentally.
     <br/>
     The CVR records one pilot asking \x93Why did you cut off?\x94, the other replies \x93I didn\x92t\x94. Then a bland Mayday attributed to the Captain \x93engine failure, returning\x94 in the middle of the crisis.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The language, if reported correctly, feels strangely detached. No confusion, no urgency, no clear troubleshooting. Not drawing conclusions, but does anyone else see signs of performative behaviour, that is saying the right things outwardly, while being at odds with the underlying cause?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I appreciate that both crew members lost their lives, however if we avoid discussing uncomfortable patterns, we miss the point of investigation and learning.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  in that fraught moment of engines not functioning very close to the ground, the last thing to do at this critical moment when you don\x92t really known what has happened is communicate a MayDay. With the buildings looming up fast, the action required is to attempt to restart, as seems to have been done by a pilot putting the fuel switch to \x93run\x94, but too late to rescue aircraft. I think the timing of the MayDay call is strange given that the scenario called for Aviate, Navigate\x85 then Communicate.

      This is a discussion forum, of course there is (and should be!) significant discussion about a bizarre crash of a modern widebody aircraft. There will naturally be speculation and some nonsense but this is a discussion forum and that is to be expected.
