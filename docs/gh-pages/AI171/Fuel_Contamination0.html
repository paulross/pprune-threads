     A few have suggested double engine failure due to contaminated fuel, but we've seen historically that the equal likely (or perhaps more likely) reason for a double engine "failure" is accidental shutdown of the wrong engine.

  True. We won\x92t know until the CVR and Flight Data recordings have been analysed. I think these will give a clear indication of what happened. The airport has reopened so I assume there\x92s no fuel contamination risk.

     Given the sound which clearly mimics the RAT, images and collective tech knowledge, what could lead to this symmetric loss of thrust/lift at 200ft?

     Fuel supply/quality issues?

  Symmetric is the key word.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chances of both engines having simultaneous flame outs due to fuel contamination is almost not possible...too many variables to have them fail at the same time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  What we are seeing is a fairly stable flight path....in that the wings remain level throughout and a point in the flight where the vertical profile changes from a normal take off flight path into the high nose attitude descending one...albeit without any significant or abrupt maneuver.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Strange.

  That was my first thought. You don\x92t get a double engine failure for nothing else but that and maybe birds, but birds would have caused some trailing smoke or at least some visible signs on cctv at some point throughout the ingestion period.

  One example of fuel contamination causing a significant loss of thrust on both engines at low altitude.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it seems extremely unlikely for contaminated fuel to impact both engines at
  <i>
   exactly
  </i>
  the same time, with no asymmetry and no surges or smoke.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  What can cause a sudden catastrophic loss of thrust on both engines at exactly the same time?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Birds (but no apparent surges)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Inadvertent movement of the fuel cut off switches (which would be an incredible error but I suppose it could conceivably be muscle memory having done so recently after the last leg\x85weirder things have happened. Remember the 767 events of the late 80s)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Intentional shutdown of the engines (pilot suicide has happened before)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some catastrophic electrical/FADEC/engine interface failure (which I highly doubt is feasible in a modern 1309 aircraft)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I can\x92t think of any others\x85

  From the airport CCTV video it looks to me like a normal takeoff and start of climb, until suddenly there's a loss of climb performance with no obvious upset at that point. From the picture of the wing post crash it looks like the flaps were still deployed (N.B. based on pre-accident photos that's the right wing so closest to the camera is aileron and flaps are further away, damage had me confused first time), so I'm going with loss of thrust rather than flap retraction.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From the videos from bystanders it looks like RAT deployment (both sound and zoomed in pictures) rather than thrust lever retard, and that would also explain failure to retract gear - if you are dealing with both engines out at that altitude then gear isn't your first thought. From the airport CCTV video I don't see anything that looks like bird strikes at that point in the climb i.e. no obvious flocks of birds, no smoke out of the engines, no slewing one way as one engine fails and then the other is cut by accident - plus you wouldn't cut the engine at that point, you'd climb on one engine and then sort it out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Even fuel contamination or water build up in both tanks is likely to result in one engine failing a few seconds before the other. So I can't come up with anything other than both fuel cutoff switches that would result in loss of thrust and RAT deployment. Looking at a picture of the cutoff switches

   https://www.nycaviation.com/2013/08/...is-fired/30179
  </a>
  I don't see how they get hit by accident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I'm confused, hope we get an FDR / CVR readout soon.

  It&rsquo;s years since I looked at it. I thought it was in the FARs explicitly but I can only find CFR 25.1309 states the safety analysis for equipment systems and installations that would be likely encompass this.

     It\x92s years since I looked at it. I thought it was in the FARs explicitly but I can only find CFR 25.1309 states the safety analysis for equipment systems and installations that would be likely encompass this.

  The aircraft is refuelled from the same single point source.
  <br/>
  If the fuel from the bowser/ground tank was contaminated it would affect both engines.
  <br/>
  However, this would also have affected other aircraft at the airport. It could of course been refuelled with the wrong fuel, but that\x92s pretty much unheard of, and big engines like this can pretty much run on anything that will burn.

     One example of fuel contamination causing a significant loss of thrust on both engines at low altitude.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     But it seems extremely unlikely for contaminated fuel to impact both engines at
     <i>
      exactly
     </i>
     the same time, with no asymmetry and no surges or smoke.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     What can cause a sudden catastrophic loss of thrust on both engines at exactly the same time?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Birds (but no apparent surges)
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Inadvertent movement of the fuel cut off switches (which would be an incredible error but I suppose it could conceivably be muscle memory having done so recently after the last leg&hellip;weirder things have happened. Remember the 767 events of the late 80s)
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Intentional shutdown of the engines (pilot suicide has happened before)
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Some catastrophic electrical/FADEC/engine interface failure (which I highly doubt is feasible in a modern 1309 aircraft)
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I can&rsquo;t think of any others&hellip;
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  This seems to be the best summary so far. Based on the detail of the mayday its probably time to rule out the flaps, load shift, and other suggestions. Latest news is a quote from the survivor:
  <i>
   "
   <span style="color:#000000">
    Suddenly, the lights started flickering &ndash; green and white &ndash; then the plane rammed into some establishment that was there"
   </span>
  </i>
  <span style="color:#000000">
   .
  </span>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I cant think of any reason for electrical failure and "no thrust" (as per statements) without any visual cues other than (a) suicide, or (b) starvation. Is there any electrical failure that can cause fuel valves to close? I dont fly Boeing, so can any Dreamliner driver explain what conditions could trigger an overspeed and auto engine shutdown (quote from Google below)? Would short runway, and hot/low QNH do it? Also, what happened to the order demanding a full power down/recycle every 51 days?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <i>
   <span style="color:#080809">
    The EEC has build in protections to protect the engine. One of these protections is the Engine Overspeed Protection, when the core engine exceeds 120% the EEC shuts off the fuel to the applicable engine.

     One has to assume that, given the seeming lack of lateral deviation from the flight path, and with no obvious yawing or rudder input visible on the videos, there's only two realistic conclusions here? Simultaneous dual engine failure of unknown cause if the RAT was indeed deployed; or flaps reduced too early leading to a stall if the RAT wasn't deployed.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Evidence in this thread would lean me toward the RAT deployed and therefore dual engine out scenario. As for the cause of that, well, only a couple of likely scenarios exist that could cause simultaneous shutdown of both engines, including mistaken or intentional use of the fuel cutoff levers.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  I would rule out bird strike for lack of audio visual signatures of such an event and fuel contamination due to symmetry of events. Due to my trust in the profession and my distrust in modern engineering practices, my money is on Seattle.

     OK, another hour spent going through all the posts since I was on last night...
     <br/>
     I won't quote the relevant posts as they go back ~15 pages, but a few more comments:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     TAT errors affecting N1 power set: The FADEC logic (BTW, this is pretty much common on all Boeing FADEC) will use aircraft TAT if it agrees with the dedicated engine inlet temp probe -
     <i>
      but if they differ it will use the engine probe
     </i>
     . The GE inlet temp probe is relatively simple and unheated, so (unlike a heated probe) a blocked or contaminated probe will still read accurately - just with greater 'lag' to actual temperature changes.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     TCMA - first off, I have to admit that this does look rather like an improper TCMA activation, but that is very, very unlikely. For those who don't know, TCMA is a system to shutdown a runaway engine that's not responding to the thrust lever - basic logic is an engine at high power with the thrust lever at/near idle, and the engine not decelerating. However, TCMA is
     <i>
      only
     </i>
     active on the ground (unfamiliar with the 787/GEnx TCMA air/ground logic - on the 747-8 we used 5 sources of air/ground - three Radio Altimeters and two Weight on Wheels - at least
     <i>
      one of each
     </i>
     had to indicate ground to enable TCMA). TCMA will shutdown the engine via the N2 overspeed protection - nearly instantaneous. For this to be TCMA, it would require at least two major failures - improper air ground indication or logic, and improper TCMA activation logic (completely separate software paths in the FADEC). Like I said, very, very unlikely.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Fuel contamination/filter blockage: The fuel filters have a bypass - if the delta P across the filter becomes excessive, the filter bypasses and provides the contaminated fuel to the engine. Now this contaminated fuel could easy foul up the fuel metering unit causing a flameout, but to happen to two engines at virtually the same time would be tremendous unlikely.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Auto Thrust thrust lever retard - the TO lockup in the logic makes this very unlikely (it won't unlock below (IIRC) 400 ft., and even that requires a separate pilot action such as a mode select change or thrust lever movement). And if it did somehow happen, all the pilot needs to do is push the levers back up.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Engine parameters on the FDR: I don't know what exactly is on the 787 FDR with regards to engine parameters, but rest assured that there is plenty of engine data that gets recorded - most at one/second. Getting the FDR readout from a modern FDR is almost an embarrassment of riches. Assuming the data is intact, we'll soon have a very good idea of what the engines were doing
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  The speed at which there was a complete loss of thrust and electrical power degrading to the point of flickering lights and RAT deployment suggests to me an actual engine shutdown rather than anything linked to auto thrust or fuel contamination. There are not many things which can cause an engine to shut down: LP valves, FADEC incl TCMA, crew action\x85

  Something I've been wondering about this accident is the phase of the flight where the apparent power loss happened. It seems like the engines were running normally through the takeoff, until the aircraft lifted off the ground. After that the loss of power seemed to happen very quickly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Could there be a scenario where aircraft's fuel supply is interrupted by change in aircraft's attitude (for example faulty pumps, partially contaminated fuel)? Frankly I have no idea how 787's fuel pumps operate, or if fuel contamination could happen in a way that blocks the flow only when aircraft reaches certain nose-up attitude.

     Air crashes are "unlikely" a priori. Therefore I think the root cause, when determined, will be something unlikely. Best case, we learn something practical that can be mitigated in the future.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  To be clear, I am talking about the probability,
  <b>
   given this crash has happened
  </b>
  , that a particular item could be a cause.
  <br/>
  The probability of something (or maybe several somethings) being a primary cause of this crash is near unity. The question, what possible causes are likely?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To take a specific item of speculation that might case dual engine rollback, fuel contamination was suggested. I don't remember all the points made in this context, but some were: no other aircraft presumably using the same fuel supply had issues; why would both engines apparently fail near simultaneously?; why would they fail just after rotation?; and so on. The consensus seemed to be, not impossible, but unlikely (presumably in the sense I just described).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Accidental (or even deliberate) fuel shutoff was also suggested. Again, the consensus seemed to be, possible, but unlikely for this type, since previous ergonomic causes of such accidental shutoff had long since been addressed.

     Trying repeatedly to follow the whole thread plus updates but loading on the iPhone constantly jumps backwards and forwards making it a struggle to cover everything.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Two points which may or may not have relevance. One is just before the final crash, a dark-looking cover(?) flies up into the air. Could this be the first contact with sound that the surviving passenger alleges he heard?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Secondly the cost of aviation fuel seems to be comparatively more expensive in India than either Japan (leg before) or the UK (following leg). Would this effect refuelling procedures within India, supposing a company directive to save when possible?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     (Frequent long-haul passenger.)
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Good grief! They uploaded less fuel to save money??? That made the plane immediately sink to oblivion&hellip;because what? They ran out of fuel? You think airports all over India restrict fuel and endanger countless aircraft daily? It is the Captain&rsquo;s prerogative to sign off on fuel upload.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But let&rsquo;s run with it. Less fuel = lighter load. So&hellip;how does that make lift off/climb a more difficult procedure??? It shouid have been easier. How does that result in rapid loss of lift? Did they finish their tablespoon of fuel?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Or - if you are hinting at fuel contamination by being &ldquo;watered down&rdquo; somehow&hellip;why were no other aircraft affected? You might wish to consider Cathay Pacific flight 780, which suffered a serious fuel contamination incident. The problem was not initialiy detectable, but some engine underperformance was noted in one engine fairly early into the flght. The problems compounded during the flght from Surabaya to Hong Kong, culminating in complete engine shutdown. Fortunately, due to the experience and skill of Captain and Copilot, they just - only just - managed to land safely in Hong Kong. Point is - a crash scenario did not unfold in seconds.
