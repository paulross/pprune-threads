  - fuel cut offs were found in the RUN position
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - on take off roll both engines lost power as the fuel cut offs went from RUN to cutoff
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - CVR recorded one pilot asking why they had gone to CUTOFF
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - within 10 seconds the fuel cutoff was moved back to RUN
  <br/>
  <br/>
  -RAT was deployed, APU had begun auto start
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - 32 seconds after Vr the MAYDAY was called
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This should also dispel a lot of the comments about AAIB-India, Indian culture in general and general competence. For a preliminary report this is far more thorough and extensive than what would normally be expected and they\x92ve kept Boeing, GE, FAA and investigators from US, UK, Canada and Portugal in the loop from the start
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They have also clarified why it took so long to do the EAFR download- because of the extensive damage they had to source specialist equipment from the NTSB that only arrived on the 23rd of June (they downloaded on the 24th) so all that talk of a \x91coverup\x92 is pretty embarrassing now
  <br/>
  <br/>
  of course the big question is why/how those switches were commanded into cutoff in the first place  the exact sequence at Vr is the most critical, there hasn\x92t been much scrutiny at all that I can see in the Indian/international media of the personal
  <br/>
  background of the flight deck crew which has happened in other suspected pilot initiated disasters in the past, I guess this is an avenue investigators will have been doing themselves

    The aircraft achieved the maximum recorded airspeed of 180 Knots IAS at about 08:08:42
    <br/>
    UTC and immediately thereafter, the Engine 1 and Engine 2 fuel cutoff switches transitioned
    <br/>
    from RUN to CUTOFF position one after another with a time gap of 01 sec. The Engine N1
    <br/>
    and N2 began to decrease from their take-off values as the fuel supply to the engines was cut
    <br/>
    off.
    <br/>
    In the cockpit voice recording, one of the pilots is heard asking the other why did he cutoff.
    <br/>
    The other pilot responded that he did not do so.
    <br/>
    The CCTV footage obtained from the airport showed Ram Air Turbine (RAT) getting deployed
    <br/>
    during the initial climb immediately after lift-off (fig. 15). No significant bird activity is observed
    <br/>
    in the vicinity of the flight path. The aircraft started to lose altitude before crossing the airport
    <br/>
    perimeter wall.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As per the EAFR, the Engine 1 fuel cutoff switch transitioned from CUTOFF to RUN at about
    <br/>
    08:08:52 UTC. The APU Inlet Door began opening at about 08:08:54 UTC, consistent with
    <br/>
    the APU Auto Start logic. Thereafter at 08:08:56 UTC the Engine 2 fuel cutoff switch also
    <br/>
    transitions from CUTOFF to RUN. When fuel control switches are moved from CUTOFF to
    <br/>
    RUN while the aircraft is inflight, each engines full authority dual engine control (FADEC)
    <br/>
    automatically manages a relight and thrust recovery sequence of ignition and fuel introduction.
    <br/>
    The EGT was observed to be rising for both engines indicating relight. Engine 1&rsquo;s core
    <br/>
    deceleration stopped, reversed and started to progress to recovery. Engine 2 was able to
    <br/>
    relight but could not arrest core speed deceleration and re-introduced fuel repeatedly to
    <br/>
    increase core speed acceleration and recovery. The EAFR recording stopped at 08:09:11
    <br/>
    UTC
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As per the EAFR data both engines N2 values passed below minimum idle speed, and the
    <br/>
    RAT hydraulic pump began supplying hydraulic power at about 08:08:47 UTC.

  What the hell happened in the cockpit?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  08:08:42  Engine 1 and Engine 2 fuel cutoff switches transitioned from RUN to CUTOFF position.
  <br/>
  One of the pilots asks the other why did he cutoff.
  <br/>
  The other pilot responded that he did not do so.
  <br/>
  08:08:52 Engine 1 fuel cutoff switch transitioned from CUTOFF to RUN
  <br/>
  08:08:56 Engine 2 fuel cutoff switch also transitions from CUTOFF to RUN
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Who (or what?) operated the cutoff switches?

  That was with 10 seconds delay vs. 13 seconds for engine 2.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Time was spent with the verbal exchange, and then perhaps each pilot expected the other to put the switch back?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anyway, the preliminary report also establishes that the aircraft had only 3-4 seconds of powered flight. (Would the gear lever be operated that early?) Everyone who saw that from the CCTV video, pat yourselves on the back.

  Mayday call, dual engine failure, RAT deployment all confirmed.
  <br/>
  TCMA was a red herring, the aircraft was firmly in air mode as the accident unfolded, and the thrust levers were at takeoff thrust the whole time.

    There is mention of fire damage or thermal damage to the centre pedestal, perhaps enough to identify the position of the switches but not to be able to determine their internal physical state relating to the detent mechanisms.
   </div>
  </div>
  The photo of the engine switches in the report shows the toggle of both switches pretty clearly, with the caps burned off (to be expected, has zero effect on function, nor detent locking). The fact that the toggles and lower mechanism of each switch appears in the photo is pretty conclusive (a) to the position of the switches at the time of crash, and (b) that the locking detent function of the switch was functional as intended. I've worked with these switches for decades, and they are very robust. Their lesser cousin design, which also has a center detent lock position (double throw) are less robust that these (single throw) switches, and they last well too. Though I have seen them worn, I have never seen the locking function worn to the point of not functioning as a lock. And these switches would be too new to have experienced wear/damage to that point.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For myself, I have total confidence that the switches functioned as intended. Obviously they commanded the fuel valve as intended, and can be seen intact (other than the plastic caps), and in the run position, so it is safe to conclude that a mechanical/electrical fault of both independent switches at the same moment is unlikely in the extreme. The FDR data states that they were moved to "off" position, which caused the engine shutdown, then returned to "run", so they obviously were mechanically and electrically functional.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The automatic deployment of the RAT is an indicator of the airplane systems sensing an engine shutdown, as is the APU autostart. Pax 11A mentioned the green cabin lights, which, if I understand correctly is an indication of a complete electrical generation failure.The time of all these events can be plotted from recorded data, which I expect we'll see in a full report later. In the mean time, it all makes unfortunate sense.

     I imagine that what happened with engine 2 ("able to relight but could not arrest core speed deceleration and re-introduced fuel repeatedly to increase core speed acceleration and recovery") will be a major part of the investigation.
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  It won't be an issue, the cause is simply that they were below the airspeed needed for a successful airstart, the engine had spooled down too far to recover without being cranked and there was no power available from the APU yet.  As far as knowing how long they were from #1 providing meaningful thrust, you'd need to have a lot more data to know.  Another 30 seconds probably would have helped a lot.

  If I recall correctly, the Mayday call was wording to the effect "thrust not achieved". That sounds like a phrase which could be expected from a pilot who had just frantically tried to restart an engine, and realized that it was not a success, and there would not be an opportunity for another attempt. The pilot aviated, (forget navigation), then communicated - over a period of 13 seconds.

  Really? It suggests to me and I would imagine the vast majority of us who have flown modern Boeings that they were physically moved, by one of the crew, one at a time, the question is why.

  Believe I have read through all messages in this thread and the interim report twice.

    Few points I have not seen mentioned / discussed:
    <br/>
    <ul>
     <li>
      At no point was gear up commanded (and obviously initiated) ? Did we have a PRC call out ? Assuming they would have commanded gear up does the RAT (plus APU that was also powering up) produce enough hydraulics to perform it ? Assuming so, one might thing it would have given them those few extra seconds they needed for the engine to actually start pushing for real.
     </li>
     <li>
      From the satellite pictures and impact points it would seem they could have, by deviating slightly left or right, ended up into a forest / vegetation vs a building. Obviously a very easy call in hindsight but I guess worth mentioning.

  RAT doesn't help retracting the gear. Full conversation hasn't come out. First thing should have been positive rate but it appears engines started winding down as they got airborne so attention shifted to engines.

  SLF: I have a small observation but I'm not sure what it means or if it has any relevance to the accident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Previously I had assumed that the ADS-B data cut out at the same time as power was lost, so I imagined that whatever caused the fairly clear loss of thrust would have happened not too long before. But this report throws a bit of a wrench in my understanding of that.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the report, the fuel cutoff switches transition from RUN to CUTOFF at or very shortly after 08:08:42 UTC. Both engines' N2 values pass below minimum idle speed and the RAT begins supplying hydraulic power at about 08:08:47. Does this not imply that the generators have already been lost? With the APU also being off (the APU inlet door is noted to start opening at 08:08:54), I would have expected ADS-B data to cut out at or before 08:08:47. But curiously FlightRadar24 at least claims to have received data frames from the aircraft until 08:08:51.640970, almost five seconds later and almost ten seconds after the transition to CUTOFF (though the last frame containing coordinates comes at 08:08:50.871005).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Could anyone with relevant experience confirm how long it would take for AC power to be lost in this situation? Also, is it usual/unusual for a preliminary report like this to mention if/when the flight recorder switched to its independent power supply? I imagine it would definitely be in the final report, but I'd hoped it would be easily observable enough to be in this one.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beyond idle curiosity I'm asking because the report
  <i>
   also
  </i>
  says the no. 1 engine's cutoff switch transitioned from CUTOFF to RUN at "about 08:08:52", which oddly coincides with the last ADS-B data frame at 08:08:51.640970, and that seems important somehow. Or more likely I'm just ignorant of some quirk of the 787's electrical system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For reference FR24's CSV containing all ADS-B frames supposedly received from the aircraft can be found in their post here:

     10 seconds to respond is a long long time if you\x92ve just made a silly mistake, you\x92d have those switches back on in a second. The startle factor isn\x92t really a factor here, because you
     <b>
      know
     </b>
     what just happened.
     <br/>
     What is also unusual to me is the 4 second gap between moving Eng 1 fuel switch from cutoff to run, and moving Eng 2 fuel switch from cutoff to run.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     One would imagine that in this situation, speed of response would have been critical. Why the slow, deliberate \x91reaction\x92?
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  Bear in mind that if sampled at 1Hz, that 4s could be as short as 2 seconds in reality (or indeed as long as 6 seconds).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Either way, it's longer than you'd expect (subjectively) , and longer than it took to turn them off.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  *Speculation* could be due to attempted prevention of the action?
  <br/>
